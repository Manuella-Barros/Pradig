Though the company has communicated with the dealerships that use its software, no public-facing comments have been made since Wednesday afternoon.\n\nVery little is known about the attack, but CDK did notify users around 2 a.m. ET about the incident and that they had \"shut down a majority of [their] systems.\" No timeline has been provided as to when the systems will be operational, with the company only noting that they will inform users of the system as updates become available.\n\nThe automotive outlet Ford Authority reported that the software impacted includes several products, including CDK Service, Fortellis Integration Portal, Modern Retail CRM, and others, calling attention to the scope of the outage currently being experienced by users of these programs.\n\nThe company has not reported who could be behind the cyberattack, but this incident follows another on Findlay Auto Group that took place last week. No comments have been made that these attacks are connected, but they raise serious concerns about the security of the software, whose importance can not be underscored. BleepingComputer, an outlet dedicated to cyber security (among other topics), warned that the attack could mean the systems will be offline for days, and the incident taking weeks to resolve itself is not out of the realm of possibilities.", "source": {"uri": "as.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "as"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/N3QC6BJUSKIKMLAQJFJQ6L6GZI.jpg?auth=7ec98a733bcf3ed02d0af70a339e3f20d706ac21526f24c407b8e5fde8f25b58&width=644&height=362&focal=4179%2C2870", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Image Credit: Reuters\n\nThousands of car dealerships across the United States found themselves unable to operate due to a cyber incident at CDK Global, a major software provider for the automotive industry. The outage caused significant disruptions, halting operations and forcing dealerships to resort to manual processes.\n\nCDK Global responded by shutting down all systems and conducting extensive testing, consulting with external cybersecurity experts to address the issue.\n\nAccording to Tony Macrito, a spokesman for CDK, the company's core product -- a dealer management system -- along with its digital retailing solutions have been restored. CDK is currently testing other applications and will provide updates as they come back online.\n\nThe systems first went down around 2:00 AM Eastern Time, significantly impacting dealership operations.\n\nBrad Holton, vice president of Proton, a cybersecurity firm serving the auto industry, stated that CDK provided minimal information about the cause of the outage, leaving many dealerships in the dark. Some dealerships were completely shut down, while others had to switch to paper record-keeping for basic services such as oil changes.\n\nIn Manhattan, a BMW dealership informed customers that it had to stop all new business, including scheduling appointments and car servicing. A customer care representative admitted uncertainty about when operations would return to normal.\n\nSimilarly, at Barbera's Autoland in Philadelphia, receptionist Claire Glassmire reported that employees were unable to access customer records, set appointments, or print repair orders, forcing them to use makeshift solutions throughout the day.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, some CDK functions began to come back online, but many services were still down or not fully operational, according to Holton.\n\nDespite these widespread issues, a spokesperson for Toyota Motor Corp. mentioned that the problem had been resolved with minimal impact on their dealer network. Subaru Corp. also reported no significant impact.\n\nMike Stanton, president and chief executive of the National Automobile Dealers Association, emphasized the commitment of dealerships to protect customer information. He noted that dealers are seeking more information from CDK to understand the nature and scope of the cyber incident, enabling them to respond appropriately.\n\nCDK Global provides a range of services to dealerships, including online appointment scheduling, electronic signature capabilities, and messaging tools between divisions. This cyber incident highlights the heavy reliance of dealerships on these digital services for their daily operations.\n\nThe cyber incident comes in the wake of CDK's acquisition by Brookfield Business Partners in April 2022, in an all-cash deal valued at $6.4 billion. As the company navigates the fallout from the incident, it faces the challenge of restoring full functionality to its systems and addressing the concerns of its dealership clients.\n\nThis incident underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure of modern businesses, particularly in industries like automotive sales and services that depend heavily on integrated software solutions.\n\nThe recovery and future prevention strategies adopted by CDK Global will be closely watched by industry stakeholders, who are increasingly aware of the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookfield_Business_Partners", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brookfield Business Partners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Automobile_Dealers_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Automobile Dealers Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Employment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/06/New-cyberattacks-in-the-US-cripple-car-dealerships-causing-major-disruptions-across-industry-2024-06-058d9981491f705d1e290a901008284c-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

CDK was spun off from ADP in 2014. In mid-2022, it was acquired by venture capital firm Brookfield Business Partners and went private amid pressure from its activist investors to trim costs. Brookfield said at the time that it expected CDK \"to benefit from a rise in consolidation across the dealership industry,\" an industry estimated to be worth $30 billion by 2026.\n\nUnder CEO Brian McDonald, who returned to the firm after its private equity buyout, the company pushed most of its enterprise IT unit to global outsourcing firm Genpact in March 2023.\n\nCDK released a report on cybersecurity for dealerships in 2023. It noted that dealerships suffered an average of 3.4 weeks of downtime from ransomware attacks, or potentially an average payout of $740,144 (or even both). Insurer Zurich North America noted in a 2023 report that dealerships are a particularly rich target for attackers because \"dealerships store large amounts of confidential, personal data, including financing and credit applications, customer financial information and home addresses.\"\n\n\"In addition,\" the report stated, \"dealership systems are often interconnected to external interfaces and portals, such as external service providers.\"\n\nArs contacted CDK for comment and will update this post if we receive a response.

The disruption has taken the 15,000 car dealerships it serves offline. Although it remains unclear who is behind the cyberattack, CDK has been working with third-party experts to restore its systems.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, CDK announced that some systems were back online. \"With the work done so far, our core dealer management system (DMS) and Digital Retailing solutions have been restored. We continue to conduct extensive tests on all other applications and will provide updates as we bring those applications back online,\" CDK said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nMoreover, CDK Global's DMS is a critical hub that allows businesses to monitor operations from a single interface.

CDK touts its cybersecurity capabilities on its website, highlighting a three-tiered strategy to prevent, protect, and respond to cyberattacks.\n\nSome dealership employees turned to alternative methods to continue operations during the outage. Employees shared on Reddit that they were using spreadsheets and sticky notes to sell small parts and perform repairs, although large transactions were impossible. One employee from Wisconsin asked, \"How many of you are standing around because your whole shop runs on CDK?\" with confirmations from others in Colorado and beyond.\n\nThe incident underscores the vulnerability of critical systems and the widespread impact a cyberattack can have on business operations.

reports from media outlets including BleepingComputer.\n\n[Related: UnitedHealth Confirms Data Theft From Change Healthcare, 'Substantial' Number Of Americans Possibly Impacted]\n\nCRN has reached out to CDK Global for comment.\n\nWhat follows are five things to know on the CDK Global cyberattacks.\n\nFirst Attack\n\nOn Tuesday evening, CDK Global -- which provides SaaS-based CRM, payroll, finance and other functions to 15,000 dealerships -- reportedly became aware that it had been breached, according to BleepingComputer.\n\nIn response, CDK reportedly shut down its IT systems including logins and data center operations, leading to a widespread outage for car dealerships starting on Wednesday.\n\nSecond Attack\n\nWhile CDK was working to recover from the first attack, the company was struck by a second attack late on Wednesday evening, according to media reports.\n\n\"We are sorry to inform you that we experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on June 19th,\" reads a message to CDK customers posted Thursday on X.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the two attacks were related, according to TechCrunch.\n\nSystem Shutdown\n\nAccording to the message posted on X, the latest attack prompted CDK to shut down its systems for a second time.\n\n\"Out of continued caution and to protect our customers, we are once again proactively shutting down most of our systems,\" the message posted Thursday reads.\n\nIn a message to TechCrunch, a CDK spokesperson confirmed Thursday that the company has shut down \"most\" of its systems.\n\nNo Time To Resolution\n\nAccording to the message posted Thursday on X, CDK has been \"assessing the overall impact and consulting with external 3rd party experts.\"\n\n\"At this time, we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution and therefore our dealers' systems will not be available at a minimum on Thursday, June 20th,\" the message reads.\n\n\"We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\" the CDK spokesperson said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.\n\nImpact On Dealerships\n\nBloomberg reported Thursday that dealerships that depend upon CDK software were unable to access records, complete transactions, handle orders for repairs or schedule appointments.\n\nThe general manager of a dealership group in Maryland told the outlet that CDK software had been down since early on Wednesday.\n\nA dealership near Dallas, meanwhile, told Bloomberg that it has been handling sales

The company's core product - a dealer management system - and its digital retailing solutions have been restored, and CDK is testing all other applications and will provide updates as it brings them back online, Macrito said.\n\nCDK's systems, which many car dealerships rely on to conduct nearly all of their normal business, first went down around 2 a.m. Eastern time, said Brad Holton, vice president of Proton, a cybersecurity firm that serves dealers and the auto industry.\n\nHe said CDK provided little information on what caused the outage that effectively shuttered many dealerships. Some can't function at all and others have been forced to resort to paper record keeping for routine services like oil changes, Holton said.\n\nA BMW store in Manhattan told customers that it was forced to halt all new business, including scheduling appointments or car servicing. When asked how long its operations may be disrupted, a customer care representative for the store responded, \"I truly have no idea.\"\n\nOther dealerships also struggled to do business. \"We can't access customer records, can't set certain appointments.

Case's group has stores in Florida and Georgia using mostly CDK software programs for its parts, service, accounting, finance and insurance, vehicle inventory and cashier operations. Case said staff at her stores first became aware of glitches in CDK systems and the inability to log in on the morning of June 19.\n\nCase said the solution was to go back to pencil and paper.\n\n\"We'll just have to do it manually,\" she said. \"It's not different than when a hurricane comes and we're out of power. We'll just have to do everything by hand, then we'll have to recreate it. ...We're following the instructions CDK has given us to protect the integrity of our information.\"\n\nCDK Global by midafternoon said most of its core DMS functionality had been restored after it shut down most of its systems around the country in response to the early morning attack.\n\nCase, who's worked with CDK since 1979, said this type of problem hasn't happened before.\n\nRick Case Automotive ranks No. 25 on Automotive News' list of the top 150 dealership groups with 28,853 new vehicles retailed in 2023.\n\nAll locked up\n\nDSR Motor Group of Saco, Maine, is not a full CDK customer but uses the company's customer relationship management system. On June 19, the group's 12 stores could not access sales leads stored in the system.\n\nChecking those leads is a major part of dealerships' process, said David Rosenberg, DSR Motor's president. The New England group still has some leads from other sources but was mostly confined to fresh traffic, he said.\n\nEvery day, sales staff \"follow up on previous prospects that have not purchased a car yet,\" Rosenberg said. Now \"all that data is locked up.\"\n\nRosenberg said he hopes for more updates from CDK. As of the afternoon, he had received only an initial message about the cyber incident and a message from his CDK representative.\n\nIt has been a quiet day, June 19, at Lou Bachrodt Auto Mall of Rockford, Ill., said dealer Rachel Bachrodt. The auto mall, which sells General Motors, BMW and Volkswagen vehicles, uses CDK for almost every system, so they cannot process deals, sell parts, or handle repair orders. Bachrodt Auto Mall does not use CDK's customer relationship management system.\n\nThe dealership staff can do some parts of a deal by hand on paper, but the mall relies on printable forms that are stored in CDK. And the business cannot search its parts stock or even see where parts are shelved, Bachrodt said.\n\nWith few updates so far from CDK, Bachrodt Auto Mall as of mid afternoon June 19 was still assessing how the shutdown will impact business, Bachrodt said.\n\n\"We have power outages from time to time, like everybody, or the internet has gone out,\" she said. \"What will affect us is if this goes down for an extended period.\"\n\nEdwards Auto Group of Council Bluffs, Iowa, owns nine dealerships in that state and Nebraska. Co-owner Todd Edwards told Automotive News via email that they are CDK Global customers.\n\n\"We are dealing with this terrible situation as best we can,\" Edwards said. \"Accounting staff is unable to work and basic ability to open and close customer pay tickets in service is going to be tough to navigate.\"\n\nEdwards received an email around 3:30 p.m. from CDK saying services would be restored soon but didn't specify when.\n\nOld school\n\nEd Morse Automotive Group, one of the largest private dealership groups in the country, uses CDK Global at about 80 percent of its nearly 50 dealerships across multiple states.\n\nCEO Teddy Morse said he learned the news upon waking while in Colorado for business.\n\n\"That's a fun term to wake up to, by the way,\" Morse told Automotive News, quoting a text from his team: \"\u2009'There has been a cyber event.'\"\n\nMorse called CDK systems an important tool but said his team isn't completely reliant on them because his group will continue to take care of customers, and sell and service cars.\n\nEd Morse Automotive, of Delray Beach, Fla., ranks No. 53 on Automotive News' list of the top 150 dealership groups, retailing 18,660 new vehicles in 2023.\n\nErik Nachbahr, president of cybersecurity services provider Helion Technologies, said he has a dealership client who uses CVR, a CDK-owned company that lets dealers electronically issue registrations and temporary tags. But the local motor vehicle office is closed, which eliminates a backup for both tasks.\n\n\"The dealer is left with customers in the showroom who can't take deliveries of their vehicles even though their contracts are complete,\" Nachbahr said, adding that their CVR rep advised them to turn off the computer that runs the CVR application as a precaution.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com",

By Wednesday afternoon, the company had restored its core document management system and digital retailing solutions.\n\n\"We are continuing to conduct extensive tests on all other applications, and we will provide updates as we bring those applications back online,\" Finney said in an emailed statement.\n\nFinney did not respond to questions on how many dealerships were impacted, but CDK's website says the company works with more than 15,000 retail locations across North America.\n\nWhat does CDK Global do?\n\nOne of the leading providers of cloud-based software to dealerships in the country, CDK's software helps dealerships manage vehicle acquisitions, sales, financing, insuring, repairs and maintenance. The company's website says it offers a \"three-tiered cybersecurity strategy to prevent, protect and respond to cyberattacks.\"\n\nWhy are car dealerships targeted by cyber attacks?\n\nThe incident follows a cyber attack against Findlay Automotive Group last week. The automotive group - which operates in five states - said the attack restricted its ability to conduct sales and service, according to reporting from the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nA 2023 report from CDK notes that cybercriminals are a growing threat to target car dealerships, with 17% of 175 surveyed dealers experiencing a cyber attack or incident within the past year, up from 15% the year prior. Of those dealers, 46% said the cyberattack had a negative financial or operational impact.\n\nDealerships have been an attractive target because of the vast amounts of sensitive customer data they hold. From credit applications to customer financial information, dealerships hold a \"treasure of information\" to hackers, according to a 2023 article from insurance company Zurich North America.\n\n\"In addition, dealership systems are often interconnected to external interfaces and portals, such as external service providers,\" the report reads. And many dealerships \"lack basic cyber security protections.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Insurance_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Insurance Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Employment", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zCoK.wLwGWyQv_QqsKte7w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_money_325/d2bce2c8dc2d49ec72ced8c2e3ec672d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

'NOT A GOOD LOOK.'\n\n'It's Michigan, it's the entire country - about 15,000 dealers they service, so this is a big outage in our industry,' said Todd Szott, president of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association.\n\n'And hopefully it will be rectified soon.'\n\n'To me, it has all the looks and feel of a ransomware event,' cybersecurity expert David Derigiotis told Fox News.\n\n'We're dependent on technology, we're dependent on software and if there's any fail-point along the whole digital supply chain, it has ripple effects and that's what we're seeing with this exact example here.'\n\nThe attack took place just days after a separate hack which pushed the Findlay Automotive Group offline.\n\nInsurance company Zurich North America warned that dealerships are a prime target for hackers because they hold a 'treasure of information' on customers' credit applications and financial information.\n\n'In addition, dealership systems are often interconnected to external interfaces and portals, such as external service providers,' Zurich explained, with many dealerships lacking 'basic cyber security protections'.\n\nCDK produced figures suggesting attacks by cyber-hackers on individual car dealerships rose from 15 to 17 percent last year.\n\nIt boasts that it offers a 'three-tiered cybersecurity strategy to prevent, protect and respond to cyberattacks'.\n\nBut it was roasted on social media after the hack which brought much of the car retail industry to a grinding halt.\n\n'Instead of paying the ransom and not letting the data get leaked they shut everything down and now the data is going to get sold privately or leaked for free and CDK reputation is down the drain,' tweeted @RichOffMNQ.\n\n'Worst decision they have ever made.'\n\n'This CDK Global breach is a prime example of why businesses shouldn't be using shared services,' suggested John Marcum.\n\n'This whole #CDK situation is just insane,' added Sarah Brown. 'It's honestly mind boggling that in 2024 companies are not doing their due diligence to invest in heavy duty cyber security.\n\n'I really hope CDK is back up tomorrow, because the amount of work that

The CDK website says it is \"trusted\" to serve 15,000 dealer locations.\n\nWhile the company itself has not released any details on the attack - a Reddit thread called r/serviceadvisors suggested is a ransomware attack - although this has not been confirmed. It has also been claimed that CDK was forced to take two of its data centers offline due to the breach. Again, this is also unconfirmed.\n\nCyber security experts have questioned whether the SaaS platform's always-on VPN log-in system may have been a vulnerability that contributed to the attack.\n\nWhile the company has restored its core functions after the early morning breach on June 19th, it was forced to shut down its systems again later in the day on June 20th.\n\nAfter the first incident, CDK reportedly sent an email to clients which said: \"We experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on June 19th. Out of continued caution and to protect our customers, we are once again proactively shutting down most of our systems.\"\n\n\"We are currently assessing the overall impact and consulting with external 3rd party experts. At this time, we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution and therefore our dealers' systems will not be available at a minimum on Thursday, June 20th,\" the email reportedly added.\n\nIn a statement provided to Bloomberg, the company reiterated that it had \"shut all systems down, executed extensive testing, and consulted with external third-party experts.\"\n\nAccording to car dealership owners and service providers on X, the company has not been able to get its systems live, as its backup data centre was impacted too.\n\nConfirmed details on the nature of the attack remain sparse, and The Stack will update this story as they emerge.\n\nThis is the second cyberattack on car dealerships in recent weeks. Findaly Automotive Group was impacted by a cyberattack that compromised its systems on June 11th. Two of its customers have since filed a class action lawsuit, accusing the company of not taking enough precautions to protect their personal data.\n\nIn February 2024, UK-based car dealership JCT600 also suffered a cyberattack that prompted the company to take its systems offline.\n\nA report from Security Online notes that car dealerships are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. It estimated that dealerships' average ransomware payouts worked out to $228,125.\n\nIf the incident involves ransomware, the fee demanded of CDK Global could be much higher, since it is a SaaS with a multi-billion dollar valuation.", "source": {"uri": "thestack.technology", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Stack"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Login"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_1_Automotive", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Group 1 Automotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Employment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/size/w1200/2024/06/conor-samuel-K5BFXOsFp7g-unsplash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 480, "textEnd": 489, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1788, "textEnd": 1797, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 2974, "textEnd": 2983}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

But Thursday morning, the company sent dealerships another message indicating things had a taken a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Dear Valued Customers, We are sorry to inform you that we experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on June 19th,\" the Illinois-based company wrote in a message sent to car dealers. \"Out of continued caution and to protect our customers, we are once again proactively shutting down most of our systems.\"\n\nAt a minimum, the message said, computer systems would be down all day Thursday.\n\nA screenshot of the message was shared with CNN by an auto dealer who asked not to be named in order to protect their relationship with CDK.\n\nA CDK spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Thursday morning.\n\nCDK operates numerous different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK's products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many.\n\n\"We have customers coming in today who had deals saved in the system,\" said Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland.\n\nTo protect customer privacy, customers' details aren't written out on a piece of paper that's just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments iskept in a server that's now impossible for his salespeople to access.\n\nRamsey said he understands, though, that CDK is doing what it feels it must to secure this sensitive data. But it's a major hassle in the meantime and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that's not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead.\n\nIt's car buying season, so it's a real concern.\n\n\"We're in the summer months,\" he said. \"This is where we need systems functioning.\"\n\nRamsey and Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York, both said they were continuing to do business and were selling cars in spite of the problems.\n\n\"My selling team can hand-write a buyer's order,\" said Benstock.\n\nThe bigger hassles will be for the dealership's accountants and businesspeople, he said. Plenty of his employees have been in this business since before it became networked and computer dependent, he said, but it's still a problem and he's still worried about customer data.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Not every dealer uses CDK's products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but it's been a problem for many.\n\n\"We have customers coming in today who had deals saved in the system,\" said Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland.\n\nTo protect customer privacy, customer's details aren't written out on a piece of paper that's just sitting on the desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is kept in a server that's now impossible for his salespeople to access.\n\nRamsey said he understands, though, that CDK is doing what it feels it must to secure this sensitive data. But it's a major hassle in the meantime and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that's not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead.\n\nIt's car buying season, so it's a real concern.\n\n\"We're in the summer months,\" he said. \"This is where we need systems functioning.\"\n\nRamsey and Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York, both said they were continuing to do business and were selling cars in spite of the problems.\n\n\"My selling team can hand-write a buyer's order,\" said Benstock.\n\nThe bigger hassles will be for the dealership's accountants and businesspeople, he said. Plenty of his employees have been in this business since before it became networked and computer dependent, he said, but it's still a problem and he's still worried about customer data.\n\nA statement shared by CDK later in the afternoon said some of the company's system had been restored to operation but not all of them, yet.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_valdes_dapena@cnn.com", "name": "Peter Valdes-Dapena", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acura", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1234008824-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

States.\n\nCBS News reported that the company, which provides dealerships across the country with a software management system for its sales and other services, was forced to temporarily shut most of its systems down, effectively preventing about 15,000 dealerships from making sales.\n\nA CDK spokesperson said Wednesday (June 19) that the company was \"actively investigating a cyber incident\" involving its platform.\n\nThe company later said that some of its systems were back up and running after conducting tests and consulting with third-party experts.\n\nREAD NEXT: Australia Sues Medibank for Data Breach Due to Russian Hacking\n\nOn its website, CDK said it was providing a \"three-tiered cybersecurity strategy\" to prevent, protect, and respond to cyberattacks to defend dealerships.\n\nSome of CDK's most prominent customers are General Motors, Group 1 Automotive, and Holman.\n\nBleeping Computer reported that the cyberattack began Tuesday evening (June 18), taking about 15,000 dealerships it was serving offline.\n\nIt is understood that the person or group behind the cyberattack has not yet been identified.\n\nBecause of the outage, some dealerships relied on spreadsheets and sticky notes to sell customers small parts and make repairs to be productive for the day, while the hacking paralyzed them from making larger transactions.", "source": {"uri":

What we know so far about the attack with impacts nationwide.\n\nOn Wednesday, a massive cyberattack on CDK led car dealerships across the United States to pause their operations after they lost access to the system that facilitates vehicle sales. The company's website states that its software is being used by over 15,000 car dealerships across the country, highlighting the scale of the attack and how it has brought the sector to a halt in minutes. In a country where over 50 million cars are sold a year, one day can have serious consequences for businesses that are forced to turn away customers.\n\nAn X account with the handle GuyDealership posed that this cyber attack followed one on Findlay Auto Group last week and until this attack. While many investors are focused on the possibilities of integrating artificial intelligence into commercial sales, these attacks may shift the focus on enhancing cybersecurity to ensure that attacks of this nature are not able to happen.\n\nWhat we know about the attack so far\n\nVery little is known, and this story will be updated as more details are released.\n\nUsers of the software have been communicating about the outage on Reddit. One user posted a letter allegedly sent by the company, saying that they are \"currently experiencing a cyber incident\" and that \"out of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down a majority of our systems.\" The company did not provide a timeline for when they believed the software would be up and running again, leading many to voice frustration on the forum.\n\nImages of the letter were later posted by the GuyDealership, adding credibility to the initial reports circulating online.\n\nAdditionally, a note was added under the letter explaining that the \"notification is being sent to those experiencing the issue, as well as those who have the potential to experience the issue and have signed up for critical alerts.\" Another notification sent by the company later told customers that they \"recommend shutting down that access until we can confirm this is a viable path.\"", "source": {"uri": "as.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "as"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maite_knorr_evans@as.com", "name": "Maite Knorr-Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/4OI3FWZO5IWHCRFS6C6PTO2YIQ.jpg?auth=2b3b56b93377221f9650ee6a2d7712fd2863f7da2de6d8c4c62e34acd128231c&width=644&height=362&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The company has yet to make an official statement on the attack, be it that a spokesperson has provided some comments to media outlets.\n\nA spokesperson told Bloomberg via email that the company \"shut all systems down, executed extensive testing and consulted with external third-party experts.\" The same report notes that the company's core dealer management system and digital retailing solutions have since been restored and that CDK is also testing other applications before bring them back online.\n\nFounded in 2014, CDK provides data and technology solutions to the automotive, heavy truck, recreation, and heavy equipment industries.

Out of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible.\"\n\nLater that day the company announced that most of the critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company sent dealerships another message indicating things had a taken a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Dear Valued Customers, We are sorry to inform you that we experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on June 19th,\" the Illinois-based company wrote in a message sent to car dealers. \"Out of continued caution and to protect our customers, we are once again proactively shutting down most of our systems.\"\n\nAt a minimum, the message said, computer systems would be down all day Thursday.\n\nA screenshot of the message was shared with CNN by an auto dealer who asked not to be named in order to protect their relationship with CDK.\n\nA CDK spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Thursday morning.\n\nCDK operates numerous different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK's products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many.\n\n\"We have customers coming in today who had deals saved in the system,\" said Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland.\n\nTo protect customer privacy, customers' details aren't written out on a piece of paper that's just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is kept in a server that's now impossible for his salespeople to access.\n\nHow this affects buying a car now\n\nRamsey said he understands, though, that CDK is doing what it feels it must to secure this sensitive data. But it's a major hassle in the meantime and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that's not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead.\n\nIt's car buying season, so it's a real concern.\n\n\"We're in the summer months,\" he said. \"This is where we need systems functioning.\"\n\nRamsey and Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York, both said they were continuing to do business and were selling cars in spite of the problems.\n\n\"My selling team can hand-write a buyer's order,\" said Benstock.\n\nBut salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There's more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they're qualified for.\n\nNot just car sales, but parts and service can also be disrupted.\n\nThe bigger hassles will be for the dealership's accountants and businesspeople, Benstock said. Plenty of his employees have been in this business since before it became networked and computer dependent, he said, but it's still a problem and he's still worried about customer data.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

As a result, the cyber attack seems to have forced many auto dealerships to halt crucial operations.\n\n\"We have sent home the entire BDC (business development center) since they have nobody to call and can't schedule service appointments,\" wrote one Hyundai dealer on Reddit. \"I am manning the phones solo asking people to call back later. Service is dead in the water. We are still selling and showing cars and doing paper contract. I feel like a caveman.\"\n\nIndeed, some dealerships say they've resorted to using handwriting and paper documents to bypass the IT troubles with CDK's software. But others have been forced to halt most, if not all operations. \"Yeah all we can do is oil changes because we can't even look up any parts, all tied into CDK at our dealership,\" wrote another employee.\n\nIt remains unclear what caused the cyberattack, and whether it's related to ransomware. CDK didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company told Bloomberg it had to \"shut all systems down\" to conduct extensive testing in response to the cyber attack.\n\nCDK has since tried to restore access to the company's core dealership management product and its retailing solutions. But the company is now telling customers it experienced an \"additional cyber incident\" on Wednesday late in the evening. \"To protect our customers, we have taken down most of our systems,\" the company said over a hotline dedicated to the cyber attack.\n\n\"At this time, we do not have an estimated time frame for resolution and therefore our dealers' systems will not be available likely for several days,\" the hotline adds. \"As of now, our customer care channels for support remain unavailable as a precautionary measure to maintain security.\"", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_kan@pcmag.com", "name": "Michael Kan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02JZRIOSXqi6pZ51NvbTVp4-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1718902182.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

This reportedly pushed the company to \"shut down its IT systems, phones, and applications to prevent the attack's spread.\"\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, access was largely restored including to the all important dealer management system. Automotive News reports the investigation into the incident continues and the firm told them, \"We are continuing to conduct extensive tests on all other applications and we will provide updates as we bring those applications back online.\" CDK added, \"Our first priority is always the security of our customers, and our actions reflect our obligation to them as a trusted partner.\"\n\nWhile the incident appears to be largely resolved, a number of questions remain with the biggest being who was behind the attack and whether or not any sensitive data was accessed.

The first cyberattack hit CDK Global in the early hours of June 19, prompting the company to shut down its widely-used dealership management system (DMS) and leading to what Automotive News called \"chaos throughout the U.S. auto retail segment.\" The second cyberattack hit later in the evening of the same day, forcing another shutdown, which led some frustrated dealers to revert to handwritten notes to keep business humming along.\n\nCDK Global said it shut down its DMS \"proactively\" in an effort to protect the sensitive data of its customers, which includes 15,000 auto dealers in the U.S. and jumps to a total of 30,000 when accounting for truck dealers, per Auto News. CDK Global \"dominates its market by a wide margin\", according to analysts, meaning a large portion of American dealers rely on its software services to do business. The DMS that the hackers targeted is used by dealerships to process deals, order and sell replacement parts, and to handle repair orders. The CDK system also provides back-end software for vehicle inventory management, cashier operations, accounting departments, and -- everyone's favorite -- the finance and insurance departments of many major dealers.\n\nRather than let the cyberattacks bring business to a grinding halt for a span of two days, many dealerships scrambled to manually close on sales, order parts, and log service at their repair bays. The solution is to go low-tech for now, then input those sales and work orders once the DMS comes back online, as one Florida dealer tells Auto News. The dealer went on to say, \"it's no different than when a hurricane comes and we're out of power.\" That's technically true, but I don't know how many people are shopping for a car or dropping off for service in the middle of a hurricane evacuation. Oh, Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, a dealer in San Antonio, Texas, tells Auto News things have been \"rather normal on the service side,\" and that when a service manager asked if they should start turning customers away, the answer was \"absolutely not.\" It seems even a system-wide shutdown cannot prevent dealers from charging arm-twistingly high labor rates. The Texas dealer said that despite the annoyance, it was \"rockin' and rollin',\" scrawling repair orders by hand as techs looked up replacement parts online. (For any BMW dealerships affected, may I suggest RealOEM?)\n\nSome appear to be handling it better than others. The CEO of a major dealer group in Florida that uses CDK Global software at 80 percent of its locations told Auto News, \"People these days seem to have forgotten how to use a pencil...We can still take the customer's information; we can still write down their concerns. We can still take a piece of paper and walk it over to the technician and get the job done.\"\n\nFor its part, CDK Global says that it's taking the necessary steps to fully recover from the suspected cyberattacks, starting by assessing the impact with the help of third-party experts. It's also providing updates to its affected customers, though that could be of little relief to dealers. The full fallout of the cyberattacks is unclear beyond the DMS shutdown and any business lost due to the suspension. It's also still unclear how the hackers breached the widely-used DMS in the first place, but until CDK can restore functionality and patch up the security of its software, many U.S. dealers have little choice but to keep it old-school.", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_rodriguez_jr@thedrive.com", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Jr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDK_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CDK Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent_kinase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyclin-dependent kinase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_(grinding)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mill (grinding)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related Services", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/402831301_766725228800855_1374673372420358193_n-e1718904765333.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666023", "eventUri": "eng-9666023", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 386, "textEnd": 393}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

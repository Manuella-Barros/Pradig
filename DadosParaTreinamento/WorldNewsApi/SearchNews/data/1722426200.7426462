{"id": 243309266, "title": "3 Top Dividend Stocks to Maximize Your Retirement Income", "text": "Here's an eye-opening statistic: older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself. Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies. In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working. For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future. That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million. In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035. How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income. Invest in Dividend Stocks As a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek. Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions. A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time. Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio. General Mills (GIS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.6 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.68%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.61%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 9.26%.

The annualized dividend growth of the company was 4.17% over the past year.

To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market. An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time. Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees. If you're thinking, \"I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,\" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges. Bottom Line Pursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.

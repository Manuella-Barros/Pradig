PSP other leaders were also present on the occasion.\n\nLambasting MQM Chief Altaf Hussain, he said it is an honour for me that \"I belong to Urdu-Speaking community and I am proud of it. Whereas I supported MQM and its chief for about 30 years but after knowing about Altaf nefarious agenda, I and Mohajir community no longer support this party.\"\n\nHe said that during last 30 years Mohajir Community voted for MQM nine times and also supported its welfare organisation by donating animals hides and paying Zakat but now the time is change and Mohajir community members does not blindly follow the orders of Altaf Hussain.\n\nKamal further said that for long it was considered that Altaf Hussain was the voice of Mohajir community and whatever Altaf said was believed to be the voice of Mohajirs. But now the community no longer wants to be affiliated with Altaf, said PSP Chairman adding that people has seen the real face of Altaf Hussain and this image is completely different from the beliefs of Mohajir community.\n\nTalking about the video clip gone viral on social media in which Pakistani flags were burnt, Kamal narrated that MQM chief Altaf Hussain directed its followers to observe \"Black Day\" on Independence Day of Pakistan but Mohajir community paid no attention to it, instead marked the Independence day with great zeal and fervor.\n\nHe further added that it was a planned and MQM London based leadership provided the Indian TV channels with videos and photographs of the burning Pakistani flag. This entire episode is nothing other than promoting propaganda against the country.\n\nOn the occasion, Kamal once again reiterated his demand and calling establishment of the country, he said that you should give amenity to the people of Karachi as you gave to the people of Balochistan.\n\nFurther lambasting MQM-Pakistan, Kamal said that MQM Pakistan chapter were completely providing assistance to MQM chief Altaf Hussain. Mayor Karachi is collecting money and sending it to London. MQM-P is for sale now and it is group of dishonest people running after their lucrative interests remarked PSP chairman. He further alleged that MQM-P supporters were also involved in the incident of burning Pakistani flags.\n\nOn the other hand, MQM-Pakistan convener Dr Farooq Sattar responding to PSP chairman Mustafa Kamal press conference denied that allegations levelled by PSP Kamal.\n\nAddressing a press conference at MQM-P temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad Karachi along with the other member of party coordination committee, Sattar dismissed PSP's Kamal notion that the men burring flags were the member of Mohajir Community.\n\nHe said that few people were incited to commit this deed but MQM-P has nothing to do with this and our patriotism has not been affected by anyone else.

The credit for thwarting the [MQM-London's] scheme goes to MQM-Pakistan.\"\n\nReiterating that MQM-Pakistan was not linked with Altaf anymore, Dr Sattar said that the Coordination Committee , which is the decision-making body of the MQM, made changes in its constitution to strip the party founder of the powers he enjoyed.\n\nAlmost a year has passed since MQM split into the two factions of MQM-Pakistan and MQM-London, spearheaded by Dr Sattar and Nadeem Nusrat respectively. The division occurred after a controversial and incendiary speech of the MQM founder on August 22, 2016 in which he advocated the abolishment of the sovereignty of the country.\n\nMustafa Kamal extends olive branch to Farooq Sattar\n\nDuring the press conference, the MQM-Pakistan chief also made jibes about his rivals, the Pak Sarzameen Party led by former city nazim Mustafa Kamal and the Pakistan Peoples Party, which is ruling the province. Dr Sattar asked Kamal to focus on national politics and leave the issues of Muhajirs to him and MQM-Pakistan. Moreover, he welcomed the Sindh High Court decision that halted the process of repealing the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.

In 2012, he said the Government of Pakistan was radical, and supported the Taliban, thereby was an enemy of US and freedom, and was one of two Congressmen who moved a bill in 2016 for the US to declare Pakistan \"a terrorist state.\"\n\nDawood went into self-exile after the assassination of Baloch nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Bugti in 2006.

The meeting lasted for four hours and members of MQM's Rabita Committee attended the meeting.\n\nWhen contacted, a MQM spokesman said the US Congressman expressed his sorrow over the rights abuses and assured the MQM leader that he will take up his party's case at the US congress and other forums.\n\nThe spokesman confirmed that Khan of Qalat had also attended the meeting and agreed with Altaf Hussain that they will work together for the common cause. The MQM said it had been agreed that all \"like-minded\" people will work together in future and increase coordination.\n\nMeeting with the openly hostile US Congressman comes after Altaf's trusted lieutenant Nadeem Nusrat met Senator John McCain, Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Ted Poe in Washington at the end of June to seek their help.\n\nAfter The News and Geo TV published details of these meetings, including MQM-London's recent intervention at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, MQM-Pakistan's leader Farooq Sattar accused the London chapter and his former comrades of working against the interests of Pakistan and for shaking hands with the hostile elements known for their anti-Pakistan bias.\n\nFarooq Sattar said Nadeem Nusrat's meetings in Washington were part of London faction's \"anti-Pakistan agenda and continuation of 22nd August speech\" by Altaf Hussain. Farooq Sattar said: \"Nadeem Nusrat is involved with anti-Pakistan lobby in the US. We will not allow whatever MQM-London is doing in the name of Urdu speaking community. Representatives of Muhajirs are here along with their workers and supporters. The MQM founder should avoid using the name of Muhajirs. Demand that the US congress block Pakistan's aid is ridiculous,\" Farooq sattar said, adding that no one will be allowed to bring Muhajirs to disrepute.\n\nReplying to Farooq Sattar, MQM London's Nadeem Nusrat defended meeting with the US politicians and seeking help against Pakistan. He said MQM-London had been left with no choice after Altaf Hussain's 22nd August speech which saw ban being imposed on his speeches and fragmentation of MQM into three groups.\n\nMQM-London has made overtures to exiled Baloch factions in recent days and expressed its intention to work with them but no leading Baloch group has replied affirmatively. Mehran Baloch, exiled Baloch leader who campaigns at the UN level, has said that MQM at its peak was involved in actions against Baloch living in Karachi and discriminated against them.\n\nMehran Baloch said that MQM went out of its way to target Baloch people in Karachi during its reign. He and other Balochs have ruled out working with the MQM-London but MQM-London has grown closer to Khan of Qalat who had sought asylum in the UK vowing to take Pakistan to International Court of Justice but failing to do so in over ten years. The Khan of Qalat has previously held events in London with Congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Ted Poe against Pakistan.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T00:23:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1724, "date": "2017-08-22", "freq": 2, "textStart": 1713, "amb": false, "imp": true}], "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3368949", "time": "00:23:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3368949", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "178", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48579", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "86522", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302584", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "score": 4}, {"id": "302949", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "score": 3}, {"id": "304059", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "score": 3}, {"id": "304323", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "score": 4}, {"id": "305157", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "score": 3}, {"id": "305248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "United Nations Human Rights Council"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council", "score": 3}, {"id": "309441", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baloch people"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people", "score": 4}, {"id": "369063", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Farooq Sattar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farooq_Sattar", "score": 4}, {"id": "369065", "label": {"eng": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttahida_Qaumi_Movement", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "369067", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Altaf Hussain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaf_Hussain", "score": 5}, {"id": "394094", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muhajir people"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhajir_people", "score": 4}, {"id": "487737", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ted Poe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Poe", "score": 3}, {"id": "499351", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Geo TV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_TV", "score": 3}, {"id": "718646", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dana Rohrabacher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rohrabacher", "score": 4}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "00:23:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "MQM founder holds long meeting with anti-Pakistan US Congressman", "originalArticle": null}

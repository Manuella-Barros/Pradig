{"id": 243351912, "title": "Miriam Lord\u2019s Week: Fianna F\u00e1il TDs rack up the air miles after recall from China junket", "text": "James O\u2019Connor, the Fianna F\u00e1il backbencher for Cork East who was recalled home from China to vote in the D\u00e1il on Wednesday, has returned to Beijing to complete his junket to the Far East. \u201cHe\u2019s spent more time in the air this week than some of those Aer Lingus pilots,\u201d remarked one Fianna F\u00e1il deputy upon hearing the news of O\u2019Connor\u2019s quick turnaround. He flew out last Friday to the Chinese capital with party colleagues P\u00e1draig O\u2019Sullivan, the TD for Cork North-Central, and Louth-based Senator Erin McGreehan. However, with two crucial votes set to take place the following week, party leader Miche\u00e1l Martin contacted the two TDs on Monday night and ordered them back to base. The party did not clear the two travellers for take-off, although we understand they told colleagues they had independently arranged voting pairs for themselves. A pairing arrangement is when an opposition TD agrees to facilitate the absence of a government TD by not voting, thus cancelling each other out. The two Cork deputies were rather peeved at having to fly halfway around the world to be present for the D\u00e1il votes. Their disgruntlement was noted by \u201csympathetic\u201d colleagues in the Members\u2019 Bar who found the incident highly entertaining. The fact that the three Fianna F\u00e1ilers had been away came as a surprise to many in the party, who heard nothing about trips to China and were rather put out by this. They presumed it was arranged by the Ireland-China Parliamentary Friendship Group (there are 48 such groups in the Oireachtas) as O\u2019Connor is its convener. He was one of three members of the group who officially visited China in September when Zheng Jianbang, vice-chairperson of the standing committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress, met them at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The other two were Barry Cowen, now Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s new MEP in Midlands North West, and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh. Journalist Ken Foxe reported last month that the friendship group\u2019s September trip to China was the most expensive trip undertaken by TDs and Senators last year, coming in at over \u20ac20,000. The flights cost \u20ac17,000 and the accommodation bill came in at \u20ac3,171 with smaller sums paid for subsistence and miscellaneous items. However, this latest excursion is not a Friendship Group trip and was neither arranged nor funded by Leinster House, where it is presumed that the Chinese are footing the bill. The FF Three are not representing their party either \u2013 a spokesperson indicated on Friday that it wasn\u2019t informed of their plans. The Irish Times was unable to contact any of the three intrepid politicians on Friday although some colleagues said O\u2019Sullivan did not fly back to China. But \u201cBaby of the D\u00e1il\u201d James O\u2019Connor, the youngest TD in Leinster House, was back on another flight to Beijing in no time. \u201cAt this rate the lad\u2019s carbon footprint will be longer than the Great Wall of China,\u201d marvelled a fascinated colleague. The Ireland-China Parliamentary Friendship Group is not to be confused with the Irish wing of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which highlights human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party and is co-chaired by Senators Barry Ward and Malcolm Byrne. Daly\u2019s disembodied voice D\u00e1il proceedings had to be suspended on Wednesday morning when Fianna F\u00e1il Senator Mark Daly interrupted his party leader Miche\u00e1l Martin during Questions on Foreign Affairs, and several efforts had to be made to remove him from the chamber. It happened during a robust exchange between Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Matt Carthy and the T\u00e1naiste over the proposed reappointment of Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president. Just as the Fianna F\u00e1il leader was rejecting Carthy\u2019s charge that if the Government backed her it would \u201cignore the fact that she gave a green light to genocide\u201d, a disembodied voice boomed out around the D\u00e1il chamber. Miche\u00e1l was stopped in his tracks. So was Matt, along with the small handful of TDs present. They craned their necks and swivelled their heads. The quizzical expression on Miche\u00e1l\u2019s face was a joy to behold, for it was, unmistakably, the voice of Senator Daly, a former cathaoirleach of the Seanad. One of the monitors positioned around the back of the chamber is permanently tuned into the Seanad \u2013 only picture, no sound. Minister of State Sean Fleming turned to the T\u00e1naiste and said: \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been usurped in the D\u00e1il by a Senator.\u201d Matt Carthy told him: \u201cI bet that\u2019s not the first time that particular Senator has disrupted you.\u201d Miche\u00e1l had sacked the Kerry politician as his party\u2019s deputy Seanad leader and spokesperson for foreign affairs after he took part in an unsanctioned launch for a Fianna F\u00e1il election candidate in Northern Ireland in 2018. [ Fianna F\u00e1il disciplines Senator over candidate \u2018launch\u2019 in North ] Se\u00e1n told us what happened: \u201cIt took a minute for people to cop on to where the sound was coming from \u2013 up in the far corner opposite the Government benches. One of the ushers rushed to get the remote control and ran up the steps to mute it. But nothing happened. \u201cThen another usher arrived with a chair and he stood on it to try and push the \u2018off\u2019 button but he couldn\u2019t find any buttons. \u201cSo the next thing was to send for an electrician, but it would be at least five minutes before he arrived and as we couldn\u2019t talk because Mark was so loud the Leas-Cheann Comhairle suspended the House.\u201d The electrician eventually arrived with a different remote. He put Mark off and everyone else out of their misery. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Miche\u00e1l is still having nightmares about it. Miche\u00e1l\u2019s man in finance If Fine Gael can have the youngest-ever Taoiseach then Fianna F\u00e1il can have the youngest-ever Minister for Finance. To celebrate the elevation of Jack Chambers (33\u00bd) to Minister of Finance, the party released a 13-second video featuring a delighted Miche\u00e1l Martin showing how he is down with the kids by shaking hands in his office with Chambers of Commerce, who so doesn\u2019t care that he isn\u2019t even wearing a tie with his edgy navy suit. That\u2019s the young people for ya. The video shows JC 33 in a suit and shaking hands with the President before striding in slow-mo down the ministerial corridor wearing nothing but a navy suit, white shirt and tie. Then the action cuts to Jack, minus his jacket and tie, executing a basketball shot and the cringefest finishes with him posing with his seal of office in the garden of \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, like he\u2019s made his confirmation. But best of all is the soundtrack featuring the viral tune Man in Finance by Megan Boni. She repeats \u201cI\u2019m looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6ft 5in, blue eyes ...\u201d We fear poor Megan is barking up the wrong tree here. In January, the Minister announced on social media that he is gay. We hope Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s people didn\u2019t steal the finance man idea from the young people in the Green Party, who used it weeks ago in an election video for Grace O\u2019Sullivan. Unfortunately, she lost her seat. Ticket to Tuscany TDs and Senators received a desperate cri de coeur from Fianna F\u00e1il backbencher Robert Troy on Thursday morning. \u201cColleagues, Unfortunately, having secure (sic) two tickets for Andrea Bocelli open air concert in his hometown of Tuscany, Italy, I now can\u2019t go. Concert is on Friday 19th July and tickets are \u20ac180 each. Let me know if interested. Best, Robert.\u201d The Longford-Westmeath TD\u2019s message went out to all Oireachtas members and very many of them immediately forwarded it to us. The concert sounds lovely. It will be in the open-air Teatro del Silenzio (Theatre of Silence, a novelty for any member of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann) in the town of Lajatico near Pisa. There were some replies to Robert\u2019s email, though no takers that we know of yet. Independent TD Thomas Pringle responded: \u201cIs that Tuscany, Co Westmeath or Longford?\u201d Fine Gael Senator from Cavan Joe O\u2019Reilly couldn\u2019t oblige either. He wrote \u201cGreat follow up question, Thomas. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m from Big Tom country.\u201d And some politicians might even have been humming one of Andrea Bocelli\u2019s greatest hits in Robert\u2019s vicinity. \u201cTime to ... say goodbye ...\u201d Celibate dads On Wednesday, Senator R\u00f3n\u00e1n Mullen had a lot to say during the remaining stages of the landmark Bill on surrogacy and assisted human reproduction. He would be talking still if it hadn\u2019t been guillotined. \u201cOn this issue of surrogacy, the mainstream media in this country has been the dog that has not barked, and it has failed, largely speaking, to shine a light on the Government\u2019s bizarre, cruel and perverse proposals such as the ones I have just described. The reason for that is simple. It is always easier to focus on real-life human interest stories and we have celebrities who have obtained children through celibacy,\u201d he declared, before realising his slip of the tongue. \u201cCelibacy? Celibacy? Good lord,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cSurrogacy!\u201d he shouted with a laugh. Fine Gael\u2019s Mary Seery Kearney interjected: \u201cThey are allowed have children as well.\u201d R\u00f3n\u00e1n chuckled: \u201cBut of course, it does allow it, actually, through celibacy, now that you mention it. But you have this bizarre situation where high-profile people have been able and enabled to have children through surrogacy.\u201d Celibate dads, says R\u00f3n\u00e1n. To paraphrase that famous line from Father Ted: \u201cI hear you\u2019re a surrogate father now, Father.\u201d OWLs honoured The Leinster House OWLs were honoured this week by Ceann Comhairle Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl at a graduation ceremony in the LH 2000 complex. Seven graduates completed the 2022-2024 Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) programme, which is an applied learning, development and socialisation scheme for young adults with an intellectual disability. The Houses of the Oireachtas is the first parliament in the world to host an initiative of this kind. The graduates in this year\u2019s programme were placed across different offices in Leinster House and in various Government departments including Finance, Agriculture and Tourism, where they gained valuable work experience in multiple areas. The Ceann, who launched the award-winning programme in 2018, told the Super Seven and their friends, families and workmates that one of the key values of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to be inclusive. \u201cI hope you will be happy and fulfilled as you go forward in your new roles in employment and in further education. I wish every one of you the success you clearly deserve.\u201d Laughing matters Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh introduced his wonderfully titled Arts (Recognition of Comedy) Bill in the D\u00e1il on Thursday. It\u2019s no laughing matter, he told the House. The art of comedy has been recognised since the ancient Greeks, and comedians should be recognised for State funding along with other members of the arts community. \u201cWe could say this is no laughing matter and make various puns. We have all watched and listened to comedians and enjoyed it. When times are dark, sometimes that\u2019s the best form of medicine. However, unless we are willing to give them their proper due, respect and access to funding, it just makes it more difficult, especially for up-and-coming artists, to do it.\u201d Funnily enough, TDs and Senators who have offices in the Leinster House 2000 annex were taken aback on Wednesday when they saw a clown in full costume making his way through the building to the Fine Gael offices. It turns out he was hired by Senator Mary Seery Kearney to entertain the children who came to Leinster House with their parents for a photocall on the surrogacy Bill. Mary shouldn\u2019t have wasted her money employing a clown. Plenty of them around Leinster House who would have done the job for free.

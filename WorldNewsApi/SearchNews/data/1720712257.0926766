On Wednesday\u2019s episode of his podcast, \u201cSalty with Captain Lee,\u201d the superyacht captain said things took a turn for the worse after Radke made a guest appearance on the broadcast following his breakup with Lindsay Hubbard. \u201cCarl and I used to be close and I gave Carl an opportunity to be on the podcast and tell it as he saw it,\u201d Rosbach, 74, said. \u201cThere was a question he wanted taken off. We took it off. There was something he didn\u2019t want to answer, we didn\u2019t put him on the spot. We didn\u2019t hang him out to dry.\u201d Rosbach said his chat with Radke, 39, was a \u201csoftball interview if I\u2019ve ever seen one,\u201d adding that he \u201cwould never have done something intentionally to put Carl on the spot.\u201d Shortly after the podcast was teased last November, the \u201cDeadly Waters With Captain Lee\u201d star said Radke called him and \u201cdemanded\u201d he not air the interview. \u201cI got a phone call from Carl and he just went off how I was taking advantage of him and trying to put him on the spot,\u201d Rosbach explained. \u201cI was blown away. I don\u2019t know what made him go off the way he went off or why he thought what he was thinking. I really don\u2019t have a clue to what he was thinking.\u201d Rosbach said he told his fellow Bravolebrity he wouldn\u2019t air the episode. \u201cIt bothers me because I was trying to do whatever I could to help Carl through this difficult time that he was going through. That\u2019s why I wanted to give him the opportunity to tell his side of the story because everybody deserves to have their opinion heard and what they perceive to be facts,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to give him that opportunity. And then to be slapped around for it didn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d Page Six has reached out to a rep for Radke for comment but did not immediately hear back. Rosbach and Radke became close after bonding over the fact that they both lost family members to addiction. Last November, a preview clip of the podcast episode the part-time Loverboy employee did with Rosbach was released to the public. Radke admitted that he felt \u201creally bad\u201d about his engagement to Hubbard, 37, ended. \u201cIt\u2019s been scary. It\u2019s been confusing. It\u2019s been emotional. And I feel really bad with how everything ultimately played out,\u201d he said on the \u201cSalty With Captain Lee\u201d podcast at the time, per Us Weekly. He also said that if he \u201ccould go back and make something a little bit easier or better, I would.\u201d However, the episode never aired in full and Rosbach is missing a podcast show for a week in November.", "summary": "The captain said things took a turn for the worse after Radke made a guest appearance on his podcast following his breakup with Lindsay Hubbard.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/09/entertainment/below-deck-alum-captain-lee-rosbach-reveals-why-his-friendship-with-carl-radke-ended/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/83526845.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V6XubSx6-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:23:13", "author": "Tamantha Ryan", "authors": ["Tamantha Ryan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.564}

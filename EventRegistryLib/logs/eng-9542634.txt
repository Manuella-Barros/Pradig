If you live in SC, get checked for whooping cough", "body": "Whooping cough cases have been reported in South Carolina with a rise from last year's numbers.\n\nAccording to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), SC has seen a total of 52 whooping cough cases in total in 2024. In the Upstate, 47 cases were reported, followed by four in the Lowcountry and one in the Midlands.\n\nLast year, the state only reported a total of six cases.\n\nDr. Martha Buchanan, interim director of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Prevention and Control at DHEC, does not consider the numbers unusual.\n\n\"If you look at our data, I mention the rise in cases. But if we look back from 2017 to about 2023 to see complete data from those years' cases, some years we have 200 cases in South Carolina. Some years we only have about 30 cases. So it's natural for us to see case rates for all diseases to go up and down. They're kind of cyclical,\" Buchanan said.\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nWhooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection that causes symptoms like coughing in the respiratory tract. The cough will oftentimes be accompanied by a \"whoop\" sound at the end of a coughing attack. In severe cases, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite may occur, according to Buchanan. If you have a lingering cough that has not gone away as expected, scheduling an appointment with your primary health physician to get tested for pertussis is the best course of action.\n\nHow is the infection transmitted?\n\nLike most respiratory illnesses, whooping cough is spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. The respiratory droplets are then breathed in by nearby individuals.\n\nHow is the infection prevented?\n\nVaccination is the best way to protect yourself and others from coming down with pertussis. Effective and safe vaccinations against infection include the following:\n\n\u220e Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccines: This vaccine is intended for babies and children under seven years of age.\n\n\u220e Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines: This vaccine is intended for older children and adults.\n\nIf you do get pertussis, DHEC strongly recommends staying home until you recover from the sickness, covering your cough, and washing your hands.\n\n\"It's a preventable disease and we really encourage everybody to make sure they stay up to date on their vaccines,\" said Buchanan.\n\nWho is susceptible to whooping cough?\n\nPeople who are not vaccinated with the DTaP or Tdap vaccines are more likely to contract pertussis. Preteens, teenagers, and the elderly are also at higher risk of infection. Infants, in particular, should be kept away from those who have pertussis because they cannot receive the vaccination.\n\n\"Pertussis can be dangerous for very young infants because their airways are so small and because of inflammation of the airways. It can really cause a lot of babies to end up in the hospital if they get pertussis.\" Buchanan said.", "source": {"uri": "greenvilleonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Greenville News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tetanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anorexia (symptom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2022/08/15/USATODAY/usatsports/imageForEntry2-PJS.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

The vaccine is safe, and extremely effective.\"\n\nProfessor Andrew Preston, from the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath, added: \"It is extremely sad news to hear of the deaths of five babies, especially as whooping cough is a vaccine preventable disease.\n\n\"While no vaccine is perfect, pertussis vaccination of mums during pregnancy and of infants protect the babies and infants who are the most vulnerable to this serious, and sometimes fatal, disease.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabelle_bates@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Isabelle Bates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placenta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bath", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Bath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service (England)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southampton", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southampton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29137879.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS180817401jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

Here the PA news agency answers commonly-asked questions on the condition.\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nThe bacterial infection, also known as pertussis, affects the lungs and breathing tubes. Whooping cough is sometimes called the \"100-day cough\" because of how long it can take to recover from it, and it spreads very easily.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of whooping cough?\n\nThe first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold and can include a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. Young babies may also make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise.\n\nWho is most affected?\n\nThe majority of cases (51%) have been diagnosed among people aged 15 and over but the condition is most serious in babies. Between January and the end of March, 108 babies under the age of three months were diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\nHow many cases have there been?\n\nThere were 2,793 cases reported between January and the end of March, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures. In March alone, some 1,319 cases were reported. There were 556 cases recorded in January and 918 in February.\n\nHow does this compare to previous years?\n\nThere were 858 cases for the whole of 2023.\n\nWhy are cases so high?\n\nHealth officials at the UKHSA describe whooping cough as a \"cyclical disease\", which means it peaks every few years. With whooping cough this peak usually occurs every three to five years. The last big increase was seen in 2016.\n\nBut cases dipped to very low numbers during the coronavirus pandemic - likely due to a lack of socialising and social distancing measures - which means the current peak is \"overdue\", the UKHSA said. It added the impact of the pandemic means there is \"reduced immunity in the population\". Vaccination rates have also decreased in recent years.\n\nWhat can people do to protect themselves?\n\nPregnant women are being urged to take up the offer of the whooping cough vaccine so they can pass on protection to their babies, which should last until they are old enough to get vaccinated themselves. Parents are also being advised to take up the offer of vaccination for children when called forward.\n\nWhen can people get vaccinated?\n\nThe NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against whooping cough between 16 and 32 weeks. When a baby is eight weeks old they are offered the six-in-one vaccine, which includes immunisation against whooping cough.\n\nThe second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks. When children are three years and four months old they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "ella_pickover@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Ella Pickover", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_smith@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Steven Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing_measures_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.gazettelive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article28796426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_coughing-toddler.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nHealth officials describe whooping cough as a \"cyclical disease\", which means it peaks every three to five years. The last big increase was seen in 2016, but cases dipped to very low numbers during the coronavirus pandemic - which means the current peak is \"overdue\", the UKHSA said.\n\nHealth officials added that the impact of the pandemic means there is \"reduced immunity in the population\". In March alone, some 1,319 cases were reported, according to the provisional data, while there were 556 cases recorded in January and 918 in February.\n\nSymptoms of whooping cough\n\nAccording to the NHS, the first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat, although a high temperature is uncommon. The main symptoms as listed by the health service, which will appear after around a week and can last for several weeks or months, include:\n\nCoughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night A \"whoop\" sound - a gasp for breath between coughs (young babies and some adults may not \"whoop\") Difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants) Bringing up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit Becoming very red in the face (more common in adults)\n\nIf you or your child has symptoms of whooping cough, it's important to stay off school, work or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or three weeks after your symptoms started if you have not had antibiotics.\n\nYou should ask for an urgent GP appointment or seek help from NHS 111 if your baby is under six months old and has symptoms of whooping cough, or if you or your child have a very bad cough that is getting worse. You should also seek medical advice if you have been in contact with someone who has whooping cough and you're pregnant, or you have a weakened immune system.\n\nWhooping cough can also lead to serious complications, particularly in babies under six months old, including dehydration, breathing difficulties, pneumonia and seizures. You should call 999 or go to A&E if you or your child's lips, tongue, face or skin suddenly turn blue or grey, if they are finding it hard to breathe properly, or if they have chest pain that is worse when breathing or coughing, as this could be a sign of pneumonia.\n\nTreatment for whooping cough\n\nTreatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you have had the infection. Hospital treatment is usually needed if you have severe whooping cough, or your baby is under six months old and has whooping cough, according to the NHS website.\n\nIf whooping cough is diagnosed within three weeks, you will be given antibiotics to help stop it spreading to others - antibiotics may not reduce your symptoms, but it's important to take the whole course in order to prevent the infection from coming back. If you have had whooping cough for more than three weeks, you're no longer contagious and do not need antibiotics.\n\nAnyone suffering from whooping cough is advised to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids, and paracetamol or ibuprofen can help to relieve discomfort. However, the NHS urges against cough medicines, as they are not suitable for young children and will not help with this type of cough.\n\nWho can get the whooping cough vaccine?\n\nPregnant women are being urged to take up the offer of the whooping cough vaccine so they can pass on protection to their babies, which should last until they are old enough to get vaccinated themselves. The NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against whooping cough between 16 and 32 weeks.\n\nWhen a baby is eight weeks old they are offered the six-in-one vaccine, which includes immunisation against whooping cough. The second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks, and when children are three years and four months they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis among other infections.\n\nProfessor Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\"", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ella_pickover@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Ella Pickover", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "catherine_addison_swan@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Catherine Addison-Swan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunodeficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29138102.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Doctor-giving-COVID-19-coronavirus-vaccine-injection-to-pregnant-woman-Doctor-Wearing-Blue-Gloves.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\"\n\nBut what is whooping cough and what are the symptoms?\n\nWhooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. According to the NHS, it can be mistaken for a cold in its early stages. A runny nose and sore throat are typically the first signs of the infection. The NHS said:\n\nBabies and young children, especially young babies under six months of age, are at an increased risk of complications of whooping cough. For older children and adults, it tends to be less serious in these cases but can still be unpleasant.\n\nThose who have previously had whooping cough are not immune to it -- although it tends to be less severe the second time around.\n\nAnd, for those vaccinated against whooping cough as a child, protection from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off after a few years.\n\nIf you have a baby under six months old who has started to develop whooping cough symptoms, you should speak to a doctor as soon as possible.

If you live in SC, get checked for whooping cough", "body": "Whooping cough cases have been reported in South Carolina with a rise from last year's numbers.\n\nAccording to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), SC has seen a total of 52 whooping cough cases in total in 2024. In the Upstate, 47 cases were reported, followed by four in the Lowcountry and one in the Midlands.\n\nLast year, the state only reported a total of six cases.\n\nDr. Martha Buchanan, interim director of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Prevention and Control at DHEC, does not consider the numbers unusual.\n\n\"If you look at our data, I mention the rise in cases. But if we look back from 2017 to about 2023 to see complete data from those years' cases, some years we have 200 cases in South Carolina. Some years we only have about 30 cases. So it's natural for us to see case rates for all diseases to go up and down. They're kind of cyclical,\" Buchanan said.\n\nWhooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection that causes symptoms like coughing in the respiratory tract. The cough will oftentimes be accompanied by a \"whoop\" sound at the end of a coughing attack. In severe cases, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite may occur, according to Buchanan. If you have a lingering cough that has not gone away as expected, scheduling an appointment with your primary health physician to get tested for pertussis is the best course of action.\n\nLike most respiratory illnesses, whooping cough is spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. The respiratory droplets are then breathed in by nearby individuals.\n\nVaccination is the best way to protect yourself and others from coming down with pertussis. Effective and safe vaccinations against infection include the following:\n\n\u220e Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccines: This vaccine is intended for babies and children under seven years of age.\n\n\u220e Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines: This vaccine is intended for older children and adults.\n\nIf you do get pertussis, DHEC strongly recommends staying home until you recover from the sickness, covering your cough, and washing your hands.\n\n\"It's a preventable disease and we really encourage everybody to make sure they stay up to date on their vaccines,\" said Buchanan.\n\nPeople who are not vaccinated with the DTaP or Tdap vaccines are more likely to contract pertussis. Preteens, teenagers, and the elderly are also at higher risk of infection. Infants, in particular, should be kept away from those who have pertussis because they cannot receive the vaccination.\n\n\"Pertussis can be dangerous for very young infants because their airways are so small and because of inflammation of the airways.

Between January and the end of March, 108 babies under the age of three months were diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\n- How many cases have there been?\n\nThere were 2,793 cases reported between January and the end of March, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures.\n\nIn March alone, some 1,319 cases were reported. There were 556 cases recorded in January and 918 in February.\n\nHealth officials at the UKHSA describe whooping cough as a \"cyclical disease\", which means it peaks every few years. With whooping cough this peak usually occurs every three to five years.

New data published on Thursday, May 9 by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows cases of whooping cough continue to increase with 1,319 cases confirmed in March.\n\nThis follows 556 cases in January and 918 in February, bringing the total number of cases in 2024 to 2,793. Sadly, in the first quarter of 2024 from January to March, there have been five infant deaths. Young infants are at highest risk of severe complications and death from whooping cough, according to the UKHSA.\n\nWhile most cases were in those aged 15 years or older who usually get a mild illness, the rates of whooping cough remain highest in babies under three months of age.\n\nDr Vanessa MacGregor, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control at UKHSA East Midlands, said: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\n\"Pregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\n\"All babies are given three doses of the six in one jab at eight, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio with a pre-school booster offered at 3 years 4 months.\n\n\"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nWhooping cough cases have been rising across England and other countries since December 2023. It is a cyclical disease that peaks every three to five years.\n\nThe last cyclical increase occurred in 2016. However, in common with other diseases, cases fell to very low numbers during the pandemic due to restrictions and public behaviours. A peak year is therefore overdue. The impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population.\n\nUptake of vaccinations that protect against whooping cough have fallen in recent years across the country - in both the programme for pregnant women and the infant programme. Timely vaccination in pregnancy and in infancy are both important to protect vulnerable young babies from serious disease.\n\nNHS National Medical Director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\n\n\"Whooping cough, clinically known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection which affects the lungs. The first signs of infection are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. Young babies may also make a distinctive 'whoop' or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise which means whooping cough can be hard to recognise.\n\n\"If anyone in your family is diagnosed with whooping cough, it's important they stay at home and do not go into work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics. This helps to prevent the spread of infection, especially to vulnerable groups, including infants. However, vaccination remains the best protection for babies and children.\"", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_hennessy@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Peter Hennessy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9150714.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_embedded9481668.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 172}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

That's more than three times the amount recorded in the whole of last year. The worrying new figures released by the UK Heath Security Agency (UKHSA) show there were 2,793 cases reported to the end of March. This is compared with the 858 cases for the whole of 2023. The UKHSA confirmed that between January and the end of March, there have also been five infant deaths.\n\nWhooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways, says the NHS. It causes repeated coughing bouts that can last for two to three months or more, and can make babies and young children in particular very ill. Whooping cough is spread in the droplets of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection.\n\nSymptoms of whooping cough appear similar to those of a normal cold with \"a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat and a slightly raised temperature\" states the NHS. This is then followed by the key sign of coughs that begin a week later where there are bouts that last for a few minutes and are more common at night. The coughing may bring up thick mucus and could lead to vomiting.\n\n\"Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath - this may cause a 'whoop' sound, although not everyone has this,\" states the NHS. \"The strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes. Young children can sometimes briefly turn blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing - this often looks worse than it is and their breathing should start again quickly.\n\n\"In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing. The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time, but it may be a few months before they stop completely.\"\n\nWho's at risk of whooping cough\n\nWhooping cough can affect people of any age, including:\n\nbabies and young children - young babies under 6 months of age are at a particularly increased risk of complications of whooping cough older children and adults - it tends to be less serious in these cases, but can still be unpleasant and frustrating people who've had whooping cough before - you're not immune to whooping cough if you've had it before, although it tends to be less severe the second time around people vaccinated against whooping cough as a child - protection from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off after a few years When to go to the GP showing whooping cough symptoms have a cough for more than three weeks have a cough that is particularly severe or is getting worse\n\nUKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\" Dr Amirthalingam also said vaccination remains the best form of defence against the Victorian-era disease. He explained: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\n\"Pregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\n\"All babies are given three doses of the 6 in 1 jab at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio with a pre-school booster offered at 3 years 4 months. Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious.

Updated estimates of vaccine effectiveness during pregnancy show a high level of protection against infant mortality (92%).\n\nAlthough most cases (50.8%, 1420 people) during this quarter occurred in those aged 15 years and older with mild disease, the incidence of pertussis is still highest in infants under 3 months of age.\n\nPertussis cases are increasing in the UK, as well as in several other countries, from December 2023 due to a combination of factors. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every three to five years. The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016. However, like other diseases, restrictions and public behavior during the pandemic have reduced cases to very low numbers. Therefore, this is the year when the peak season is delayed.

Make an appointment with your GP or get help from NHS 111.\n\nWhooping cough, clinically known as whooping cough, is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs. The first signs of infection are similar to a cold, including a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection may develop into a cough that lasts several minutes and is usually worse at night. Coughing followed by a distinct hissing sound or difficulty breathing. However, not all babies make this sound, so whooping cough can be difficult to recognize.\n\nIf anyone in your family has been diagnosed with whooping cough, it is important to stay home and avoid work, school, or day care until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after symptoms started if you did not take antibiotics. . This helps prevent the spread of infection, especially to vulnerable groups, including infants.

Live a healthier, happier life with the free weekly Living Well newsletter.\n\nFive babies have died in the UK after being diagnosed with whooping cough, prompting a warning about the disease.\n\nAs of 2024, more than 2,700 cases of whooping cough have been reported across the UK. This is more than three times the figure recorded for all of last year.\n\nNew UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show 2,793 cases were reported by the end of March.\n\nThis compares to 858 for all of 2023.\n\nUKHSA said there were five infant deaths between January and the end of March.\n\nUKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said: Whooping cough can affect people of all ages, but can be very serious in very young babies.\n\nOur thoughts and condolences are with the family who so tragically lost their baby.\n\nAccording to provisional data, 1,319 cases were reported in March alone.\n\nFive babies have died after being diagnosed with pertussis (PA) in the UK this year (PA archive)\n\nThe bacterial infection, also known as whooping cough or whooping cough, can be especially serious in very young children and, in very rare cases, can be fatal.\n\nThe numbers tend to increase every few years, and we believe the increase in social contact since the pandemic is now playing a part.\n\nAlways consult your doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment advice, and seek urgent help if you have signs of difficulty breathing.\n\nWhat does whooping cough sound like?\n\nWhile many coughs are caused by the common cold virus, whooping cough is a bacterial infection (the medical term for whooping cough).\n\nWhooping cough often presents as a normal cough or cold at first, but you may notice symptoms getting worse after a week or two, says Dr. Kathryn Basford, of Zava, an online doctor. While a typical cough may go away within a few weeks and feel mild, whooping cough can last much longer, even months.\n\nThe main difference to note between a mild cough and whooping cough is its intensity. Whooping cough involves a strong coughing sound, especially at night, and a high-pitched whooping cough, especially when the person has difficulty breathing. Vomiting, flushing, and difficulty breathing may also occur.\n\nAnd unlike a normal cough, whooping cough is much more contagious. If you have not yet been vaccinated against whooping cough, it is recommended that you see your doctor to get vaccinated. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications and spread.\n\nHow do you catch whooping cough?\n\nWhooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads through the air through tiny droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Basford says these droplets can be inhaled by others nearby.\n\nBacteria can also remain on surfaces touched by an infected individual and can be transmitted indirectly by someone else touching the surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. That's why maintaining good respiratory hygiene, including washing your hands frequently and covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing, is important to prevent the spread.\n\nExperts urge pregnant women to get the whooping cough vaccine to protect their babies (PA) (PA archive)\n\nIs whooping cough contagious to adults?\n\nBasford explains: Whooping cough most commonly affects young children, but adults can also get it. Adults usually experience milder symptoms than children.\n\nCan whooping cough be serious?\n\nWhooping cough can certainly be serious, especially in young babies who have not yet been vaccinated. Young children, in particular, may have trouble breathing during a coughing fit, which can lead to complications such as pneumonia and, in some rare and serious cases, death, Basford warns. Even in adults, persistent coughing can be debilitating, causing sleep problems and making daily activities difficult.\n\nHow else can you prevent it?\n\nThe best way to avoid serious whooping cough is to get vaccinated. This vaccine is given to your baby as part of the routine NHS immunization schedule and then as part of the kindergarten booster immunization. Pregnant women should also be vaccinated to protect their babies after they are born. This is available for between 16 and 32 weeks.\n\nHow is whooping cough treated?\n\nTreatment for whooping cough depends on several factors, including age and how long the cough has lasted. Infants younger than 6 months are at higher risk for complications and often require hospitalization and special treatment, Basford says.\n\nIf diagnosed early (within 3 weeks), antibiotics may be helpful. Medication may not make you feel better any faster, but it plays an important role in stopping the spread. However, if it has been more than 3 weeks, antibiotics may not help because you are likely no longer contagious.\n\nFocus on symptom management. Get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and use a cool mist humidifier to relieve coughing. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol may also help relieve discomfort.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paracetamol"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/08/10/5d48be6c-e552-4f7f-b39b-25b8f254f83b.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

This compares to just 858 cases of whooping cough for the whole of 2023.\n\nFive infants are also known to have died in between January and March 2024.\n\nDr Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health told ITV News these figures are significant - but not unprecedented.\n\n\"The data is definitely concerning,\" he said.\n\n\"We do see large outbreaks of whooping cough on a cycle every few years but the one we're seeing at the moment is big.\"\n\nBut what has caused this most recent spike in cases, and how simple is it to tell the difference between whooping cough and a regular cough?\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nWhooping cough is a infection of the lungs and airways. It is caused by bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, and is very contagious.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe first signs of whooping cough are similar to those of a cold, such as a runny nose and a sore throat.\n\nSymptoms then progress after about a week into coughing bouts lasting a few minutes, which might get worse at night. Coughing can last for weeks or months.\n\nThose with the illness may make a 'whoop' sound, caused by gasping for breath between coughs - but this does not happen everyone with whooping cough.\n\nIt can cause breathing difficulties, with young infants turning blue or grey and adults becoming red in the face after coughing bouts.\n\nWhooping cough may also bring up thick mucus, which can cause vomiting.\n\nHow is it different to a normal cough?\n\nDr Head explained whooping cough is similar to other kinds of respiratory illness in the early stages.\n\nHe said: \"You'll have some kind of cough, and perhaps a runny nose or a fever. It is very, very hard to tell the difference at that stage between whooping cough and anything else.\n\n\"You can only really notice it's whooping cough later on in the presentation when that distinctive 'hoop' sound kicks in.\"\n\nGiven not everyone experiences this symptom, the illness is difficult to accurately diagnose without laboratory testing, according to Dr Head.\n\n\"That's another reason why it is hard to get outbreaks under control and why vaccination is vital,\" he said.\n\nHow serious is it?\n\nWhooping cough can lead to serious and sometimes deadly complications in babies and young children.\n\nAround a third of babies under the age of one with whooping cough will need hospital care.\n\nComplications can include apnea (life-threatening pauses in breathing), pneumonia, convulsions and encephalopathy (disease of the brain).\n\nTeenagers and adults can also experience complications, but they are generally less serious in those who are older.\n\nWhat has caused this recent outbreak?\n\nAccording to Dr Head, outbreaks of whooping cough happen every few years.\n\nHe said: \"The reasons are not totally clear but will be related to drops in vaccine uptake and probably waning of immunity in older children and younger adults.\n\n\"Once you get to that sort of nine or ten years of age, the immunity from the vaccines does start to wear off. Waning of immunity and any lower vaccine uptake does mean the vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women are more likely to be exposed.\"\n\nDr Head believes the time of year could explain the uptick in cases across the past few months.\n\n\"The reason why we see respiratory infections during the winter is that people will cluster indoors. If it's cold and wet, if you're indoors with little ventilation, the window shut, then there's many opportunities for that bacteria to spread,\" he said.\n\nHow is it treated?\n\nThose with severe whooping cough, or babies under 6 months with the illness, will need hospital treatment. It is treated with antibiotics.\n\nHow contagious is it?\n\nPeople with whooping cough are contagious from about six days after the start of cold-like symptoms to three weeks after the coughing starts.\n\nStarting antibiotics within three weeks of starting to cough can reduce the time someone is contagious for.\n\nDr Head explained whooping cough is about as contagious as measles, which is one of the most infectious diseases around.\n\n\"It has an R number of 15 to 17, so one infected person can potentially infect 15 to 17 other separable people,\" he said.\n\n\"It's also mostly in the upper respiratory tract meaning it is easier to spread because the bacteria are nearer the the the mouth and nose.\"\n\nIs there a vaccine?\n\nAll babies are offered a whooping cough vaccination as part of routine NHS vaccines. It is given as part of the six-in-one vaccine for babies at eight, 12, and 16 weeks old.\n\nIt's also administered in the four-in-one pre-school booster, for children aged three years and four months old.\n\nThe NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against whooping cough between 16 and 32 weeks.\n\nDr Head said: \"High vaccine coverage is vital to maintain each and every year to protect pregnant women and babies. Otherwise, we get outbreaks like we're seeing this year.\n\n\"If you are recommended for vaccine, then do take up the offer for you or your child.\"\n\nWhat should those worried about whooping cough do?\n\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if:\n\nCall 999 or go to A&E if:\n\nVisit the NHS website for more advice.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_pertussis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bordetella pertussis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encephalopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/7IhFLd0I50ILghE8wNfY0G/e3e7a639924ae08b41d61943f91abc50/pexels-cottonbro-5858712.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Some 51% of cases during this period were among those aged 15 and older.\n\nHealth officials describe whooping cough as a \"cyclical disease\", which means it peaks every few years. With whooping cough this is every three to five years.\n\nThe last big increase was seen in 2016, but cases dipped to very low numbers during the coronavirus pandemic which means the current peak is \"overdue\", the UKHSA said.\n\nIt added the impact of the pandemic means there is \"reduced immunity in the population\".\n\nUKHSA also said vaccine uptake has fallen in recent years - both the jabs for pregnant women and children.\n\nDr Amirthalingam added: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\"\n\nThe NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against whooping cough between 16 and 32 weeks.\n\nImmunity from the jab passes through the placenta to protect newborn babies in their first weeks of life.\n\nWhen a baby is eight weeks old they are offered the six-in-one vaccine, which includes immunisation against whooping cough.\n\nThe second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks.\n\nWhen children are three years and four months they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis.\n\nProfessor Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\"\n\nUKHSA said the first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night.\n\nYoung babies may also make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise which means whooping cough can be hard to recognise.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported 1,319 cases in England in March, after just over 900 in February, making the 2024 total nearly 2,800.\n\nThe last peak year, 2016, had 5,949 cases in England. The infection - known as the 100-day cough - can be particularly serious for babies and infants. Half of cases seen so far this year have been in the under-15s, with the highest rates in babies under three months of age.\n\nThe five babies who died this year were all under three months old. These are the first deaths since 2019.\n\nREAD: How to tell what insect has bitten or stung you - and when to be worried Some bites and stings can potentially be life-threatening, but there are ways to tell them apart\n\nREAD:Doctor says five simple letters could tell if you have skin cancer 17,500 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancers every year, and early diagnosis helps with the outcome\n\nUKHSA has said a steady decline in uptake of the vaccine in pregnant women and children and the very low numbers seen during the pandemic, as happened with other infections because of restrictions and public behaviour, were both factors.\n\nThe agency said a peak year was therefore overdue and urged families to come forward to get vaccinated if they had not already.\n\nBelow, PA news agency provides answers to frequently asked questions about the illness.\n\nWhat exactly is whooping cough?\n\nThis bacterial infection, also known as pertussis, targets the lungs and airways. Often referred to as the \"100-day cough\" due to the lengthy recovery period, whooping cough is highly contagious.\n\nCould you describe the symptoms of whooping cough?\n\nInitially, whooping cough presents cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose and sore throat. However, approximately a week later, it can progress into severe coughing fits that last several minutes and are often more intense at night.\n\nInfants may produce a characteristic \"whoop\" sound or struggle to breathe after coughing, although not all exhibit this symptom.\n\nWho does it affect the most?\n\nWhile individuals aged 15 and above account for 51% of diagnoses, the disease poses the greatest risk to babies. In the first quarter of the year, 108 infants younger than three months were diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\nWhat's the extent of the outbreak?\n\nFrom January to March, there were 2,793 reported cases, per UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data. March saw 1,319 cases alone, with 556 in January and 918 in February.\n\nHow does this stack up against previous years?\n\nThere were a total of 858 cases reported throughout the entirety of 2023.\n\nWhat's behind the surge in cases?\n\nExperts at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) explain that whooping cough is known to be a \"cyclical disease\", with peaks occurring every three to five years. The most recent significant rise was observed in 2016.\n\nHowever, during the Covid-19 pandemic, instances of whooping cough were unusually low, likely due to reduced social interaction and adherence to social distancing guidelines. As a result, the current spike is considered \"overdue\", according to the UKHSA.\n\nThe agency also noted that the pandemic has contributed to \"reduced immunity in the population\". Additionally, vaccination rates have seen a decline over the past few years.\n\nHow can individuals safeguard themselves?\n\nExpectant mothers are being strongly encouraged to accept the whooping cough vaccine to convey immunity to their newborns, which should sustain until the infants are eligible for their own vaccinations. Parents are likewise being reminded to ensure their children receive vaccinations when invited.\n\nWhen is vaccination available?\n\nThe NHS advises that all pregnant women should receive the whooping cough vaccine between the 16th and 32nd weeks of pregnancy. At eight weeks old, babies are offered the six-in-one vaccine, which includes protection against whooping cough.\n\nThe second jab is offered at 12 weeks, followed by a third at 16 weeks. Once children reach the age of three years and four months, they are offered the four-in-one pre-school booster to protect against pertussis.\n\nSign up to our main daily newsletter here and get all the latest news straight to your inbox for FREE", "source": {"uri": "stokesentinel.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hayley_parker@stokesentinel.co.uk", "name": "Hayley Parker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_smith@stokesentinel.co.uk", "name": "Steven Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skin cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melanoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.stokesentinel.co.uk/incoming/article9274848.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_GettyImages-1399541745.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

This follows 556 cases in January and 918 in February, bringing the total number of cases in 2024 to 2,793.\n\nSadly, in the first quarter of 2024 (January - March), there have been five infant deaths. Young infants are at highest risk of severe complications and death from whooping cough. Updated estimates of vaccine effectiveness in pregnancy shows high levels of protection (92%) against infant death.\n\nDuring this quarter, while most cases (50.8%, 1420) were in those aged 15 years or older who usually get a mild illness, the rates of whooping cough remain highest in babies under 3 months of age.\n\nWhooping cough cases have been rising across England, as well as in many other countries, since December 2023 due to a combination of factors. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every 3 to 5 years. The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016. However, in common with other diseases, cases fell to very low numbers during the pandemic due to restrictions and public behaviours. A peak year is therefore overdue. The impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population.\n\nUptake of vaccinations that protect against whooping cough have fallen in recent years across the country - in both the programme for pregnant women and the infant programme. Timely vaccination in pregnancy and in infancy are both important to protect vulnerable young babies from serious disease.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Consultant Epidemiologist at UK Health Security Agency, said:\n\nVaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\nPregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\nAll babies are given three doses of the 6 in 1 jab at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio with a pre-school booster offered at 3 years 4 months.\n\nWhooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\n\nNHS National Medical Director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said:\n\nWith cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\nIf you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\n\nWhooping cough, clinically known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection which affects the lungs. The first signs of infection are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. Young babies may also make a distinctive 'whoop' or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise which means whooping cough can be hard to recognise.\n\nIf anyone in your family is diagnosed with whooping cough, it's important they stay at home and do not go into work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics. This helps to prevent the spread of infection, especially to vulnerable groups, including infants. However, vaccination remains the best protection for babies and children.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported 1,319 cases in England in March, and just over 900 in February, making the 2024 total nearly 2,800.\n\nKnown more commonly as the '100-day cough', the infection can be particularly serious for babies and infants, and cases tend to peak every three to five years. With growing fears that figures will continue to rise this year, here is all you need to know about the illness and how it is treated.\n\nHistory of whooping cough Whooping cough, or pertussis, was discovered in 1906\n\nThe literal meaning of pertussis in Latin is \"a violent cough\" and it was first described in the Paris epidemic of 1578.\n\nBordetella pertussis, the bacteria that causes it, was discovered in 1906 and a vaccine was developed in the 1940s. In the 12 years before the NHS started offering all pregnant women a vaccine against it in 2012 there were 63 deaths in babies under one. In the next ten years there were 21 such deaths but they have tended to cluster in outbreak years. Experts say 2024 appears to be another one of those with five deaths recorded in just the first three months.\n\nWhy is it bad?\n\nWhooping cough is as infectious as measles and more infectious than Covid-19.\n\nIt spreads because of its long period when patients with it can be infectious of up to three weeks. It is also known as the \"100-day cough\" because of how long it can take to recover from. Half of cases seen so far this year have been in the under-15s, with the highest rates in babies under three months of age for whom it is particularly dangerous.\n\nThe NHS says babies under six months old are at increased risk of problems such as dehydration, breathing difficulties, pneumonia and seizures. In older children and adults violent coughing fits can cause sore ribs and even lead to a hernia or ear infections\n\nDr Michael Head, global health expert at Southampton University, said: \"Whooping cough can have a very long infectious period of around two to three weeks. \"Thus there may be plenty of opportunities for people to mix, transmission to occur, and for there to be an infection of a vulnerable individual, such as a baby.\"\n\nWhat is causing the outbreak?\n\nWhooping cough is considered a cyclical disease which peaks every three to five years.\n\nThe last big increase was seen in 2016 before the Covid-19 pandemic reduced social contacts so we are due a bounce back. Vaccination uptake has also dropped with rates among pregnant women falling from more than 70% in 2017 to 58% in 2023.\n\nThe number of two-year-olds who completed their routine six-in-one vaccinations, which includes protection against whooping cough, was 92.9% in 2023 compared with 96.3% in 2014. Infections began to rise a little from last summer but have really surged since December 2023.\n\nDr Head said: \"Outbreaks can occur in cycles so we tend to see these rises in cases every few years. The reasons for that are not fully understood but population-level waning immunity is likely to contribute to that, hence why a high coverage of vaccination is so important.\"\n\nWhat should we look out for? The infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes\n\nThe UKHSA says the first signs of whooping cough infection are similar to a cold such as a runny nose and sore throat.\n\nHowever, after about a week the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes that are typically worse at night. Young babies may also make a distinctive 'whoop' - a gasp for breath between coughs. But some adults and young babies do not make this noise which can make the condition harder to recognise.\n\nThe NHS says some may bring up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit, while adults may be left red in the face from coughing. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England Medical Director, said: \"If you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\"\n\nThe UKHSA warns that if anyone in your family is diagnosed with whooping cough they should stay home and not attend work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics.\n\nWho can get vaccinated and when?\n\nHealth chiefs are now highlighting the dangers of whooping cough to try to reverse drops in vaccine uptake against it.\n\nThe NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against pertussis between 16 and 32 weeks. Immunity from the jab passes through the placenta to protect newborn babies in their first weeks of life. When a baby is eight weeks old they are offered the six-in-one vaccine which includes immunisation against whooping cough.\n\nThe second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks. When children are three years and four months they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster which protects against pertussis.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_bagot@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Martin Bagot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_pertussis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bordetella pertussis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hernia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Otitis media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32773185.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Baby-girl-3-5-months-having-vaccine-injected-in-arm-with-syringe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The UKHSA worries this means it may be a 'bumper' year for the infection after the last peak was in 2016 with 5,949 cases.\n\nThe NHS describes whooping cough (also known as pertussis) as a bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes. It can cause serious issues, especially among children and babies, which is why the health service recommends vaccinating against it.\n\n\"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time,\" Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam of the UKHSA told the BBC.\n\n\"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages, but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nThe UKHSA has seen a steady decline in children completing their vaccinations over the past decade.\n\nIn 2023, just 92.9% of two-year-olds had completed their six-in-one vaccinations, which protects against whooping cough, compared to 96.3% of the same age group in 2014. It added that the maternal pertussis vaccine, which is offered to pregnant women, dropped from 70% in 2017 to 58% in 2023.\n\nThis phenomenon could be described as 'vaccine hesitation', with a growing number of people hesitant to vaccinate their children.\n\nWhat is vaccine hesitancy?\n\n\"Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise in recent years due to a confluence of factors,\" Dr Joseph Ambani tells Yahoo UK. \"Misinformation spread through various channels, including social media, has fuelled scepticism and eroded trust in vaccines and the healthcare system.\n\n\"Additionally, a growing emphasis on individual autonomy and distrust in authority figures has contributed to a culture of vaccine hesitancy. Cultural, religious, and ideological beliefs also play a significant role, influencing perceptions of vaccine necessity and safety.\"\n\nHe adds that addressing vaccine hesitancy requires a 'multi-faceted approach' that involves providing accurate information and promoting the importance of vaccination for individual and community health.\n\n\"Among parents, concerns about vaccine ingredients, potential side effects, and perceived conflicts of interest within the medical community can contribute to hesitancy,\" he adds. \"The decline in infant vaccination rates against whooping cough can be attributed to a combination of these factors, compounded by the dissemination of misinformation through social media platforms and anti-vaccine advocacy groups.\"\n\nSigns of whooping cough\n\nThe first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold, like a runny nose and sore throat. However after around a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night, according to the UKHSA. Young babies may also make a distinctive 'whoop' sound - hence the name - or have difficulty breathing after coughing. But it's important to note not all babies make this noise, meaning whooping cough can be hard to recognise.\n\nIt is a highly contagious disease and infants are particularly vulnerable to it thanks to their underdeveloped immune systems.\n\nWhy vaccinations against whooping cough is important\n\n\"Complications of whooping cough in infants can be severe and even life-threatening, including pneumonia, seizures, apnoea, and brain damage,\" Dr Ambani warns. \"Tragically, infants under the age of one year are at the highest risk of mortality from pertussis infections.\"\n\nThis is why he urges parents to vaccinate their children against the condition, both to protect the child and to contribute towards herd immunity.\n\n\"[Herd immunity] is crucial for protecting vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated, such as newborns too young to receive the vaccine and individuals with certain medical conditions,\" Dr Ambani says. \"By ensuring high vaccination coverage rates in the population, we create a protective barrier against the spread of whooping cough, safeguarding the health of our communities.\"\n\nTo find out more about whooping cough, visit the NHS information page here.

\"overdue\", the UKHSA said.\n\nIt added the impact of the pandemic means there is \"reduced immunity in the population\".\n\nUKHSA also said vaccine uptake has fallen in recent years - both the jabs for pregnant women and children.\n\nDr Amirthalingam added: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines

cough.\n\nThe second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks.\n\nWhen children are three years and four months they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis.\n\nProfessor Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the

Parents were also told to look out for symptoms in children, including a runny nose, sore throat and a \"whooping\" noise when coughing and seek urgent medical help.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency reported 1,319 cases in England during March, which was up from 918 in February and 556 in January. There were just 858 cases of the \u00ad\"100-day cough\", which can also cause brain damage, in the whole of last year.\n\nA fall in \u00advaccinations has been blamed for a national outbreak since the turn of the year - along with \u00adweakened immunity due to a lack of social mixing in lockdowns. Latest data shows uptake of the vaccine offered to all pregnant women to protect newborns plummeted from more than 70% in 2017 to 58% last year.\n\nParents are being urged to get the jab for their children (stock image) Preventable\n\nThe number of two-year-olds who had routine six-in-one jabs, which includes whooping cough protection, fell from 96.3% in 2014 to 92.9% in 2023. The babies who died of the disease, officially called pertussis, were all under three months old and they fell ill in the first three months of this year.\n\nNHS England's Medical Director Professor Sir Stephen Powis said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need. If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up to date with whooping cough or other \u00advaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible.\"\n\nBath University's Professor Andrew Preston, who has investigated the bacteria that cause whooping cough, added: \"It is extremely sad news to hear of the deaths of five babies, especially from a vaccine-preventable disease. While no vaccine is perfect, pertussis vaccination of mums during pregnancy and of infants protects the babies and infants who are the most vulnerable to this serious and \u00adsometimes fatal disease.\n\n\"Vaccination rates in infants have declined compared to \u00adpre-pandemic levels. Uptake of the maternal booster also dropped. This results in many more young babies and infants \u00adsusceptible to infection. It is tragic to see babies dying and with cases on the rise it is vital for vaccination rates to recover.\"\n\nRoyal College of GPs chair Professor Kamila Hawthorne said: \"We would urge all parents to check their children's vaccinations, and their own, are up to date, and if they're not, to make an appointment as soon as possible. It is also important for pregnant mothers to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if they have not been immunised.\n\n\"If you, or a member of your family, does exhibit symptoms of whooping cough, especially a heavy wheezing cough that disrupts sleep, or a change in the colour of the face, then seek medical assistance.\"\n\nEmerging infectious diseases expert Professor Paul Hunter, of the World Health Organisation and the University of East Anglia, said: \"This current year looks like we may be seeing more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years. The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some who are.\n\n\"However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old. It is this group that are most at risk of death and longer-term \u00adproblems such as brain damage.\" Consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam added: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nNot all babies make the whooping sound when coughing, making the disease harder to spot. Other symptoms include coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. They could be followed by difficulty in breathing.\n\nThe last peak year in 2016 had 5,949 cases in England but health chiefs fear this year will be worse. In the first three months of 2024 there have been 2,793 cases.\n\nProf Hunter said other factors making the UK vulnerable includes the fact children unvaccinated by their parents due to the MMR jab scare sparked by discredited academic Andrew Wakefield are now in their early 20s and could drive population spread.\n\nSince the whooping cough pregnancy vaccine was introduced in 2013 there have been 26 deaths in babies too young to be protected by infant jabs. Half of cases so far this year have been under 15, with the highest rates in those under three months.\n\nMy month-old girl spent 10 days in coma Kerry Pearson, 26, with her daughter Baby Polly Deehy She is now awake and breathing independently\n\nA mum whose month-old girl spent 10 days in a coma with whooping cough is urging pregnant women to have the jab. Polly Deehy had a rattly cough and laboured breathing at two weeks. After four days coughing at home last month she suddenly turned blue and parents Kerry Pearson, 26 and Jack Deehy, 29, rushed her to Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent.\n\nShe got worse and was moved to St Mary's Hospital in London where she was diagnosed with the condition and put on a ventilator. Polly is now awake and breathing independently.\n\nKerry said: \"I've never been more relieved. It was the best thing ever. There's no evidence of any lasting problems, but she might have a bit of weakness in her lungs. Time will tell. I just want people to be aware. You should have the whooping cough vaccine when you're pregnant. If you're not offered it then please demand it.\"\n\nOne-month-old Rosie Robson spent two weeks in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary\n\nThis was echoed by Molly Pickering, 25, of Co Durham, whose one-month-old Rosie Robson had two weeks in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, including time in intensive care, with the condition. Molly said she recalled being offered the vaccine while pregnant but did not think there was enough information about how awful the illness can be. She said: \"At the hospital, the woman who was looking after Rosie said they had seen nothing like this [the number of whooping cough cases].\"\n\nWhooping cough Q&A\n\nQ What should we look out for?\n\nA The UKHSA says the first signs of whooping cough infection are similar to a cold such as a runny\n\nnose and sore throat. However, after about a week, it can develop into coughing bouts lasting minutes that are worse at night. These rapid, violent and uncontrolled coughing fits can last for 10 weeks.\n\nYoung babies may make a distinctive \"whoop\" - a gasp for breath between coughs. Some babies do not cough but turn blue or struggle to breathe. And some sufferers bring up a thick mucus, which can make them vomit.\n\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England Medical Director, said: \"If you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\" Anyone diagnosed with whooping cough should stay home and not attend work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics.\n\nQ Why is whooping cough so bad?\n\nA Whooping cough spreads because patients with it can be infectious of up to three weeks. It is also known as the \"100-day cough\" because of how long it can take to recover from.\n\nHalf of cases this year have been in the under-15s, with the highest rates in babies under three months of age, for whom it is particularly dangerous. The NHS says babies under six months are at increased risk of dehydration, breathing difficulties, pneumonia and seizures.\n\nQ What is causing the current UK outbreak?\n\nA Whooping cough is a cyclical disease which peaks every three to five years. Infections have surged since December 2023. The last big increase was in 2016 before the pandemic reduced social contacts so we are due a bounce back.\n\nVaccination uptake fell with rates among pregnant women down from more than 70% in 2017 to 58% in 2023. The number of two-year-olds who completed their routine six-in-one vaccinations, which includes protection against whooping cough, was 92.9% in 2023 compared with 96.3% in 2014.\n\nQ Who can get vaccinated and when?\n\nAThe NHS recommends pregnant women are vaccinated between 16 and 32 weeks. Immunity from the jab passes through the placenta to protect babies in their first weeks. When a baby is eight weeks old, they are offered the six-in-one vaccine which protects against whooping cough. More doses are offered at 12 and 16 weeks with a booster after three years.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_bagot@mirror.co.uk",

The bacterial infection, also known as pertussis, affects the lungs and breathing tubes.\n\nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) has issued an appeal after a 'significant' rise in cases in Northern Ireland. There have been 769 confirmed cases of whooping cough to date in Northern Ireland compared with just two between 2021 and 2023.\n\nThe PHA is urging pregnant woman and the parents of young children to book an appointment for the pertussis vaccine.\n\nNumbers do tend to go up every few years, and it's believed the rise in social contact following the pandemic is playing a part right now.\n\nSo, what makes whooping cough different from regular coughs, and what do you need to know?\n\nWhile many coughs are caused by the common cold virus, whooping cough is a bacterial infection (known medically as pertussis)\n\nThe bacterial infection, also known as pertussis, affects the lungs and breathing tubes. Whooping cough is sometimes called the '100-day cough' because of how long it can take to recover from it, and it spreads very easily.\n\nThe first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold and can include a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night.\n\nYoung babies may also make a distinctive \"whoop\" or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise.\n\n\"Whooping cough often appears as a normal cough or cold at first, however you may notice symptoms intensifying after a week or two,\" says Dr Kathryn Basford from online doctor, Zava. \"While a typical cough clears up in a few weeks and feels mild, whooping cough can linger for much longer, even up to a few months.\n\n\"The key difference to look out for between a mild cough and whooping cough is the intensity. Whooping cough comes in strong coughing fits, especially at night, and most notably includes a high-pitched 'whoop' as you struggle to breathe. It can even lead to vomiting, a bright red face, and difficulty breathing.\n\n\"And unlike a regular cough, whooping cough is much more contagious. If you haven't received a vaccination for whooping cough, it's definitely worth seeing a doctor to explore getting one. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and spreading.\"\n\n\"Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory illness, meaning it spreads through the air via tiny droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled by others nearby,\" says Basford.\n\n\"Additionally, the bacteria can linger on surfaces touched by an infected individual, creating indirect transmission if someone else touches the surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. This is why frequent hand washing and maintaining good respiratory hygiene, like covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, are crucial in preventing the spread.\"\n\nBasford explains: \"While whooping cough is most commonly associated with young children, it is still possible for adults to catch it. Adults typically experience milder symptoms than children.\"\n\n\"Whooping cough can definitely be serious, especially for young babies who haven't yet been vaccinated. Younger children especially can struggle to breathe during coughing fits, leading to complications like pneumonia and in some rarer, more severe cases, death,\" Basford cautions. \"Even in adults, the constant coughing can be debilitating, causing sleep problems and making daily activities tough.\"\n\nThere is a whooping cough vaccine. Dr Basford says: \"The best way to avoid a serious whooping cough is with vaccination - the vaccine is included in the routine NHS vaccination schedule and is given to babies and then as part of the pre-school boosters. Pregnant women should also receive the vaccination to protect their baby once it is born; this is given between 16 and 32 weeks.\"\n\n\"Treating whooping cough depends on a few factors, like your age and how long you've had it. Infants under six months are at greater risk of complications and often require hospitalisation and specific care,\" says Basford.\n\n\"If you're diagnosed early (within three weeks), antibiotics can help. Medication won't necessarily make you feel better faster, but it plays a crucial role in stopping the spread. However, if it's been over three weeks, antibiotics may not help as much as you're likely to no longer be contagious.\n\n\"The focus is on managing symptoms: getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using a cool mist humidifier to ease the cough. Painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol can also help with discomfort.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pertussis vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Agency_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Health Agency of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/LWYFC222PNKWTDH4P7IPFZYZQM.jpg?smart=true&auth=24de8bee32f084aa365927c5eb07141c4b4e7e1ede7c346693077fa61c4650be&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

How can you treat it? And how does it differ from a cold?\n\nHere MailOnline explains everything you need to know about the infection.\n\nHealth officials warned that the infection is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, as the first signs are a runny nose and sore throat. But around a week later, sufferers may develop coughing bouts that last minutes, struggle to breathe after coughing and make a 'whoop' sound between coughs. Other signs of whooping cough include bringing up a thick mucus that can cause vomiting and becoming red in the face\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nKnown medically as pertussis, the bacterial chest infection commonly progresses through three stages -- with the first largely similar to the common cold.\n\nSufferers can then be left with a chronic cough that remains for several weeks.\n\nExperts recommend anyone with a persistent cough which has lasted for more than two weeks should see a doctor.\n\nDr Safia Debar, executive health GP at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London, said: 'Particularly if you also have symptoms like lethargy and fever, or you've been in contact with somebody with whooping cough, then definitely seek medical attention.'\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: 'Whooping cough can have a very long infectious period of around two to three weeks -- the period of time when an infected individual is able to transmit the bacteria onto others.\n\n'Thus, there may be plenty of opportunities for people to mix, transmission to occur, and for there to be an infection of a vulnerable individual, such as a baby.'\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nHealth officials warned the infection is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, with the first signs typically being a runny nose and sore throat.\n\nBut around a week later, sufferers may develop coughing bouts which last minutes, struggle to breathe after coughing and make a 'whoop' sound between coughs.\n\nOther signs of pertussis, as it is medically known, include bringing up a thick mucus that can cause vomiting.\n\nYoung children may turn blue or grey due to difficulty breathing while adults might become red in the face.\n\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) bosses received 1,319 lab-confirmed reports of cases in England in March alone. It marks a 44-fold rise on the 30 logged over the same month in 2023 and comes after MailOnline earlier this year revealed that cases of the '100 day cough' were at a decade high\n\nOver half (50.8 per cent) were among those aged 15 and older, with more than a quarter (28.6 per cent) in children aged 10 to 14. But the rates of whooping cough remained highest in babies under three months, UKHSA noted, with 108 cases\n\nMost children under six months require hospitalisation after contracting whooping cough due to the risks of brain swelling and convulsions.\n\nBetween one to three per cent of those under three months die from the illness.\n\nIn teenagers and adults, serious cases of whooping cough can lead to pneumonia, fainting and even rib fractures due to the intensity of the coughing fits.\n\nHow do you treat whooping cough?\n\nDoctors will typically do a throat swab to see whether someone is infected with the Bordetella pertussis bacterium.\n\nRead More Five babies die in terrifying whooping cough outbreak with cases in 2024 already three times higher than whole of last year in post-Covid boom\n\nThey are able to dish out antibiotics as treatment if the whooping cough is detected within three weeks.\n\nHowever, if a person has been infected for longer, antibiotics will not speed up their recovery.\n\nMedics recommend focusing on managing symptoms by getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using a cool mist humidifier to ease the cough.\n\nPainkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol can also help with discomfort.\n\nCan it be prevented?\n\nBecause whooping cough is so infectious, experts recommend self-isolating for at least five days while antibiotic treatment kicks in, if you suspect you have the illness.\n\nThe most effective preventable measure, however, is to get vaccinated.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe 6-in-1 vaccine, given to babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks, and the 4-in-1 pre-school booster, administered to children aged three years and four months, is vital for protecting against catching whooping cough.\n\nPregnant women are also encouraged to get the vaccine to protect their baby from catching the infection in the first few weeks of their life.\n\nHowever, uptake of the 6-in-1 vaccine dropped to a record low of 92.6 per cent in 2023, while the 4-in-1 jab hit 83.3, also the lowest level ever logged, according to NHS England data going back to 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, just 61.5 per cent of expectant mothers had the whooping cough jab in 2022 -- the smallest number in seven years.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe figure is even lower in London (41.4 per cent).\n\nHow is it different to a cold?\n\nWhooping cough is similar to other kinds of respiratory illness in the early stages.\n\nDr Head said: 'You'll have some kind of cough, and perhaps a runny nose or a fever. It is very, very hard to tell the difference at that stage between whooping cough and anything else.\n\n'You can only really notice it's whooping cough later on in the presentation when that distinctive 'hoop' sound kicks in'.\n\nGiven not everyone experiences this symptom, the illness is difficult to accurately diagnose without laboratory testing, he added.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n'That's another reason why it is hard to get outbreaks under control and why vaccination is vital,' he said.\n\nSurveillance statistics show 2,793 lab-confirmed cases have been

It is usually self-limiting but can cause severe illness and death, particularly in young unimmunised children.\n\n\"The infection is spread by respiratory droplets, either directly between people or through contaminated items. Babies under one year of age are most at risk from whooping cough.\n\n\"Whooping cough can be prevented with immunisation which is given to infants, younger children and pregnant women. The whooping cough vaccine is offered to pregnant women to help protect their baby against the infection.\n\n\"Getting immunised during pregnancy is the best way to protect the baby in the first few vulnerable weeks of their life until they're old enough to have the routine immunisation at eight weeks of age.\"\n\nAn increase in laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases was observed in Scotland in late 2023.\n\nOf the 73 cases reported in 2023, the majority were reported in the final quarter of the year.\n\nFor comparison, in 2022 and 2021 there were three and four cases of pertussis reported, respectively. This is a considerable decline from the 198 cases reported in 2020 and 746 cases reported in 2019.\n\nUKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages, but for very young babies it can be extremely serious.\n\n\"Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nIn March alone, 1,319 cases were reported in England, according to the UKHSA's provisional data.\n\n\"During this quarter, while most cases (50.8 per cent, 1420) were in those aged 15 years or older who usually get a mild illness, the rates of whooping cough remain highest in babies under 3 months of age,\" a release from UKHSA reads.\n\n\"Whooping cough cases have been rising across England, as well as in many other countries, since December 2023 due to a combination of factors. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every 3 to 5 years.\n\n\"The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016. However, in common with other diseases, cases fell to very low numbers during the pandemic due to restrictions and public behaviours. A peak year is therefore overdue. The impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_anderson@scotsman.com", "name": "Joseph Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_droplet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory droplet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-limiting_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-limiting (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Infant_and_Toddlers", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Infant and Toddlers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Children", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Children", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjU1YTYyNDNkLTk2YjgtNDllYy05ZGI4LTY5MTJjZDcxZjkyOToyNTgwMzVlOS00YjYwLTRmMmMtOTRlYS1hZjA5NTJlMzQ5Mzk=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

This is compared with the 858 cases for the whole of 2023.\n\nBetween July and the end of November 2023, there were 1,141 suspected cases of whooping cough in England and Wales, as reported by clinicians, nearly 700 more than the equivalent timeframes in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe disease has spread across Europe. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that the bloc had seen more cases in the first three months of 2024 than an average year between 2012 and 2019.\n\nIt confirmed on Wednesday there had been 11 infant deaths and eight deaths among older adults on the continent.\n\nSo what is going on?\n\nWhooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every 3-5 years. The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016, with a major outbreak last seen in 2012.\n\nHealth officials said that the current deadly outbreak is \"overdue\" following suppression of the spread of disease during the pandemic due to lockdown and other restrictions.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said \"the impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population\".\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nThe name is given to a bacterial chest infection which can last for up to 100 days. \"It's highly contagious and it's spread via respiratory droplets,\" says Dr Safia Debar, executive health GP at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.\n\nThe illness progresses through three stages, the first being largely similar to a common cold with symptoms such as a runny nose, sore eyes and sneezing. After two weeks, infected individuals begin to develop bouts of intense coughing which can last for several minutes, sometimes followed by an audible whoop or gasp for breath between coughs. Young children may turn blue or grey due to difficulty breathing while adults might become red in the face.\n\nSufferers can then be left with a chronic cough which remains for several weeks.\n\nDebar recommends that anyone with a persistent cough which has lasted for more than two weeks, should see a doctor.\n\n\"Particularly if you also have symptoms like lethargy and fever, or you've been in contact with somebody with whooping cough, then definitely seek medical attention,\" she says. \"Without treatment, people are infectious for three weeks, but with antibiotics, you're not infectious after five days.\"\n\nHow serious is whooping cough?\n\nThe illness is most dangerous to newborn babies and infants. Most children under six months require hospitalisation after contracting whooping cough due to the risks of brain swelling and convulsions, and 1-3 per cent of those under three months die from the illness.\n\n\"Babies are vulnerable because their immune systems haven't fully developed,\" explains Dr Dipender Gill, a medical doctor and researcher at Imperial College London. \"It's quite prevalent in school-aged children as well, so those who are 11 to 18 years old.\"\n\nIn teenagers and adults, serious cases of whooping cough can lead to pneumonia, fainting and even rib fractures due to the intensity of the coughing fits. However, Gill says it tends to be the elderly and those with compromised immune systems who are most vulnerable.\n\n\"The whole population is susceptible to getting the infection,\" says Gill. \"But I think it can lead to particularly severe symptoms in elderly people, because as you age, your immune system becomes more impaired or if your immune system was impaired for other reasons such as cancer treatment or transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n\nHow can you protect yourself and others?\n\nBecause whooping cough is so infectious, Debar recommends self-isolating if your doctor suspects that you have the illness, at least for five days while antibiotic treatment kicks in.\n\nHowever, the most effective preventable measure is to get vaccinated. Babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks old are eligible for an immunisation to whooping cough on the NHS along with other vaccines. An additional booster shot can be given when the child is three.\n\nExperts are particularly keen to raise awareness that the whooping cough vaccine is now recommended for pregnant women.\n\n\"Newborns and babies in the first few months of life are more likely to get severe disease, [and] this is almost entirely preventable if the mother is vaccinated in pregnancy and her protective antibodies can then reach the baby through the placenta, and protect [it] until the baby gets its own vaccines,\" says Beate Kampmann, professor of paediatric infection & immunity at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nKampmann recommends checking your vaccine records in case you missed receiving this jab. It is also possible for concerned older individuals to receive a booster vaccine for whooping cough.\n\nHow is it treated?\n\nDebar says that doctors will typically do a throat swab to see whether someone is infected with the Bordetella pertussis bacterium and if so, prescribe antibiotics.\n\n\"Antibiotics are given on a case-by-case basis,\" she says. \"After the first three weeks, the infection tends to wane and sometimes if you're just left with the chronic cough, it could be that you do not need antibiotics.\"\n\nShe says that once any fever has passed, it's not necessary to remain in bed the whole time, and instead there are certain remedies which can be taken to try and alleviate the coughing.\n\n\"You want to strengthen your immune system,\" says Debar. \"Some people will use cough remedies, we find that they don't really work. But things like saline sprays can sometimes provide symptomatic relief. I love natural remedies, so ginger, turmeric, all things to strengthen immunity.\n\n\"The coughing can be worse at night so you want the environment around you to be as moist as possible. So, use a humidifier, make sure the temperature is appropriate, and make sure you're well hydrated. Maybe try an extra pillow if that helps.\"\n\nWhy is whooping cough more common now?\n\nThe last major outbreak in England was in 2012 when 14 deaths were reported in one year.\n\nSince then, vaccinations have been introduced, with all the deaths occurring in those too young for vaccination.\n\nThe whooping cough vaccine is routinely given as part of the: 6-in-1 vaccine - for babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks.\n\nIn 2012, vaccination of pregnant women was introduced, to protect the youngest babies. However, vaccination rates have been falling in recent years.\n\nExperts are concerned that the current outbreak is being fuelled by a combination of factors: vaccine hesitancy, suppression of disease linked to social distancing and reduced \"population immunity\" as a result.\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said the disease was much more common in the last century until vaccines were introduced\n\n\"This current year looks like we may see more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years,\" he said.\n\nProf Hunter said: \"The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some that are. However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old.\n\n\"It is this age group that is most at risk of death and developing longer-term problems such as brain damage.\n\n\"The problem is that this age group is too young for the vaccine in most circumstances.\n\n\"That is why we offer vaccines to pregnant women. Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life.\n\n\"Vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been falling quite markedly in recent years.\"", "source": {"uri":

Currently we are seeing an increase, so it is a timely reminder of the importance of vaccination.\n\n\"Young babies are at greatest risk of developing more serious disease, so it is very important that women take the offer of pertussis vaccine during each pregnancy so that their baby is protected against whooping cough after they are born, and that they continue that vaccination journey after their baby is born, getting them vaccinated, starting from when they are two months old as part of the childhood vaccination programme.\n\n\"The best time for women to get the vaccine is between 16 and 32 weeks of pregnancy, but vaccine can be beneficial even if given later.\n\n\"Whooping cough vaccines are given at GP practices so make sure to make an appointment to get it. If you have any questions about vaccination during pregnancy talk to your midwife or GP about the vaccines.\"\n\nThe whooping cough vaccine is also given as part of the childhood vaccination programme to children at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age and at aged 3 years 4 months.\n\nParents and guardians should ensure their children are vaccinated against whooping cough on time to continue their baby's protection through childhood.\n\nIf you are unsure if your child is up to date with vaccinations, the easiest way to check is to look at your child's red book or speak to your health visitor or GP practice.\n\nJust like we have seen with the MMR vaccine, which helps protect against measles, mumps and rubella, there has been a decrease in the percentage of children and pregnant women receiving the whooping cough vaccination.\n\nAll childhood vaccines provide the best protection for children against severe infections.\n\nIncreases in levels of the illness are usually seen every three to four years. Parents should be alert to the signs and symptoms of whooping cough, which include severe coughing fits accompanied by the characteristic 'whoop' sound in young children, and by a prolonged cough in older children or adults.\n\nIt is also advisable to keep babies away from anyone showing the signs or symptoms of whooping cough.\n\nWhooping cough can spread very easily. It is best to call your GP practice or GP Out of Hours service before you go in person. This will help to reduce it spreading to others. In an emergency, dial 999.\n\nFor further information on whooping cough and vaccinations visit www.pha.site/whooping-cough and www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/whooping-cough.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pertussis vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Agency_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Health Agency of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rubella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MMR vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Whooping cough comes in strong coughing fits, especially at night, and most notably includes a high-pitched 'whoop' as you struggle to breathe. It can even lead to vomiting, a bright red face, and difficulty breathing.\n\n\"And unlike a regular cough, whooping cough is much more contagious. If you haven't received a vaccination for whooping cough, it's definitely worth seeing a doctor to explore getting one. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and spreading.\"\n\n\"Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory illness, meaning it spreads through the air via tiny droplets expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled by others nearby,\" says Basford.\n\n\"Additionally, the bacteria can linger on surfaces touched by an infected individual, creating indirect transmission if someone else touches the surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. This is why frequent hand washing and maintaining good respiratory hygiene, like covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, are crucial in preventing the spread.\"\n\nBasford explains: \"While whooping cough is most commonly associated with young children, it is still possible for adults to catch it. Adults typically experience milder symptoms than children.\"\n\n\"Whooping cough can definitely be serious, especially for young babies who haven't yet been vaccinated. Younger children especially can struggle to breathe during coughing fits, leading to complications like pneumonia and in some rarer, more severe cases, death,\" Basford cautions. \"Even in adults, the constant coughing can be debilitating, causing sleep problems and making daily activities tough.\"\n\n\"The best way to avoid a serious whooping cough is with vaccination - the vaccine is included in the routine NHS vaccination schedule and is given to babies and then as part of the pre-school boosters. Pregnant women should also receive the vaccination to protect their baby once it is born; this is given between 16 and 32 weeks.\"\n\n\"Treating whooping cough depends on a few factors, like your age and how long you've had it. Infants under six months are at greater risk of complications and often require hospitalisation and specific care,\" says Basford.\n\n\"If you're diagnosed early (within three weeks), antibiotics can help. Medication won't necessarily make you feel better faster, but it plays a crucial role in stopping the spread. However, if it's been over three weeks, antibiotics may not help as much as you're likely to no longer be contagious.\n\n\"The focus is on managing symptoms: getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using a cool mist humidifier to ease the cough. Painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol can also help with discomfort.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hand washing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paracetamol"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/08/10/5d48be6c-e552-4f7f-b39b-25b8f254f83b.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

weeks, and this passes protection to their unborn child.\n\nAll babies are then given three doses of the 6 in 1 jab at eight, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases followed by a pre-school booster after children turn three.\n\nA surge in cases is also being reported in a number of other countries with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggesting this week that some nations may soon want to consider booster jabs for adults and older children.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency first warned last April that declining attendance rates for immunisation in England were becoming a concern, with the jab known to protect babies in their first few vulnerable weeks of life.\n\nOf the 1,468 cases confirmed between January and February 2024, around half were in those aged 15 years or older and 30% were in children aged between 10 and 14 years.\n\nDuring the first two months of the year there were 52 confirmed cases among babies under the age of three months.\n\nNHS National Medical Director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, added: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\"\n\nAnyone diagnosed with whooping cough is advised to stay at home and not go to work, nursery or school until 48 hours after starting antibiotics or three weeks after symptoms start if they

However, if a person has been infected for longer, antibiotics will not speed up their recovery.\n\nThe infection can be fatal, with up to 3 per cent of newborns dying from it, according to Professor Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious diseases from the University of East Anglia.\n\nAdditionally, most babies under six months with whooping cough are hospitalised with complications, such as dehydration, breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\n\nIt is less severe in older children and adults but can still cause sore ribs, a hernias, ear infections and urinary incontinence among these groups.\n\nThe 6-in-1 vaccine, given to babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks, and the 4-in-1 pre-school booster, administered to children aged three years and four months, is vital for protecting against catching whooping cough.\n\nPregnant women are also encouraged to get the vaccine to protect their baby from catching the infection in the first few weeks of their life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 6-in-1 vaccine, given to babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks, and the 4-in-1 pre-school booster, administered to children aged three years and four months, is vital for protecting against catching whooping cough.\n\nPregnant women are also encouraged to get the vaccine to protect their baby from catching the infection in the first few weeks of their life.\n\nParents have been urged to check their kids have had both jabs.\n\nWithout the jabs, experts warn people risk becoming seriously ill from the infection and passing it on to others.\n\nHowever, uptake of the 6-in-1 vaccine (92.6 per cent) and 4-in-1 jab (83.3 per cent) both slumped to all-time lows in 2023, according to NHS England data.\n\nMeanwhile, just 61.5 per cent of expectant mothers had the whooping cough jab in 2022 -- the smallest number in seven years.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, the UKHSA's consultant epidemiologist, said: 'Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.'\n\nShe added: 'Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\n'Pregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks.\n\n'This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.'\n\nMeanwhile, NHS national medical director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said: 'With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n'If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.'\n\nWhooping cough is caused by the pertussis bacteria and is spread by coughing and sneezing.\n\nDoctors dish out antibiotics as treatment if the whooping cough is detected within three weeks.\n\nHowever, if a person has been infected for longer, antibiotics will not speed up their recovery.\n\nPre-pandemic, between 2,500 and 4,500 suspected cases were logged each year. This fell to around 500 during the coronavirus crisis as social distancing curbed the spread of most bugs.\n\nBut cases hit 1,728 in 2023 because of the post-pandemic rebound, in a trend that experts say is down to lower societal immunity as a result of the Covid era. Similar trends were seen for bugs like flu and RSV.\n\nHowever, rates are still nowhere near the annual high of 170,000 logged in the 1940s. Routine vaccination against whooping cough in the 1950s dramatically slashed levels.\n\nHealth officials also acknowledged cases of whooping cough rise cyclically every few years. The last peak year -- 2016 -- logged 5,949 cases.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexavalent_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hexavalent vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hernia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of East Anglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urinary incontinence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Otitis media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/11/80498847-0-image-a-9_1715249789228.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

This follows 556 cases in January and 918 in February, bringing the total number of cases in 2024 to 2,793.\n\nSadly, in the first quarter of 2024 (January - March), there have been five infant deaths. Young infants are at highest risk of severe complications and death from whooping cough. Updated estimates of vaccine effectiveness in pregnancy shows high levels of protection (92%) against infant death.\n\nDuring this quarter, while most cases (50.8%, 1420) were in those aged 15 years or older who usually get a mild illness, the rates of whooping cough remain highest in babies under 3 months of age.\n\nWhooping cough cases have been rising across England, as well as in many other countries, since December 2023 due to a combination of factors. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every 3 to 5 years. The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016. However, in common with other diseases, cases fell to very low numbers during the pandemic due to restrictions and public behaviours. A peak year is therefore overdue. The impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population.\n\nUptake of vaccinations that protect against whooping cough have fallen in recent years across the country - in both the programme for pregnant women and the infant programme. Timely vaccination in pregnancy and in infancy are both important to protect vulnerable young babies from serious disease.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Consultant Epidemiologist at UK Health Security Agency, said:\n\nVaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\nPregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\nAll babies are given three doses of the 6 in 1 jab at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio with a pre-school booster offered at 3 years 4 months.\n\nWhooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\n\nNHS National Medical Director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said:\n\nWith cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\nIf you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\n\nWhooping cough, clinically known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection which affects the lungs. The first signs of infection are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. Young babies may also make a distinctive 'whoop' or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise which means whooping cough can be hard to recognise.\n\nIf anyone in your family is diagnosed with whooping cough, it's important they stay at home and do not go into work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics. This helps to prevent the spread of infection, especially to vulnerable groups, including infants. However, vaccination remains the best protection for babies and children.\n\n/Public Release.

Also called pertussis or whooping cough, it is a highly contagious respiratory infection. It was very common, and a major cause of infant mortality, until the introduction of vaccines to prevent it in the mid-20th century. Unlike other common respiratory infections, which are caused by viruses, whooping cough is caused by bacteria. Specifically, from the species Bordetella pertussis.\n\nWhat symptoms does it cause? Its most characteristic symptom is a persistent cough that can last after the infection has cleared and can last between two and three months. In its initial phase, after an incubation period of between one and two weeks, the symptoms resemble those of a common cold: nasal congestion, cough, sneezing, possible low-grade fever... Infants, the most vulnerable population group, can having difficulty breathing without coughing.\n\nHow is it spread? Contagion occurs through the air through droplets that an infected person emits when coughing, sneezing or even talking. A person can be infectious from the onset of symptoms until about four weeks after the onset of cough. After this period, you can no longer be contagious because you have already eliminated the bacteria from the body, although the cough persists.\n\nHow serious is it? In adults, the infection is usually bothersome but not serious and resolves within a few weeks. In children under one year of age who are not immunized, or incompletely immunized, it can cause pneumonia, seizures and brain damage. In this age group, whooping cough is fatal in one in every 300 cases, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Catalonia, 22 people have been hospitalized for whooping cough in the first three months of the year, of which sixteen were under one year old, the Health Department has reported. Four have needed admission to the ICU.\n\nHow to protect young children? \"Vaccination is the best defense against whooping cough,\" declares Antoni Trilla, epidemiologist at the Hospital Cl\u00ednic in Barcelona. In Spain, the vaccination schedule provides for babies to receive three doses at 2, 4 and 11 months, and a fourth dose at six years. The pertussis immunogen is part of the DTPa vaccine, which also protects against tetanus and diphtheria. To protect newborns during the first weeks of life, pregnant women are advised to get vaccinated to transmit antibodies to the fetus through the placenta. \"It is the way to protect newborns against a serious disease against which, otherwise, they have no defense,\" says Trilla. In Spain, 88.5% of pregnant women were vaccinated in 2023, the highest rate recorded by the ECDC.\n\nDo you have treatment? Since it is an infection caused by bacteria, it is treated with antibiotics. For treatment to be effective, it should be started as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. Antibiotics are not recommended if the cough has started more than three weeks ago since, in that case, the body has most likely already eliminated the infection. There are no specific treatments for coughing fits from whooping cough.\n\nHow do I know if the cough I have is whooping cough? \"You can have a cough for many reasons and the majority of people who have a cough do not have whooping cough,\" reassures Antoni Trilla, from the Cl\u00ednic hospital. \"But if you have a recent cough that lasts for weeks, or if there has been a case of whooping cough in our environment and we start to have a cough, then it is advisable to consult a doctor or nurse.\"\n\nHow many cases are there now in Spain? It is impossible to know because the vast majority of cases go undiagnosed and unreported. According to ECDC data, 91 cases per million inhabitants have been registered in Spain in February 2024. This figure does not report on the real incidence of infection, but it allows us to compare the current situation with that of previous periods (it is the highest figure). high in recent years) and with that of surrounding countries (it is higher than those of Portugal, France, Italy or Germany). \"It is a very high number, it means that we have many cases,\" Trilla assesses.\n\nWhy are cases increasing? The incidence of whooping cough usually increases cyclically every three to five years. The phenomenon is attributed to the fact that the population's immunity drops after several years with few infections, which creates the conditions for the bacteria to re-emerge. The figures currently recorded in Europe are close to those recorded in 2016 and 2019. Since then, measures to prevent respiratory infections during the pandemic may have favored less transmission of whooping cough and a greater decline in herd immunity .\n\nWill infections decrease soon? \"It is an endemic disease that is transmitted throughout the year, but especially in spring and early summer,\" reports Fernando Moraga-Llop, from the Spanish Association of Vaccinology. Therefore, the current epidemic wave, which began in autumn 2023, is expected to continue for a few more weeks.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_pertussis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bordetella pertussis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasal congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incubation period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_72cb7.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Protection should last until they are old enough to get vaccinated themselves\n\nVaccination rates have also slumped in the wake of the pandemic in a trend experts blame on growing jab scepticism.\n\nDr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, today said: 'Whooping cough can and does kill babies.\n\n'A high coverage of vaccination is vital in reducing transmission within populations.\n\n'Vaccine uptake in young children and for expectant mothers during pregnancy is so important. The vaccine is safe, and extremely effective.'\n\nHe added: 'As a disease, whooping cough is as infectious as measles, and more infectious than Covid.\n\nA mother whose child died from whooping cough at just 32 days old urges action\n\nRiley Hughes was an otherwise healthy baby when he died from \u00adwhooping cough aged just 32 days in 2015.\n\nAt three weeks old, he'd \u00addeveloped a mild cold and \u00adoccasional cough. A doctor \u00adreassured his parents, Catherine and Greg, he was fine.\n\nBut Riley was sleepy and not waking for feeds, so they took him to hospital.\n\nHe was admitted and diagnosed with pertussis. His condition quickly deteriorated and he was put on life support.\n\nMs Hughes, from Perth Australia, told MailOnline: 'Riley was screaming and screaming. He would have been in a lot of pain from the needles and \u00adcannulas they were \u00adadministering.\n\n'That's how my baby will last remember the world.'\n\nShe said: 'Riley was placed in my arms -- I was shocked at how burning hot and swollen his tiny body was.\n\n'The tubes were removed, and we cuddled, cried, kissed him, and sang to him a lullaby as the life slowly drained out of him.\n\n'If I had been offered a \u00adwhooping cough booster during pregnancy, there is a good chance Riley would still be with us today.'\n\nBut when Ms Hughes was \u00adpregnant, it was before Australia offered the maternal pertussis vaccine.\n\nDays after Riley's death the vaccine programme began, resulting in a significant \u00adreduction in babies hospitalised with \u00adpertussis.\n\nMs Hughes, who now campaigns to encourage women to be vaccinated said: 'It's bittersweet -- I'm overjoyed that we have these \u00adfantastic \u00adpregnancy vaccination programmes, but really sad they weren't implemented in time for Riley.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This is in part due to a long period where the infected individual can be infectious, able to transmit the bacteria onto others.\n\n'Thus, with a larger pool of susceptible people, there is increased likelihood of an outbreak being sustained.'\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Andrew Preston, an expert in biology, from the University of Bath, said: 'Uptake of the maternal booster has dropped from a high of 70 per cent to under 60 per cent.\n\n'This results in many more young babies and infants susceptible to infection.\n\n'It is tragic to see babies dying from whooping cough and with cases on the rise it is vital for vaccination rates to recover.'\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, added: 'This current year looks like we may see more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years.'\n\nYounger children, particularly under the age of three months, are 'most at risk of death and developing longer term problems such as brain damage', he said.\n\n'The problem is that this age group is too young for the vaccine in most circumstances,' he added.\n\n'That is why we offer vaccine to pregnant women. Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life.'\n\nDozens of babies died each year before the pregnancy jab roll-out was introduced in England in 2012.\n\nOnly 21 fatalities were recorded between then and 2023. All but two of their mothers were unvaccinated.\n\nMailOnline understands of the five babies who have died in 2024 -- all under the age of three months -- two of their mothers were unvaccinated.\n\nUptake of the six-in-one jab -- offered to babies in their first couple months of life -- is also at an all-time low.\n\nJust 91.8 per cent were fully vaccinated by their 1st birthday in 2022/23, according to NHS figures.\n\nBabies are given three doses of the six-in-one jab at eight, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio.\n\nA pre-school booster is offered after they turn three.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, consultant epidemiologist at UK Health Security Agency, said: 'Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\n'Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious.\n\n'Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.'\n\nSir Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: 'With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n'If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.'\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nPolly Deehy had a rattly cough and laboured breathing when she was just two weeks old on April 6.

The last occurred in 2016, when almost 6,000 cases were confirmed.\n\nPre-pandemic, between 2,500 and 4,500 suspected cases were logged each year. This fell to around 500 during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nLockdowns stifled the spread of pathogens as people met less.\n\nUKHSA bosses said the impact of the Covid pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population.

reported this year to the end of March.\n\nOf these, 556 were logged in January, 918 in February and 1,319 in March.\n\nHalf (50.8 per cent) were among those aged 15 and older, with more than a quarter (28.6 per cent) in children aged 10 to 14.\n\nBut rates remained highest in babies under three months, who are most at risk.\n\nHowever, infection rates are still nowhere near the annual high of 170,000 logged in the 1940s.\n\nRoutine vaccination, introduced in the 1950s, dramatically slashed levels.\n\nWhooping cough is caused by the pertussis bacteria and is spread by coughing and sneezing.\n\nSufferers are infectious from around six days after cold-like symptoms begin to three weeks after their cough starts.\n\nDoctors dish out antibiotics as treatment if the whooping cough is detected within three weeks.\n\nHowever, if a person has been infected for longer, antibiotics will not speed up their recovery.\n\nWhooping cough is less severe in older children and adults but can

It primarily affects the respiratory system, leading to severe coughing spells that can make breathing difficult. The name \"whooping cough\" comes from the distinctive \"whooping\" sound made when the person gasps for air after a coughing fit.\n\nWhooping cough typically starts with symptoms similar to those of a common cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, mild cough, and low-grade fever. After about one to two weeks, the cough becomes more severe and is characterized by intense, rapid coughing spells that often end with a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound as the person tries to breathe in.\n\nIn infants and young children, whooping cough can be particularly dangerous and may lead to complications such as pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, or even death.

The impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population.\n\nUptake of vaccinations that protect against whooping cough have fallen in recent years across the country - in both the programme for pregnant women and the infant programme. Timely vaccination in pregnancy and in infancy are both important to protect vulnerable young babies from serious disease.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Consultant Epidemiologist at UK Health Security Agency, said:\n\nVaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\nPregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\nAll babies are given three doses of the 6 in 1 jab at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio with a pre-school booster offered at 3 years 4 months.\n\nWhooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\n\nNHS National Medical Director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said:\n\nWith cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\nIf you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\n\nWhooping cough, clinically known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection which affects the lungs. The first signs of infection are similar to a cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat, but after about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. Young babies may also make a distinctive 'whoop' or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing, though not all babies make this noise which means whooping cough can be hard to recognise.\n\nIf anyone in your family is diagnosed with whooping cough, it's important they stay at home and do not go into work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or 3 weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics. This helps to prevent the spread of infection, especially to vulnerable groups, including infants. However, vaccination remains the best protection for babies and children.", "source": {"uri": "gov.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "gov.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-03837e1cec82f217cf32514635a13c879b8c400ae3b1c207c5744411658c7635.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Spike in cases prompts warning from Lane County health experts", "body": "Whooping cough is the common name for pertussis, a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a bacteria. It is usually treated with antibiotics.\n\nLane County health officials are warning residents about a recent uptick in pertussis, also known as whooping cough, after 13 cases were reported in April.\n\nAccording to Lane County Public Health, recent cases indicate community spread of the highly contagious respiratory infection.\n\nHealth officials recommend people stay up to date on pertussis vaccinations.\n\n\"This is very important for infants, young children, those with underlying medical conditions and their close contacts,\" Lane County said in statement. \"We want to protect these vulnerable groups who are more likely to develop severe whooping cough.\"\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nWhooping cough is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria that can cause severe coughing fits followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound when breathing in. The cough can last for up to 10 weeks or more.\n\nSome infants who have pertussis may not cough at all but instead have apnea or struggles with breathing.\n\nVomiting and exhaustion also are symptoms of pertussis, which can lead to serious complications, especially for infants, according to Lane County Public Health. Other complications include pneumonia, dehydration, seizures and brain damage.\n\nOregon sees a decline in vaccination rates\n\nLane County Health officials said vaccination rates have been declining statewide since the pandemic, which increases the risk for continued spread of diseases in the community.\n\nThe pertussis vaccines are known as DTaP, which stands for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; as well as Tdap, which is a similar vaccine but for adolescents and adults.\n\nAccording to data from the Oregon Immunization Program, 93.9 percent of kindergarten students in Lane County were vaccinated for DTaP in 2022, while 91.5 percent of kindergarten students received the vaccine in 2023.\n\nThere also was a decline in complete vaccination rates for kindergarten-aged students in Lane County from 92.1 percent in 2022 to 88.3 percent in 2023.\n\nComplete vaccinations include DTaP, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, MMR (1st dose of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella), 2nd dose of Measles, Polio and Varicella.\n\nDTaP and Tdap vaccination rates in Lane County for K-12 students during the 2022-2023 academic year were on par with the Oregon state average of 93.9 percent.\n\nComplete immunization rates in Lane County were higher than the state average at 92.3 percent, compared to Oregon's 91.8 percent. Of the K-12 student population in Lane County, 6.6 percent of students had a nonmedical exemption from any school-required vaccine.\n\nPertussis cases rise across Oregon\n\nAs of April 14, the Oregon Health Authority reported a significant rise in Pertussis cases. Year-to-date case counts in Oregon, from January to March of 2024, shows at least 60 cases of pertussis statewide. In comparison, 2022 saw at least 17 cases of pertussis within the same time frame.\n\nPertussis cases reported so far in 2024 are the highest recorded since 2020, where at least 145 cases were recorded from January to March of that year.\n\nHow to get vaccinated for whooping cough\n\nAccording to Lane County health officials, pertussis vaccinations can usually be obtained from a primary care provider such as a pediatrician, family physician, internal medicine physician or nurse practitioner.\n\nResidents who do not have a primary care provider can contact a pharmacy or their health plan to review vaccination options, while people without insurance can contact a federally qualified health center to review their vaccine options.\n\nIf your child is experiencing symptoms of pertussis such as runny nose, fever and violent coughing, residents are advised to see a doctor as soon as possible, said Lane County Public Health. If your child is struggling to breathe or is turning blue or purple, call 9-1-1 immediately.\n\nLane County recommends infants and children complete a series of DTaP doses, while adolescents receive one dose of Tdap. Women who are in their third trimester of pregnancy also are referred to the Tdap dose to help protect their babies early in life.\n\nParents who are hesitant about the pertussis vaccine are encouraged to talk with their child's health care providers to discuss their concerns.\n\nBacteria spread and prevention\n\nIf you are diagnosed with pertussis, Lane County officials recommend you take antibiotics as prescribed and avoid contact with others until you are no longer contagious, which can last for up to three weeks after coughing fits begin.\n\nLane County Public Health recommends the following tips to prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause pertussis and other respiratory illnesses:", "source": {"uri": "eu.registerguard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Register-Guard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_County,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lane County, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lane County, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apnea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pertussis vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hepatitis A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hepatitis B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chickenpox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2022/08/15/USATODAY/usatsports/imageForEntry2-PJS.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-14", "textStart": 2726, "textEnd": 2734}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life.\n\n\"Vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been falling quite markedly in recent years.\"\n\nOf the 1,468 cases confirmed between January and February 2024, around half were in those aged 15 years or older and 30% were in children aged between 10 and 14 years.\n\nDuring the first two months of the year there were 52 confirmed cases among babies under the age of three months - who are at highest risk of serious complications.\n\nDr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \"A drop in vaccination coverage will be a key factor contributing to this rise in cases of whooping cough.\n\n\"It's vital that vulnerable groups such as babies and pregnant women are up to date with their recommended immunisations, and that includes the pertussis vaccine.\n\n\"Whooping cough can be a very severe infection, potentially fatal to babies who become infected.\n\n\"Outbreaks can occur in cycles, so we tend to see these rises in cases every few years.\n\n\"The reasons for that are not fully understood, but population-level waning immunity is likely to contribute to that, hence why a high coverage of vaccination is so important.\n\n\"As a disease, whooping cough is as infectious as measles, and more infectious than Covid-19.\n\n\"This is in part due to a long period where the infected individual can be infectious, i.e. able to transmit the bacteria on to others.\n\n\"Thus, with a larger pool of susceptible people, there is increased likelihood of an outbreak being sustained.\"\n\nThe NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against whooping cough between 16 and 32 weeks.\n\nImmunity from the jab passes through the placenta to protect newborn babies in their first weeks of life.\n\nWhen a baby is eight weeks old they are offered the six-in-one vaccine, which includes immunisation against whooping cough.\n\nThe second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks.\n\nWhen children are three years and four months they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis.", "source": {"uri": "ireland-live.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "ireland-live.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough",

Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life.\n\nWhooping cough can be a very severe infection, potentially fatal to babies who become infected Dr Michael Head, University of Southampton\n\n\"Vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been falling quite markedly in recent years.\"\n\nOf the 1,468 cases confirmed between January and February 2024, around half were in those aged 15 years or older and 30% were in children aged between 10 and 14 years.\n\nDuring the first two months of the year there were 52 confirmed cases among babies under the age of three months - who are at highest risk of serious complications.\n\nDr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \"A drop in vaccination coverage will be a key factor contributing to this rise in cases of whooping cough.\n\n\"It's vital that vulnerable groups such as babies and pregnant women are up to date with their recommended immunisations, and that includes the pertussis vaccine.\n\n\"Whooping cough can be a very severe infection, potentially fatal to babies who become infected.\n\n\"Outbreaks can occur in cycles, so we tend to see these rises in cases every few years.\n\n\"The reasons for that are not fully understood, but population-level waning immunity is likely to contribute to that, hence why a high coverage of vaccination is so important.\n\n\"As a disease, whooping cough is as infectious as measles, and more infectious than Covid-19.\n\n\"This is in part due to a long period where the infected individual can be infectious, i.e. able to transmit the bacteria on to others.\n\n\"Thus, with a larger pool of susceptible people, there is increased likelihood of an outbreak being sustained.\"\n\nThe NHS recommends all pregnant women are vaccinated against whooping cough between 16 and 32 weeks.\n\nImmunity from the jab passes through the placenta to protect newborn babies in their first weeks of life.\n\nWhen a baby is eight weeks old they are offered the six-in-one vaccine, which includes immunisation against whooping cough.\n\nThe second dose of the vaccine is offered at 12 weeks and the third is offered at 16 weeks.\n\nWhen children are three years and four months they will be offered the four-in-one pre-school booster, which protects against pertussis.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

The worrying new figures released by the UK Heath Secutiry Agency (UKHSA) show there were 2,793 cases reported to the end of March of march. This is compared with the 858 cases for the whole of 2023. The UKHSA confirmed that between January and the end of March, there have also been five infant deaths.\n\nDuring this three month period while most cases (50.8%, 1420) were in those aged 15 years or older who usually get a mild illness, the rates of whooping cough remain highest in babies under 3 months of age. In January and February, there were 52 cases of babies under three months being diagnosed with pertussis, compared to only 48 cases last year. Typically parents are offered early immunisations for their baby when they are eight weeks old with further doses at the 12 and 16-month mark.\n\nUKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam said: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nDr Amirthalingam continued, saying vaccination remains the best form of defence against the Victorian-era disease. He explained: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\n\n\"Pregnant women are offered a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\n\"All babies are given three doses of the 6 in 1 jab at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio with a pre-school booster offered at 3 years 4 months. Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nThe uptake of vaccinations that protect against whooping cough have fallen in recent years across the country - in both the programme for pregnant women and the infant programme. Timely vaccination in pregnancy and in infancy are both important to protect vulnerable young babies from serious disease.\n\nSpeaking of the latest numbers, NHS National Medical Director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\"\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

This is compared with the 858 cases for the whole of 2023.\n\nBetween July and the end of November 2023, there were 1,141 suspected cases of whooping cough in England and Wales, as reported by clinicians, nearly 700 more than the equivalent timeframes in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe disease has spread across Europe. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that the bloc had seen more cases in the first three months of 2024 than an average year between 2012 and 2019.\n\nIt confirmed on Wednesday there had been 11 infant deaths and eight deaths among older adults on the continent.\n\nWhooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every 3-5 years. The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016, with a major outbreak last seen in 2012.\n\nHealth officials said that the current deadly outbreak is \"overdue\" following suppression of the spread of disease during the pandemic due to lockdown and other restrictions.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said \"the impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population\".\n\nThe name is given to a bacterial chest infection which can last for up to 100 days. \"It's highly contagious and it's spread via respiratory droplets,\" says Dr Safia Debar, executive health GP at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.\n\nThe illness progresses through three stages, the first being largely similar to a common cold with symptoms such as a runny nose, sore eyes and sneezing. After two weeks, infected individuals begin to develop bouts of intense coughing which can last for several minutes, sometimes followed by an audible whoop or gasp for breath between coughs. Young children may turn blue or grey due to difficulty breathing while adults might become red in the face.\n\nSufferers can then be left with a chronic cough which remains for several weeks.\n\nDebar recommends that anyone with a persistent cough which has lasted for more than two weeks, should see a doctor.\n\n\"Particularly if you also have symptoms like lethargy and fever, or you've been in contact with somebody with whooping cough, then definitely seek medical attention,\" she says. \"Without treatment, people are infectious for three weeks, but with antibiotics, you're not infectious after five days.\"\n\nThe illness is most dangerous to newborn babies and infants. Most children under six months require hospitalisation after contracting whooping cough due to the risks of brain swelling and convulsions, and 1-3 per cent of those under three months die from the illness.\n\n\"Babies are vulnerable because their immune systems haven't fully developed,\" explains Dr Dipender Gill, a medical doctor and researcher at Imperial College London. \"It's quite prevalent in school-aged children as well, so those who are 11 to 18 years old.\"\n\nIn teenagers and adults, serious cases of whooping cough can lead to pneumonia, fainting and even rib fractures due to the intensity of the coughing fits. However, Gill says it tends to be the elderly and those with compromised immune systems who are most vulnerable.\n\n\"The whole population is susceptible to getting the infection,\" says Gill. \"But I think it can lead to particularly severe symptoms in elderly people, because as you age, your immune system becomes more impaired or if your immune system was impaired for other reasons such as cancer treatment or transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n\nBecause whooping cough is so infectious, Debar recommends self-isolating if your doctor suspects that you have the illness, at least for five days while antibiotic treatment kicks in.\n\nHowever, the most effective preventable measure is to get vaccinated. Babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks old are eligible for an immunisation to whooping cough on the NHS along with other vaccines. An additional booster shot can be given when the child is three.\n\nExperts are particularly keen to raise awareness that the whooping cough vaccine is now recommended for pregnant women.\n\n\"Newborns and babies in the first few months of life are more likely to get severe disease, [and] this is almost entirely preventable if the mother is vaccinated in pregnancy and her protective antibodies can then reach the baby through the placenta, and protect [it] until the baby gets its own vaccines,\" says Beate Kampmann, professor of paediatric infection & immunity at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nKampmann recommends checking your vaccine records in case you missed receiving this jab. It is also possible for concerned older individuals to receive a booster vaccine for whooping cough.\n\nDebar says that doctors will typically do a throat swab to see whether someone is infected with the Bordetella pertussis bacterium and if so, prescribe antibiotics.\n\n\"Antibiotics are given on a case-by-case basis,\" she says. \"After the first three weeks, the infection tends to wane and sometimes if you're just left with the chronic cough, it could be that you do not need antibiotics.\"\n\nShe says that once any fever has passed, it's not necessary to remain in bed the whole time, and instead there are certain remedies which can be taken to try and alleviate the coughing.\n\n\"You want to strengthen your immune system,\" says Debar. \"Some people will use cough remedies, we find that they don't really work. But things like saline sprays can sometimes provide symptomatic relief. I love natural remedies, so ginger, turmeric, all things to strengthen immunity.\n\n\"The coughing can be worse at night so you want the environment around you to be as moist as possible. So, use a humidifier, make sure the temperature is appropriate, and make sure you're well hydrated. Maybe try an extra pillow if that helps.\"\n\nThe last major outbreak in England was in 2012 when 14 deaths were reported in one year.\n\nSince then, vaccinations have been introduced, with all the deaths occurring in those too young for vaccination.\n\nThe whooping cough vaccine is routinely given as part of the: 6-in-1 vaccine - for babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks.\n\nIn 2012, vaccination of pregnant women was introduced, to protect the youngest babies. However, vaccination rates have been falling in recent years.\n\nExperts are concerned that the current outbreak is being fuelled by a combination of factors: vaccine hesitancy, suppression of disease linked to social distancing and reduced \"population immunity\" as a result.\n\nProfessor Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said the disease was much more common in the last century until vaccines were introduced\n\n\"This current year looks like we may see more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years,\" he said.\n\nProf Hunter said: \"The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some that are. However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old.\n\n\"It is this age group that is most at risk of death and developing longer-term problems such as brain damage.\n\n\"The problem is that this age group is too young for the vaccine in most circumstances.\n\n\"That is why we offer vaccines to pregnant women.

This is compared with the 858 cases for the whole of 2023.\n\nThe UKHSA said that between January and the end of March, there have been five infant deaths. The deaths follow warnings that cases of whooping cough could reach a 40-year high in 2024.\n\nIn March alone, some 1,319 cases were reported, according to the provisional data. The bacterial infection, also known as pertussis, affects the lungs and breathing tubes.\n\nWhooping cough can be called the \"100-day cough\" because of how long it can take to recover from it, and it spreads very easily.\n\nDr Gayatri Amirthalingam, the UKHSA consultant epidemiologist, said: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious.\n\n\"Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nOver the last 11 years there have been 26 deaths of babies from whooping cough. The last major outbreak was in 2012 when 14 deaths were reported in one year.\n\nSince then vaccinations have been introduced, with all the deaths since occurring in those too young to be vaccinated.\n\nPaul Hunter, the professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: \"For most adults the whooping cough is not life threatening, though can be very unpleasant.\n\n\"This is a chronic repeated bout of coughing which can be so bad that people feel it a struggle to breathe in again.\n\n\"It used to be much more common in the last century up until the vaccine was introduced. However, this current year looks like we may see more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years.\"\n\nProf Hunter said that a number of factors could be behind the rise in cases, including: a drop in vaccine uptake; reduced \"population immunity\" as a result of a fall in cases linked to social distancing measures during the pandemic; and a \"scare over vaccines\" in the early 2000s, which led to a group of people aged around 21 who did not complete their vaccination.\n\nHe added: \"The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some that are.\n\n\"However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old.\n\n\"It is this age group that are most at risk of death and developing longer-term problems such as brain damage. The problem is that this age group is too young for the vaccine in most circumstances.\n\n\"That is why we offer vaccine to pregnant women. Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life.\n\n\"Vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been falling quite markedly in recent years.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of East Anglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing_measures_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herd immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5.aYUxtVrkuLCnXK6muj6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/8e34f573c7f88329b1daca0a627eb4bc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, here's what you need to know about the contagious disease.\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nAlso known as pertussis, whooping cough is a highly contagious infection caused by the bacteria bordetella pertussis that affects the airways and lungs. It used to be called the \"100-day cough\" as symptoms can last for months if left untreated.\n\nWhat are symptoms?\n\nWhooping cough causes intense coughing fits that can even lead to choking or vomiting. Coughing can be so violent, that a \"whooping\" sound can be heard when someone tries to catch their breath.\n\nHow common is whooping cough?\n\nThe bacteria that causes the disease is found worldwide. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, there are 1,000 to 3,000 cases in the country each year, and 20 to 40 million cases globally.\n\nHow dangerous is it?\n\nWithout treatment, whooping cough can lead to brain damage and even death. It is most dangerous for children under the age of one, particularly those who are not fully vaccinated. There are an estimated 400,000 deaths worldwide each year.\n\nIs there a vaccine?\n\nYes. Children in Canada typically start receiving the whooping cough vaccine at two months of age. Children under six years old need five doses for full protection.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada urges anyone in regular contact with a baby to be immunized at least two weeks before seeing them. The vaccine's effectiveness fades over time, so a booster dose may be needed. Booster doses are also typically given during pregnancy between 27 and 32 weeks.\n\nHow is whooping cough tested and treated?\n\nWhooping cough can be detected through a lab test. All cases must be reported to local health authorities. Infections are usually treated with antibiotics.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Agency_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public Health Agency of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/8/whooping-cough-1-6878594-1715188149703.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It is a serious disease, especially in babies\", said the European Commissioner for Health in a statement.\n\nFurther, the commissioner stated that whooping cough continues to be a public health problem, as the disease is \"endemic in the EU/EEA and around the world and causes significant epidemics every three to five years, even in countries with high vaccination coverage\".\n\nThe European agency pointed out that the rise in cases is mainly due to a drop in vaccinations during the pandemic. However, it is urging people to take vaccination against whooping cough and also maintain proper sanitation and hygiene, including covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing and washing hands afterward.\n\n\"Vaccines against pertussis have proven to be safe and effective,\" said ECDC Director Andrea Ammon.\n\nWhooping cough is transmitted when the respiratory droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze are caught by a healthy person. Then, the bacteria attach themselves to the throat lining and produce toxins, causing inflammation in airways, coughing fits, and breathing problems.\n\nThe usual symptoms of whooping cough are runny nose, fever, vomiting, and exhaustion after uncontrollable and sudden coughing spells. Several adults experience complications like broken ribs from coughing, loss of bladder control, and fainting.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri":

Health Agency has urged parents to get their young children vaccinated amid a significant rise in cases of whooping cough in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe PHA said pregnant women should also take action after 769 cases of whooping cough were confirmed in the region so far this year, compared with just two between 2021 and 2023.\n\nThe PHA is urging families to book an appointment for the pertussis vaccine to help protect their children.\n\nLouise Flanagan, PHA consultant in public health, said whooping cough spreads very easily and can make babies and young children in particular very ill.\n\n\"It sadly can even be fatal in young babies or people with heath conditions,\" she said.\n\n\"However, the good news is that it can be prevented through vaccination, so it's really important that parents get their babies vaccinated against it as part of the childhood vaccination programme, and that pregnant women also get vaccinated, as this will help protect their unborn baby from getting whooping cough in the weeks after birth.\n\n\"Whooping cough is a disease that can cause long bouts of coughing and choking, which can make it hard to breathe.\n\n\"The evidence shows that babies born to vaccinated mothers are 90% less likely to get the disease than babies whose mothers were unvaccinated.\n\n\"Whooping cough tends to circulate in greater numbers in Northern Ireland every three to four years.\n\n\"Currently we are seeing an increase, so it is a timely reminder of the importance of vaccination.\"\n\nFive babies have died in England after being diagnosed with

It's called pertussis - 'whooping cough' or the '100-day cough', as it's known to most people - and cases are surging in the UK.\n\nWhile it's a very nasty infection if you contract it as a child or adult, for very small babies, it can be lethal.\n\nEarlier this week I wrote about how paediatric colleagues had told me babies were dying as a result of the infection, although the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had reported just one death in this cycle - at the end of 2023.\n\nBut today it has released data saying that five babies have died from whooping cough between the beginning of January and the end of March this year.\n\nThis brings the total to six baby deaths in this current cycle of whooping cough (which started last summer).\n\n'There are still no indications that cases have peaked in England and Wales, therefore the risk of infections is expected to remain elevated in the coming weeks,' Airfinity, a disease forecasting company, tells me.\n\nCatherine Hughes, from Perth, Australia, described how her otherwise healthy baby son Riley contracted whooping cough\n\nThe month-old died in hospital in 2015 after catching whooping cough\n\nCatherine Hughes said of her baby son: 'You never \"get over\" losing your child in this way and you never forget the terrifying sound of the cough that took your child's life'\n\nThere is inevitably a lag between deaths and official reported figures, so already, by mid-May, the number of deaths is thought to be higher. And with paediatric intensive care units now on 'surge capacity' because of pertussis and measles - which means, essentially, that there are many cases - that number may well, tragically, rise.\n\nEarlier this week I reported the harrowing words of Catherine Hughes, describing the death of her month-old son Riley in 2015 after the otherwise healthy baby had contracted whooping cough.\n\n'You never \"get over\" losing your child in this way and you never forget the terrifying sound of the cough that took your child's life,' the mother of two, from Perth, Australia, said to me.\n\nBabies should not be dying of this disease: there is a vaccine, offered to women who are between 16 and 32 weeks' pregnant, since the antibodies pass across the placenta and \u00adprotect the baby in the first few months of life. This maternal vaccine is 92 per cent effective in protecting newborn babies up until two months old, according to the UKHSA. After this age, the child is old enough to get the first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTP) as part of their vaccination programme.\n\nYet the uptake among pregnant women in the UK has fallen dramatically, from 74.7 per cent in 2017 to just 59.5 per cent in 2023. In parts of London it's as low as 36 per cent.\n\nAnd shockingly we're heading towards recording the same number of annual deaths we used to see before the maternal jab was introduced.\n\n'We are seeing case numbers at levels similar to what we saw in 2012, and this as at a time before we had a vaccination programme for pregnant women in place,' warns Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA.\n\nTo put this into perspective, in the 12 years prior to the introduction in 2012 of the maternal pertussis vaccination, every year there were around 63 deaths in babies aged under one year with confirmed pertussis.\n\nThen, for the whole 11-year period from 2013 to the end of March 2024, there were 26 of these tragic deaths in babies too young to be fully protected by infant vaccination. But six of them - nearly a fifth - have occurred in this current surge, up until March this year.\n\n'We now have a life-saving intervention - the maternal vaccine, and it's important that mothers take this and at the right time,' says Dr Amirthalingam.\n\nWhooping cough is considered so serious that, since 1940, it's been classed as a 'notifiable' disease - one of 34 diseases, mainly highly infectious ones, that need to be notified to official bodies such as the UKHSA (others include anthrax, leprosy and rabies).\n\nAccording to the latest available figures - until April 28 - there are 2,041 laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases since the start of the year in England and Wales compared to 30 last year in the same period, with more than 8,000 notifications from doctors in England and Wales (that figure was just 207 in the same period for 2023).\n\nThese numbers will not be the whole picture because lots of people will not realise they or their children have it and will continue to socialise at work or school, spreading it further. On top of this, not all those affected, including babies, make the characteristic 'whoop' sound between coughs, making it harder to detect.\n\n'Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time,' Dr Amirthalingam says.\n\nAll babies are given three doses of the 6-in-1 jab at eight, 12 and 16 weeks of age to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases such as diphtheria and polio, with a pre-school booster offered at three years four months.\n\nJill Cunningham, 53, from Sunderland, became incontinent with the disease and the cough was so severe that it would make her vomit\n\nBut the vaccine rate in children is also dropping. In September 2023, the number of two-year-olds who'd completed the schedule of routine six-in-one vaccinations (given at eight weeks, three months and four months), which includes protection against pertussis, was 92.9 per cent, compared with 96.3 per cent in March 2014.\n\nWhy is vaccination declining? There are many reasons: vaccine hesitancy that started with MMR and increased during the pandemic as the voices of anti-vaccine campaigners cut through.\n\nBut it is also down to convenience - when it comes to maternity vaccines, pregnant mothers often have other children needing their attention and might struggle to get to an appointment. There may also be a lack of knowledge about why it is so important.\n\nWhooping cough is a cyclical disease that peaks every three to five years. The last cyclical increase occurred in 2016.\n\n'A peak year is therefore overdue. The impact of the pandemic also means there is reduced immunity in the population,' states the UKHSA.\n\nWhich makes both maternal and childhood vaccine more important than ever, says Dr Liz Whittaker, an honorary clinical senior lecturer in the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London. 'The maternal vaccine is a very safe vaccine that we have tested extensively over the last 12 to 14 years and are very confident of.' She herself had the booster in both her pregnancies.\n\nShould the rest of us, who may not be pregnant, consider getting a booster? It is a highly infectious disease and certainly anyone who's had the infection will testify to how awful it is even for grown adults.\n\nJill Cunningham, 53, from Sunderland, started coughing on January 16. She remembers that date because she was in a dermatology appointment for her psoriasis and her nurse was worried she had picked something up. She is on methotrexate, a drug that suppresses her immune system to tackle autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis, which as a result makes her vulnerable to infections.\n\nHer daughter, Isla, 11, was also coughing. But the GP had told her mother children can get up to eight coughs a year from different viruses. Jill just thought this was one of those.\n\nWhile Isla's cough was worse than her usual coughs, Jill's was more aggressive still. She was up all night with it and had to take time off work - she is a self-employed cleaner; she even became incontinent with it and the cough was so severe that it would make her vomit.\n\nIn February Jill went to the GP and saw someone who wasn't her normal doctor and told them she had heard there was whooping cough going around her daughter's school.\n\n'The GP laughed and said this wasn't whooping cough, and that it was a chest infection and gave me antibiotics for it - I now know they weren't the ones needed to treat whooping cough,' Jill told me. 'By that point I'd had to go back to work and so I carried on working.'\n\nThe cough got worse and so in March, she went to see her own GP who this time diagnosed whooping cough - but this was way beyond the first 21 days when it is most infectious. The GP didn't do a swab but did notify the UKHSA. Because she was outside the 21 days, she wasn't given an antibiotic.\n\n'When I tell people about it they don't believe me or take it seriously because there's no news about it - there's no information,' Jill tells me. 'I found out because I started to look it up and then I put it on Facebook, and then other parents from Isla's school got in touch because their children were coughing and then turned out to have it. We've had to find out for ourselves.\n\n'People were saying \"it's just the 100 day cough, it's not serious and doesn't matter\" - not realising how serious it is if babies catch it.'\n\nJill cannot understand the lack of awareness about this, when it is so deadly to babies. 'Why isn't more being done to make people know? I would have kept my daughter off school if I had known it was whooping cough.'\n\nDr Saleyha Ahsan thought she was safe from the disease because she'd had the vaccine - but was proved wrong\n\nThose of you who were vaccinated as a child might think you have nothing to fear. That's what I thought. And when I went to A&E with whooping cough, because I was having laryngospasms - that's when my airway was blocking and I couldn't breathe in - the emergency consultant, who was excellent, assumed as I did that it couldn't be the disease because I'd had the vaccine.\n\nBut I've been learning a lot about this and the fact is that, even after the vaccine, you can still contract whooping cough. Even children get it after the vaccine, but it can make the condition less severe. The protection typically wanes over ten years.\n\nA longer lasting vaccine, developed in the 1950s, provided 80 per cent protection but that version caused some babies to become unwell within hours of receiving it.\n\nDr Doug Jenkinson a retired GP from Nottinghamshire, with a special interest in whooping cough (he runs an awareness website, whoopingcough.net) has written a book called Outbreak In The Village, after his own daughter became unwell when she was given it as a baby in 1969.\n\nNicola was feverish and screaming a few hours after the jab, and because Dr Jenkinson was working as a junior doctor at the time, he managed to get her seen by a paediatric consultant. She recovered after days in hospital.\n\nThis vaccine had been made from killed bacteria, which produces an immune reaction that lasts much longer, but this type of pertussis vaccine is no longer used - and the price has been shorter immunity.\n\nSo who can get the booster?\n\nPregnant women should ensure they are vaccinated. 'Whilst the optimal time for receiving the vaccine is between 20-32 weeks, if you are further along in your pregnancy and not yet had your vaccine, it's not too late,' says Dr Amirthalingam. 'Please speak to your midwife or GP practice today.'\n\nBecause evidence shows that a significant amount of transmission can occur between hospital staff and patients, boosters are offered to healthcare workers, particularly if they are working with high-risk groups such as babies, children and expectant mothers.\n\nYou can pay privately for the jab - it is offered in travel clinics but only on a consultation and only if travelling to certain countries such as Australia - at a cost of around \u00a3100. The issue is that there is no single booster for pertussis. It comes as a combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and polio.\n\nWhat to do if you catch whooping cough\n\nOnce you are in the grips of whooping cough, there's little in terms of medical interventions to offer other than supportive treatment. The phrase 'prevention is better than the cure' rings true here.\n\nOnce you have received a diagnosis either through your doctor or by a swab (if it's in the first 21 days of the cough starting), you will be prescribed an antibiotic, erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin, which kill the Bordella pertussis bacteria that drive the infection.\n\nAs for home treatments, Dr Liz Whittaker says: 'Unfortunately, there's no particular evidence-based way to soothe the cough - the usual over-the-counter remedies may help, making sure they are age appropriate, and pain relief with paracetamol and ibuprofen can help. It is very distressing as a cough.'\n\nDue to coughing fits causing babies and children to vomit, she advises that they eat little and often so as not to lose weight.\n\nI found it helped me to use a dehumidifier and steam inhalations.\n\nThe other point is to prevent the spread. NHS National Medical Director Professor Sir Stephen Powis said: 'If anyone in your family is diagnosed with whooping cough, it's important they stay at home and do not go into work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics, or three weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics. This helps to prevent the spread of infection, especially to vulnerable groups, including infants.'\n\nThere is good news of sorts: claims that whooping cough causes asthma are unlikely to be true. It might be that children with asthma who have whooping cough need extra support, and parents need to look out for the red flags of an asthma attack and seek medical attention, as they normally would. But in terms of whooping cough causing asthma, Dr Whittaker says there's 'not a particular association.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine hesitancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pertussis vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urinary incontinence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placenta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/17/84671761-0-image-a-39_1715272398563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 4104, "textEnd": 4112}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-16", "textStart": 6949, "textEnd": 6959}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-03-", "textStart": 5579, "textEnd": 5589}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has reported 77 cases of the disease since the start of the year. This compares to 18 during the whole of 2023.\n\nWhat is whooping cough?\n\nWhooping cough is a highly infectious bacterial disease involving the lungs and airways. Infants under six months, unimmunised or partially immunised, face the highest risk of severe disease outcomes.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nDr Scott Walkin, a general practitioner in Mayo and the Irish College of General Practitioner/HSE clinical lead for antimicrobial resistance and infection control, said whooping cough typically begins with \"cold-like symptoms\". These include a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat and raised temperature.\n\n\"Between one and two weeks later the cough becomes quite severe. The name whooping cough actually comes from the sound. For some people, though not all people, they are coughing, coughing, coughing and then as they breathe in rapidly it makes a \"whoop\" sound,\" he said.\n\nDr Walkin said the cough can bring up a thick mucus, which is sometimes followed by vomiting.\n\nAnd babies are particularly affected?\n\nYes. The cough may be harder to notice in young babies, but they can have short periods when they stop breathing. This is why the HSE says it is important to get medical help urgently if your child has symptoms and is less than 12 months old. \"The group of people most at risk are young babies under six months. The younger they are, the higher the risk,\" Dr Walkin added.\n\nShould I immediately go to a doctor if I think my child has whooping cough?\n\nAccording to Dr Walkin, there is \"very little\" that can be done to treat whooping cough as \"antibiotics have no effects on treating the symptoms\".\n\nIf the child is less than 12 months old, has a cough that is getting worse and has a cough that has lasted longer than three weeks HSE guidance, published on its website, states parents should seek urgent help from their GP.\n\nAccording to the guidance, parents should go to the nearest emergency department if the child is having a lot of trouble with breathing, for example long periods of breathlessness or choking, or periods where breathing stops; if their skin or lips turn a dark or blue colour; if they have a seizure or a fit; or if they develop a pain in their chest, as this could be a sign of pneumonia.\n\nWhat treatments are there?\n\nAs Dr Walkin said there are very few treatments available, but advised on keeping sick people at home if possible unless they obviously require medical attention as the disease is highly infectious.\n\n\"If a child or person with whooping cough has a fever or is feeling achey or has sore ears they can be treated with Calpol or Nurofen (paracetamol or ibuprofen),\" he said. \"The evidence for use of cough syrup in children under six is very weak.\"\n\nHow can I protect my child against whooping cough?\n\n\"The most important and best way to manage whooping cough is to prevent it. That means vaccination,\" Dr Walkin said. \"They are given at two months, four months and six months. Then there is a booster in junior infants, and a booster in first year [of secondary school]. It is important to get each of those vaccines on time, every time.\"\n\nChildren under two months old are not eligible for vaccination, but are still at risk from the disease. \"The clever way to protect these children is for a pregnant lady to be vaccinated during pregnancy, because her body will develop antibodies that cross the placenta into the baby.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nEuropean countries have reported a surge in whooping coughc ases in first quarter of 2024, with 10 times as many identified as in each of the previous two years.\n\nNearly 60,000 cases were reported by European Union and European Economic Area countries over the period, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said on Wednesday, with 11 deaths in infants and eight among older adults.\n\nIn the UK cases of whooping cough could reach a 40-year high in 2024, experts have warned amid a rapid rise in cases.\n\nWhooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial infection of the lungs and airways, and is endemic in Europe. It can be very dangerous for young babies or older people.\n\nBigger whooping cough epidemics are expected every 3-5 years even in countries with high vaccination rates, the ECDC said, although a slight dip in immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in the rise. Circulation of whooping cough was also very low during the pandemic and its related restrictions on movement, making the rise seem larger.\n\nThe numbers are still historically high, though. In the first three months of 2024, there have already been as many cases as there were in an average year between 2012 and 2019.\n\nThe agency noted that much of the population had missed out on natural boosting of their immunity to whooping cough because they had not been exposed to it during the pandemic.\n\nBabies under six months are at particular risk from the infection.\n\n\"It's essential to remember the lives at stake, especially our little ones. Vaccines against pertussis have proven to be safe and effective,\" said ECDC Director Andrea Ammon.\n\nMost European countries routinely immunise children against pertussis and many also vaccinate pregnant women to protect their babies.\n\nThe ECDC said some countries may want to consider giving boosters to older children and adults too, as immunity can wane.\n\nPaul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: \"For most adults the whooping cough is not life threatening, though can be very unpleasant.\n\n\"This is a chronic repeated bout of coughing which can be so bad that people feel it a struggle to breathe in again.\n\n\"It used to be much more common in the last century up until the vaccine was introduced.\n\n\"However, this current year looks like we may see more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years.\"\n\nProf Hunter said that a number of factors could be behind the rise in cases, including: a drop in vaccine uptake; reduced \"population immunity\" due to a fall in cases linked to social distancing measures during the pandemic; and a \"scare over vaccines\" in the early 2000s which led to a group of people aged around 21 who did not complete their vaccination.\n\nHe added: \"The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some that are.\n\n\"However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old.\n\n\"It is this age group that are most at risk of death and developing longer-term problems such as brain damage.\n\n\"The problem is that this age group is too young for the vaccine in most circumstances.\n\n\"That is why we offer vaccine to pregnant women. Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life.\n\n\"Vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been falling quite markedly in recent years.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Ammon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Ammon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of East Anglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herd immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2011/09/19/13/648812.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

This includes students with a chronic illness or weakened immune system and those who live with a family member with a chronic illness or weakened immune system, an infant or a pregnant woman.\n\nAny school-age children with symptoms of pertussis should stay home from school and see a health care provider.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of whooping cough or pertussis?\n\nThe early symptoms are similar to a common cold: runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever and coughing. After one to two weeks, the cough often gets worse, changing from a dry, hacking cough to bursts of uncontrollable, sometimes violent, coughing.\n\nThe vaccine against pertussis is routine and required for school-age kids.

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show 2,793 cases were reported to the end of March, compared with 858 cases for the whole of 2023.\n\nScores of people shared their experiences with the Guardian, with many describing hacking coughs that left them feeling as if they couldn't breathe. Some were prescribed antibiotics to help with the infection but many said that when they saw their GPs, it was too late for a course of medication to be effective. Others expressed their concern over the lack of testing and official diagnosis.\n\nWith cases of whooping cough on the rise in adults and children, four people share their experience of the \"100-day cough\".\n\nFor Rachi Weerasinghe, 56, who is still coughing two months on from becoming ill, the sensation when he can't catch his breath feels as if he's \"drowning in phlegm\".\n\nHis symptoms started in the middle of March while he was commuting into London, where he works as a management consultant. \"I felt like I was coming down with something nasty,\" said Weerasinghe, who lives in Hinchley Wood, Surrey.\n\nA week later after being \"hit by an illness like no other\" with hot and cold sweats, a dizzying fever and coughing fits that would \"sometimes last 15 minutes\", he booked a doctor's appointment.\n\n\"I ended up seeing the GP three times - each time a different person,\" he said. \"I was prescribed a round of antibiotics only to return a week later for another set of stronger ones. The last person I saw said it might be whooping cough and I was given another course of antibiotics, this time azithromycin.\n\n\"I have arthritis and am immunocompromised, so it's quite routine for me to go to the GP with a chest infection. I'm normally quite healthy and can manage through exercise, but I can't seem to fight this off and still have some difficulty speaking.\"\n\nAnna Zueva, 45, from Shipley, West Yorkshire, mentioned her \"worry\" over her children having whooping cough as well as herself. Her son and daughter, 13 and seven, both developed symptoms after her own started on 10 March.\n\nZueva, who works as a senior lecturer in management at the University of Huddersfield, and has asthma, said she saw a nurse at her local surgery who told her that her illness was \"probably viral\" and medication would be \"of no use\". Over the next two weeks her symptoms worsened and she saw her GP, who said there was a potential for whooping cough and prescribed her antibiotics.\n\nOn the same day her children started experiencing a slight fever that went away quickly, followed by a worsening cough. With the family travelling on 28 March to see elderly relatives in Northern Ireland, Zueva started \"panicking\" that the children might be infectious.\n\nThe evening before they were due to leave she called 111 and was given an 8am telephone appointment with her GP the next day. \"They agreed to prescribe my children antibiotics over the phone,\" she said. \"Obtaining these from pharmacists, however, was a challenge as most were out of stock due to supply issues.\n\n\"For my son we managed to get them at the third pharmacy we visited. For my daughter, who needed a special dose because of her age and weight, we stopped at six or seven. In the end we got them from a pharmacy [after we arrived] in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nOn the same day she received a call from a government health agency saying they would be sent test kits for the children to check for whooping cough.\n\n\"[The kits] didn't arrive till mid-April and even though we sent them back immediately, we're still waiting for the results. The preventive measures against something as terrible as whooping cough seem to be nonexistent, and there doesn't seem to be a facility for timely tests,\" Zueva said.\n\n\"My children only developed a moderate cough. I think it helped that they were vaccinated and I think it's hugely important that people are. I would love to see boosters made available to everyone, though.\"\n\nLike Zueva, Michael Angove was told he would be sent a whooping cough test kit but \"it didn't show up\". His symptoms had started in early March when he had a \"tickly cough\" and his chest began \"feeling raw\".\n\nDuring the third week the cough started to wake him up in the middle of the night. \"One time I woke up and tried to get up as I struggled to inhale,\" said the 51-year-old, who lives in Devizes, Wiltshire.\n\n\"The very next moment I was coming around on the floor with blood on my head and on the carpet. I didn't know if I was in a dream, but later realised I had collapsed on to the bedstead and hit my brow. The damage was superficial but I had a severe looking black eye for two weeks. It was terrifying.\"\n\nOn the same day Angove called his GP and mentioned that his neighbour had similar symptoms. He was referred to a local walk-in centre later that day and he said the doctor \"knew exactly\" what he was describing, and prescribed antibiotics. \"He said it was whooping cough and the government would send me a test kit so I could provide a sample in order to get a formal diagnosis.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, after the test had not arrived, he followed up with his GP surgery \"who couldn't explain\" what had happened to the test. He was provided with a number to call but \"all [my] calls were left unanswered - they just rang and rang\".\n\n\"My care was very good but I feel the official numbers for this year won't be accurate because I didn't get a test,\" Angove said. \"I know so many people here who have had whooping cough symptoms for 60 to 90 days who might not have been tested. I'm still waiting, nearly two months on.\"\n\nFor some readers, the concern has been whether they have whooping cough or not.\n\nOn 20 February after coming into contact with a client who was coughing, Joanne Noton, 43, a personal trainer from north-east Lincolnshire, developed a \"chesty cough with phlegm\". A week later the cough became \"uncontrollable\", and she went to a GP who prescribed amoxicillin for a suspected chest infection.\n\nDuring this time she developed the \"distinctive whoop\" and had to cancel her classes. In the evenings she began vomiting due to the \"harshness\" of the coughing, and by week four, she went to her GP with severe abdominal pain.\n\n\"He sent me to A&E and [I waited] for three hours,\" she said. \"There were other people who were violently coughing and holding sick bowls. They thought I had a bowel blockage but a scan showed I had a rib cartilage fracture from excessive coughing.\n\n\"I said to the consultant I thought I had whooping cough and he didn't seem to take me seriously. It was almost as if what I said wasn't valid.\"\n\nIn April, after two months of coughing and a chest X-ray showing no signs of infection, Noton noticed she was losing her breath \"really quickly\" after a burst of activity. \"I went to see a nurse and she believes I have the onset of asthma as a result of whooping cough, even though my original diagnosis was bronchitis,\" she said.\n\n\"I am a very fit person, as it's part of my job, so all of this came as a shock. I feel better in myself now and am back to working and exercising, but I'm still coughing. I feel a bit like I've not been listened to and I wish I pushed more to get tested.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Parents, siblings, and caregivers are the silent carriers of this infection, unknowingly passing it on to infants. Widespread vaccination is essential to combat this disease and safeguard everyone.\"\n\nShe advises expectant mothers to be more vigilant during this outbreak, noting: \"While this vaccine-preventable disease can affect people of all ages, pregnant women are at greater risk due to the natural suppression of their immune systems during pregnancy.\"\n\nContracting pertussis during pregnancy poses significant risks to both the mother and the unborn baby.\n\nScientific research shows that pregnant women who become infected are more likely to experience severe illness and complications, including respiratory distress and increased hospitalization.\n\nMoreover, the consequences can be even more serious for infants under one year old, as they may experience pneumonia, brain damage, and, in the most severe cases, death.\n\n\"Receiving the Adacel vaccine during 28 to 32 weeks of pregnancy is the best decision expectant mothers can make. This vaccine safeguards individuals aged 10 to 64 against whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria in just one shot. We recommend getting this vaccine ideally in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if you've been vaccinated before,\" said Kruger.\n\nVaccination during pregnancy is safe and highly effective for both the mother and the baby.\n\nThe vaccine transfers antibodies to the unborn baby, protecting them from pertussis during their first weeks of life before they receive their first vaccines.\n\nConsidering medical history and pregnancy status, it is recommended to consult healthcare providers before receiving the vaccine.\n\nWhooping cough symptoms begin with a mild cough and runny nose, similar to a cold.\n\nAfter one to two weeks, it can lead to severe, prolonged coughing fits, especially at night, with a 'whooping' sound when breathing.\n\nThick mucus may be produced, and a high-pitched wheeze might follow. Vomiting from intense coughing can also occur.\n\nTimely identification of pertussis is crucial for protecting public health.\n\nEarly diagnosis not only saves lives but also substantially improves community health outcomes.\n\nIndividuals suspecting they're infected should consult their pharmacist or healthcare provider immediately.\n\nStarting antibiotic treatment without delay is most effective in mitigating both the intensity and duration of the illness.\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, Dis-Chem recommends practicing good hygiene habits, such as regular handwashing and covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n\nThrow used tissues in the bin, and if you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hand.\n\nDuring the final weeks of pregnancy, it's crucial to avoid close contact with individuals showing symptoms, as whooping cough bacteria can spread through airborne droplets.\n\nIndividuals are also advised to stay informed about symptoms and prevention measures to enable information sharing, raise awareness, and prevent its spread among family, friends, and colleagues.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine-preventable_diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine-preventable diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tetanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airborne transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.citizen.co.za/northern-natal-news/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2021/06/105398320_s.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

babies in England have died as a result of whooping cough, amid an epidemic of the infection across Europe.\n\nWhooping cough is on the rise in England, with 2,700 cases reported so far this year - 1,319 of which were in March alone - marking a huge leap since 2023, when just 858 cases were reported.\n\nAcross EU countries, nearly 60,000 cases were reported in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, accprding to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the five infant deaths in England had occurred between January and March this year, and urged people to have their children vaccinated against the infection.\n\nProfessor Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, told PA: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\"\n\nWhooping cough is a bacterial infection that can be contracted through contact with another infected person.\n\nWhooping cough is highly contagious, with people able to spread the infection to others from around six days after the symptoms begin to around three weeks after the cough develops, according to the NHS.\n\nSymptoms include classic cold symptoms such as a runny nose and sore throat, and after a week develop into a cough that lasts for a few minutes (worse at night) that is often (but not always) punctuated with a whooping or whooshing sound in between as the patient gasps for air in between coughs.\n\nThe NHS also describes symptoms such as: difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants)/bringing up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit/becoming very red in the face (more common in adults).", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

This marks the most significant local outbreak of the bacterial infection, which affects the airways and lungs, since 2017.\n\nLast Thursday, the number of cases was at 53.\n\nPublic Information Officer Andrew Mundhenk told BPR on Monday no one has been hospitalized so far, and most cases continue to be in school-aged children. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is highly contagious, spreading easily when someone coughs or sneezes. Officials say the increase in cases is not unusual, noting that most of the transmission is occurring within households.\n\nHealth Director Steve Smith says the department became aware of the first case onApril 3. And while the majority of cases are among school-aged children, many adults are diagnosed - including some who didn't even realize they had whooping cough. Smith says that's because the illness often presents as a common cold.\n\n\"So what we realized in talking with some of these folks is that they've had pertussis and never realized that. And as you might imagine they are infectious and transmitting this disease and that may have gone on for two weeks without knowing that they had pertussis. So we expect that there will be more cases and that it's going to take us a while to get ahead of this,\" Smith said.\n\nAs health officials track the spread, they continue to stress the importance of covering your mouth or nose when you cough and sneeze, along with frequent handwashing, to prevent transmission. Smith says the community should remain mindful of symptoms and remember that vaccination provides the most effective protection against whooping cough.\n\nResidents who need a Tdap vaccine can call their healthcare provider or the Henderson County Health Department at 828-692-4223.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hand washing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e974500/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1732x974+14+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2F2a%2F22116d6b4bfa9facfa7856e2a518%2Fnews-update.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

risk", "body": "WHOOPING cough might sound like a disease from the Victorian era, but the bacterial bug has made a dramatic comeback in recent months.\n\nThe '100-day cough', as it's also known, infects the lungs and breathing tubes, causing severe coughing fits and flu-like symptoms that, as the name suggests, can last for months.\n\nIn January and February alone, England recorded 1,468 cases, up 8,055 per cent when from the 18 cases during the same period in 2023.\n\nSuspected cases, reported by doctors in England and Wales each week, suggest infection rates are especially high in the South East (141) and London (113).\n\nBabies under six months are at risk of serious complications because they are too young to be immunised with the existing vaccine.\n\nThe infection can develop into pneumonia, seizures and, in some cases, death.\n\nBabies and young children who survive may have long-term neurological or lung damage.\n\nOlder children and adults can also get whooping cough - as neither vaccination nor infection provides lifelong immunity - and it is highly infectious.\n\nWhooping cough - caused by the pertussis bacteria - naturally peaks every three to five years.\n\nA jab, which started to be given to children in the 1950s, helped almost eliminate the disease in Britain.\n\nFrom 2012, a whooping cough jab was offered to pregnant women in the UK, in the hope a mother's antibodies would pass to her baby in the womb, giving protection from birth.\n\n\"This has resulted in a decline in the incidence of whooping cough in infants aged under three months,\" the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence notes.\n\nExperts have warned that a steady drop in vaccine uptake and weakened immunity from the Covid restrictions have contributed to rapidly rising case numbers.\n\n\"During lockdown (when social distancing measures were in place) the number of infections went down, so people who may have caught it then are catching it now,\" Prof Helen Bedford, an expert in child public health at University College London, told the Sun.\n\nAdam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, agreed, adding the restrictions meant fewer whooping cough infections and, therefore, a smaller number of people with immunity.\n\n\"And that means that when an infection comes, it gets more opportunities to spread,\" he told the Guardian.\n\n\"Another problem is that vaccination uptake is steadily declining in pregnant women,\" Prof Helen added.\n\nIn Britain, around 70 per cent of pregnant women were jabbed for pertussis in 2017.\n\nThat number dropped to around 58 per cent by 2023, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)\n\nVaccine uptake in children has also fallen.\n\nThe whooping cough vaccine is given alongside five others to babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks and as part of a four-in-one booster to preschool children aged three years and four months.\n\nThe number of two-year-olds who completed their six-in-one vaccinations as of September 2023 was 92.9 per cent, compared with 96.3 per cent in March 2014.\n\nProf Helen also points out the 2004 switch from a whole-cell to an acellular vaccine for whooping cough.\n\nIn the past, whooping cough vaccines were made using whole, inactivated Bordetella pertussis bacteria.\n\nThese vaccines were highly effective but had some adverse side effects, including fever and mild allergic reaction.\n\nIn a very small number of babies, neurological damage, however, there is debate over whether the jab was responsible.\n\nModern whooping cough jabs are made from purified and detoxified parts of the bacteria.\n\n\"The newer vaccine is highly effective, but the duration of protection is shorter (than that old jab),\" Prof Helen said.\n\nExperts say it is vital for pregnant women to get vaccinated and ensure their babies and young children receive the vaccine.\n\nDr Gayatri added: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young infants, it can be particularly serious.\n\n\"However, vaccinating pregnant women is highly effective in protecting babies from birth until they can receive their own vaccines.\n\n\"Parents can also help protect their children by ensuring they receive their vaccines at the right time or catching up as soon as possible if they have missed any.\n\n\"If you're unsure, please check your child's red book or get in touch with your GP surgery.\"\n\nSteve Russell, national director for vaccinations and screening at NHS England, said that people can contact their GP to book a vaccination appointment.\n\nThose with symptoms should \"ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111,\" he added.\n\nPeople with whooping cough are advised to stay at home for 48 hours after starting antibiotics or three weeks after symptoms start if they have not had antibiotics.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors":

Sometimes symptoms do not develop for as long as 3 weeks.\n\n\ud83d\udccc In its early stages, whooping cough appears to be nothing more than the common cold. This stage may last a couple of weeks. Symptoms may include a runny or stuffed-up nose, low-grade fever, a mild and occasional cough in children and adults, and apnea (life-threatening pauses in breathing) and cyanosis (turning blue or purple) in babies and young children.\n\n\ud83d\udccc In Stage 2, people with whooping cough may develop rapid, violent, and uncontrolled coughing fits. These coughing fits usually last 1 to 6 weeks but can last for up to 10 weeks. The coughing fits can cause people to make a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound when they are finally able to inhale at the end of a coughing fit, vomit during or after coughing fits.\n\n\ud83d\udccc The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that one sees a doctor, if one is struggling to breathe, turning blue or purple, coughing violently, coughing rapidly over and over, or not drinking enough fluids. \ud83d\udccc Vaccinated people may not get as sick as the vaccines are effective, but not perfect. In vaccinated people who get the cough, the symptoms are subdued.\n\n\ud83d\udccc As one recovers, the coughing fits may stop for a while but can return if one gets other respiratory infections.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyanosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apnea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Whopping.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

This highly contagious respiratory infection has become a cause for concern not just locally but also on a global scale. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has reported a staggering 50 confirmed cases of whooping cough in South Africa since the beginning of 2024, raising alarms among healthcare professionals and the general public alike.\n\nWhooping Cough Outbreak In South Africa\n\nLocal media have also covered Medical News reports of the Pertussis outbreak in South Africa.\n\nhttps://www.citizen.co.za/northern-natal-news/news-headlines/2024/05/06/nicd-warns-of-whooping-cough-outbreak-in-south-africa/\n\nUnderstanding Whooping Cough\n\nWhooping cough is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis and primarily affects the respiratory tract. It is characterized by severe bouts of coughing, often followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like a \"whoop.\" While the disease was historically associated with childhood, its prevalence among teenagers and adults, whose immunity may have waned over time, has also become a significant concern.\n\nGlobal Context and Rise in Cases\n\nThe surge in whooping cough cases is not unique to South Africa but is part of a broader global trend. Many countries worldwide have witnessed an increase in pertussis infections, highlighting the need for concerted efforts in disease surveillance, prevention, and management. Factors contributing to this rise include vaccine hesitancy, incomplete immunization schedules, and waning immunity in older age groups.\n\nUrgency of Vaccination\n\nVaccination remains the most effective strategy for preventing whooping cough and its potentially severe complications. Lizeth Kruger, an executive at Dis-Chem Clinic, emphasizes the critical role of vaccination in curbing the spread of pertussis. She underscores the importance of expectant mothers receiving the Adacel vaccine during the 28 to 32 weeks of pregnancy, as it not only protects mothers but also confers immunity to newborns during their vulnerable early weeks of life.\n\nRisks During Pregnancy and Early Infancy\n\nPregnant women are particularly vulnerable to whooping cough due to changes in their immune system. Contracting the infection during pregnancy can lead to severe illness, complications, and adverse outcomes for both the mother and the unborn child. Infants under one year old, especially those too young to be fully vaccinated, face heightened risks of complications such as pneumonia, brain damage, and, in severe cases, death.\n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis\n\nRecognizing the symptoms of whooping cough is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. Initial signs often mimic those of a common cold, including a runny nose, cough, and mild fever. However, as the infection progresses, severe and persistent coughing fits, vomiting, breathing difficulties, and the characteristic \"whoop\" sound during inhalation may occur, particularly in children.\n\nImportance of Prompt Treatment\n\nPrompt initiation of antibiotic treatment upon suspicion of whooping cough is essential in reducing the severity and duration of the illness. Timely diagnosis and intervention not only improve individual outcomes but also play a significant role in preventing further transmission within communities.\n\nPublic Health Strategies\n\nIn addition to vaccination and treatment, public health strategies play a crucial role in combating whooping cough. These include promoting good hygiene practices such as regular handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding close contact with symptomatic individuals. Heightened awareness, education campaigns, and access to healthcare services are fundamental components of comprehensive disease control efforts.\n\nContainment Measures and Isolation\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with whooping cough should adhere to recommended isolation protocols to minimize the risk of spreading the infection. Isolation periods typically extend until the contagious phase of the illness subsides, which is usually after completing a course of antibiotics and receiving medical clearance.\n\nAddressing Challenges and Future Outlook\n\nChallenges in addressing whooping cough include overcoming vaccine hesitancy, ensuring equitable access to healthcare services, and sustaining public awareness and education initiatives. Collaborative efforts between healthcare providers, government agencies, and community stakeholders are crucial for effective disease control, prevention, and mitigation of the impact of whooping cough outbreaks.\n\nConclusion: Towards a Healthier Future\n\nIn conclusion, the growing concern of whooping cough in South Africa underscores the importance of proactive public health measures, vaccination advocacy, early diagnosis, and prompt treatment. By prioritizing immunization, promoting awareness, implementing robust containment strategies, and addressing underlying challenges, stakeholders can work together to mitigate the impact of this contagious respiratory infection and contribute to a healthier future for all.\n\nFor the latest on the whooping cough outbreak in South Africa, keep on logging to Thailand Medical News.", "source": {"uri": "thailandmedical.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Home - Thailand Medical News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella_pertussis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bordetella pertussis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine hesitancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thailandmedical.news/uploads/news/663981e5c2a03_Medical-News-South-African-Health-Authorities-Warn-Of-Whooping-Cough-Outbreak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

By the same time this year, there had been 52 such cases reported, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Controls.\n\nWhooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory infection which can be particularly dangerous for infants. It is easily prevented through routine childhood vaccination and if caught, treatable with antibiotics.\n\n\"We see pertussis rates cycle, sometimes year to year, both locally and nationally. Since 2017 cases in South Carolina have varied from 45 to 221 annually,\" said a spokesman for DHEC in an email. \"Contributors to increases in cases may be related to declining vaccination coverage, additional spread from cases in group settings like schools and childcare settings that lead to local outbreaks, and increased testing by health care providers.\n\nThe number of cases is only continuing to grow.\n\nLast year, the state saw a total of 77 cases of whooping cough across the entire year. As of May 7, 2024, the state already had 81 cases reported.\n\nIn the Upstate, there were 33 cases reported this time last year, 58 so far this year.\n\nIn North Carolina, the numbers aren't great either.\n\nLast week, a whooping cough outbreak was reported in Henderson County.\n\nAccording to health officials there, the county has seen 74 cases of whooping cough this year, with the majority of transmissions being among school-aged children and occurring in household units.\n\n\"We continue to emphasize the importance of good hygiene prevent spread (covering coughs/sneezes, frequent hand washing), being mindful of Pertussis symptoms and contacting your healthcare provider if you think you or your child may have whooping cough,\" said a representative of Henderson County Health Department.\"If you or your child has symptoms, we encourage you to contact your healthcare provider earlier than you normally may.

What's deeply \u00adworrying is that some very young babies have died from it. The cough is whooping cough -- or pertussis.\n\nThis is an illness that can be prevented, or its impact reduced, by vaccination.\n\nBut there's been a surge in cases recently: you may well have heard people complaining about the 100-day cough. I've had it (and ended up in A&E when I couldn't breathe) and wrote about it for Mail Online.\n\nSince January, there have already been 8,015 doctor notifications (whooping cough is a notifiable disease) and 2,041 laboratory-confirmed cases, compared with just 207 (so a rise of about 3,800 per cent) and 30 respectively last year for the same period.\n\nThere were 52 cases of babies under three months with \u00adwhooping cough in \u00adJanuary and February alone this year; by contrast, there were only 48 cases for the whole of last year.\n\nRiley Hughes (pictured with his mum Catherine) was otherwise healthy when he died from whooping cough aged just 32 days in 2015\n\nAnd these figures may be a significant underestimate, as people with mild \u00addisease may not see a doctor.\n\n'We are seeing massive numbers of cases of pertussis at the moment,' Dr Liz Whittaker, a paediatric consultant and honorary clinical senior lecturer in the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London, tells me.\n\nPaediatric intensive care units are on 'surge capacity' for pertussis and measles, meaning there are many cases.\n\nDr Ronny Cheung, a consultant \u00adpaediatrician from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, adds: 'There's no doubt we've been seeing quite a lot more of it on the wards and A&E in recent times. My suspicion is we're \u00adprobably still underestimating the true prevalence at the moment.'\n\nWhile adults describe it as the worst cough they've ever had -- causing \u00addifficulty breathing, incontinence and even fractured ribs -- it can be fatal in babies. 'The mortality is one death in every 100 in the under three months category,' says Dr Whittaker. 'We don't see this in other age groups.\n\n'As well as coughing, which is quite severe, they can stop breathing.'\n\nTheir white blood cells also increase, sometimes \u00adreaching very high levels, 'causing the blood vessels to clog up, and causing \u00adcardiac failure', adds Dr Whittaker.\n\nThe rise in cases has already claimed the lives of babies too young to receive the vaccine.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported the death of one baby in the last quarter of 2023. But \u00adcolleagues have told me of further deaths that aren't yet showing in official figures.\n\nWhooping cough is a highly infectious bacterial infection, but those under three months are most at risk because they're too young to be vaccinated.\n\nThe first dose of the pertussis vaccine is normally given at two months, which is why pregnant women are offered the jab between 16 and 32 weeks as the antibodies pass across the \u00adplacenta and \u00adprotect the baby in the first few months of life. \u00ad\n\nDozens of babies in the UK used to die every year before this \u00advaccination \u00adprogramme was introduced.\n\n'Most of our admissions are still in the pre-immunisation under-three-month group,' says Dr \u00adCheung. 'I've seen these babies in my practice where they come with coughing bouts, apnoea [pauses in breathing] or looking very dusky [i.e. blue] or \u00addesaturating [with low oxygen levels], and that's very worrying.'\n\nThe number of two-year-olds who have had the full round of vaccinations has dropped over the past decade and cases of whooping cough are shooting up\n\nDanielle Knox knows just how terrifying this can be. Her then seven-week old son Tom was admitted to hospital for a week in December with a severe cough and episodes of apnoea. He was treated with antibiotics and needed regular suctioning.\n\nAs Danielle, 33, a health \u00adsciences lecturer from Glasgow, told me last week, because Tom didn't have a 'whoop' sound, he wasn't tested for pertussis; but very young babies do not have the typical 'whoop'.\n\nOther children need multiple readmissions for it. 'I had a patient who was admitted for the third time in six weeks -- they're still having blue spells at night,' explains Dr Cheung.\n\nAirfinity, a disease-forecasting company, says 'the risk of \u00adinfections is expected to remain elevated in the coming weeks'.\n\nOne of the problems is low rates of vaccination. In September 2023 the number of two-year-olds who'd completed the schedule of routine six-in-one vaccinations (given at eight weeks, three months and four months), which includes protection against \u00adpertussis, was 92.9 per cent; in 2014 it was 96.3 per cent.\n\nAnd lack of awareness means the disease continues to spread.\n\nBryony Thomson's ten-year-old daughter had whooping cough, leaving her unable to breathe. The family moved a mattress into the bathroom so she could sleep there with the hot water running during the night -- the steam gave relief.\n\nBryony, 38, who is a vet in \u00adWhitburn, County Durham, asked the headteacher to alert other \u00adparents, because so many other children were coughing, too. But the UKHSA advised against it because there was only one reported case. It requires two unrelated cases to send out a \u00adformal alert.\n\nBy the first week in January, Bryony's daughter was coughing four times a minute and was taken to A&E in the middle of the night. 'She was gasping for air and started to turn blue. I was really frightened.'\n\nOne doctor told Bryony that her daughter would be fine and that 'nobody dies of whooping cough these days'.\n\nAdults, though not as vulnerable as babies with the disease, can end up breaking a rib such is the force of the coughing\n\nBryony's daughter survived; Riley Hughes was not so lucky. The otherwise healthy baby died from \u00adwhooping cough aged just 32 days in 2015.\n\nAt three weeks old, he'd \u00addeveloped a mild cold and \u00adoccasional cough. A doctor \u00adreassured his parents, Catherine and Greg, he was fine. But Riley was sleepy and not waking for feeds, so they took him to hospital.\n\nHe was admitted and diagnosed with pertussis. His condition quickly deteriorated and he was put on life support.\n\n'I wish I could remember the last time I saw Riley conscious,' Catherine tells me. 'I just have no memory of looking into his eyes for the last time.'\n\nShe'd gone home to rest (she'd been in hospital for four days with virtually no sleep and was exhausted), not realising time was so short. But Greg was there for their son's last conscious hours.\n\n'Riley was screaming and screaming. He would have been in a lot of pain from the needles and \u00adcannulas they were \u00adadministering. That's how my baby will last remember the world,' she says.\n\nAt 3am she got an urgent call from Greg telling her: 'The doctors say you've got to come in, quickly.'\n\n'Riley was placed in my arms -- I was shocked at how burning hot and swollen his tiny body was,' says the mother of two from Perth, Australia. 'The tubes were removed, and we cuddled, cried, kissed him, and sang to him a lullaby as the life slowly drained out of him.\n\n'At 2pm, our beautiful baby left us, left this world, and left us devastated and heartbroken.\n\nREAD MORE: My terrifying 100-day cough: A&E doctor tells how she was left unable to breathe for 30 seconds by whooping cough - as cases soar around the country. So should you be worried?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'If I had been offered a \u00adwhooping cough booster during pregnancy, there is a good chance Riley would still be with us today.'\n\nBut when Catherine was \u00adpregnant, it was before Australia offered the maternal pertussis vaccine. Days after Riley's death the vaccine programme began, resulting in a significant \u00adreduction in babies hospitalised with \u00adpertussis.\n\n'It's bittersweet -- I'm overjoyed that we have these \u00adfantastic \u00adpregnancy vaccination programnes, but really sad they weren't implemented in time for Riley,' says Catherine, who now campaigns to encourage women to be vaccinated.\n\nYet the uptake among pregnant women in the UK has fallen dramatically, from 74.7 per cent in 2017 to just 59.5 per cent in 2023. Dr Whittaker says that in parts of London it's as low as 36 per cent.\n\nThe decline in the pre-school booster's dose also deeply \u00adworries experts. 'In Harringay it's down to 56 per cent and 65 per cent in Hammersmith and Fulham in London,' explains Dr Whittaker. 'This means we have primary school-age children who don't have adequate protection. They all hang out together and pass it on.'\n\n'In addition, their parents have waning immunity and pick it up, then they pass it on. You've got this little perfect storm of \u00adpertussis-passing going on.'\n\n'The risk is that it's passed on to somebody who is immunocompromised or to a baby.'\n\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'We would urge all parents to check that their children's \u00advaccinations -- and their own -- are up to date.'\n\nThis is what drives Catherine.

This significant change was officially announced in today's edition of the State Gazette, marking a pivotal step in safeguarding infants against whooping cough.\n\nAccording to the amended schedule, the subsequent doses of the combined vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough will also be administered earlier, with vaccinations scheduled at 10 and 14 weeks of age, respectively. These adjustments aim to optimize the timing of immunizations, ensuring timely protection against preventable diseases for infants.\n\nMoreover, the revised guidelines extend the recommendation for whooping cough immunization to individuals born before January 1, 2008, who have not received a pertussis vaccine within the past 5 to 10 years. This proactive approach underscores the importance of maintaining immunity against whooping cough, especially among vulnerable populations.\n\nFurthermore, the updated recommendations emphasize the importance of pertussis vaccination for pregnant women, advising immunization between the 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy. By prioritizing maternal immunization, Bulgaria aims to provide passive protection to newborns during the critical early stages of life.\n\nAdditionally, the revised guidelines extend pertussis vaccination recommendations to elderly individuals who are in close contact with infants up to 1 year old.

A total of 1,319 cases were reported in England during the month of March, the public health body said.\n\nThe provisional figures for January to March included the deaths of five babies aged under three months, who are most at risk of dying from the disease.\n\nThe rise in whooping cough -- known clinically as pertussis -- follows a big drop in the number of expectant mothers taking up a highly effective antenatal vaccine that protects unborn babies against the disease.\n\nSince 2012 pregnant women have been offered the vaccine, which creates antibodies in the unborn child via the placenta, providing very high rates of protection until the child is old enough to be vaccinated.\n\nThe introduction of the antenatal jab reduced the number of infant deaths by two-thirds to 21 between October 2012 and the end of last year, compared with 63 in the 12 years before its introduction.\n\nHowever, uptake has dropped from more than 70 per cent in September 2017, to about 58 per cent in September 2023.\n\n\"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time,\" said Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA.\n\n\"Whopping cough can affect people of all ages, but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nProfessor Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, added that it was \"vital\" families come forward and get vaccinated.\n\nThe call comes amid a wider battle to boost vaccination rates for dangerous childhood diseases, with jab hesitancy stoked during the pandemic. A resurgence of measles in England was also reported earlier this year.\n\n\"If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up-to-date with whooping cough or other routine vaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible, and if you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111,\" Prof Powis said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placenta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service (England)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F9112f1f7-0645-45e7-9d22-a2dba54096c3.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-10-", "textStart": 1123, "textEnd": 1135}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-", "textStart": 1279, "textEnd": 1293}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The May 3 letter was worded similarly to past letters about cases sent on April 18, April 22 and April 25. Like the previous three letters, the May 3 letter did not specify how many cases of whooping cough had been diagnosed nor how many students or staff had been exposed.\n\nHowever, North Shore Health Department officer Becky Rowland said in a May 3 email to a reporter that there are still less than five cases. She also said the department has asked district administrators to notify the whole Whitefish Bay School District.\n\nWhitefish Bay School District executive assistant to the district administrator and communications specialist Julie Pitel did not specify in her email sending the May 3 letter to a reporter the number of cases or how many people may have been exposed. Pitel also did not immediately respond to a follow-up email from a reporter asking how many cases there are now and whether the district plans to notify the whole district about the cases at the high school.\n\nThe North Shore Health Department also said in its news release that it recommends children stay up to date with their DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccinations. It also recommends adults, older children at age 11 or 12 should get the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccination. The department also recommends the Tdap vaccine for pregnant women during each pregnancy.\n\nThe department recommends contacting a healthcare provider if you or your child exhibit symptoms that could be pertussis. It also recommends taking antibiotics to minimize the illness' severity and spread; practicing good hygiene such as covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or with your upper sleeve or elbow when you cough or sneeze; throwing that tissue away after using it; and washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand rub is recommended if soap and water are not available, the department's news release said.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish_Bay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whitefish Bay"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefish_Bay_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whitefish Bay High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DPT vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tetanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Community_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Community Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/11/25/PMJS/d1f56b2d-6636-4e97-84e6-22982bb82dbc-MJS_bay16-11.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y112&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "dateEnd": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1232, "textEnd": 1253}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1104, "textEnd": 1110}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 249, "textEnd": 254, "freq": 6}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 1098, "textEnd": 1106}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 1222, "textEnd": 1230}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

While it is an illness that can be prevented, its impact is typically reduced with the aid of a vaccine.\n\nIn January and February, there were 52 cases of babies under three months being diagnosed with pertussis, compared to only 48 cases last year. Typically parents are offered early immunisations for their baby when they are eight weeks old with further doses at the 12 and 16-month mark.\n\n\"Most of our admissions are still in the pre-immunisation under-three-month group,\" Dr \u00adRonny Cheung told MailOnline. \"I've seen these babies in my practice where they come with coughing bouts, apnoea [pauses in breathing] or looking very dusky [i.e. blue] or \u00addesaturating [with low oxygen levels], and that's very worrying.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt we've been seeing quite a lot more of it on the wards and A&E in recent times,\" the doctor added. \"My suspicion is we're \u00adprobably still underestimating the true prevalence at the moment.\"\n\nCatherine Hughes shared the heart-breaking details about how her son Riley suffered from the illness. \"Riley was screaming and screaming,\" she told MailOnline. \"He would have been in a lot of pain from the needles and \u00adcannulas they were \u00adadministering. That's how my baby will last remember the world.\" Otherwise healthy Riley died from pertussis in 2015 aged just 32 days.\n\nPertussis is a bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes. According to the NHS it can spread very easily and can sometimes cause serious problems in some people, including babies.\n\nSymptoms of pertussis in children can include:\n\nGetting coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night They may make a \"whoop\" sound - a gasp for breath between coughs (young babies and some adults may not \"whoop\") They may have difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants) They may bring up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit They may become very red in the face (more common in adults)\n\nThe cough could last for several weeks or even months. If you suspect your baby or child has pertussis, ask for an urgent GP appointment.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, the UK Health Security Agency, one baby died from pertussis in the last quarter of 2023. Dozens of babies used to die from the illness each year before the vaccines were made readily available.\n\nBut vaccination rates are down, the publication reported. In September 2023 the number of two-year-olds who completed the vaccine schedule against pertussis was 92.9 per cent, down from 96.3 in 2014.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anders_anglesey@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Anders Anglesey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypoxia (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apnea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children_and_Adolescents", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children and Adolescents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32755363.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Baby-girl-3-5-months-having-vaccine-injected-in-arm-with-syringe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Vaccination coverage\", as in Portugal.\n\nThe General Directorate of Public Security said that in 2023, \"vaccination coverage for the fifth dose of the combination vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis reached 95%, and it is estimated that 85% of eligible pregnant women will be vaccinated.\"\n\nThe European Center for Disease Control and Prevention's statement quoted the European Health Commissioner as saying, \"The increase in the number of whooping cough cases across Europe shows the need to be vigilant. It is a serious disease, especially in children.\"\n\nStella Kyriakides noted that there are \"safe and effective vaccines\" to prevent the disease and that \"vaccination is the main tool to help save lives and prevent the disease from spreading further.\"\n\nAccording to the report, the increase in pertussis cases, which occurred after some years of limited spread of the disease in the EU/EEA, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, may be related to a series of factors, such as the expected epidemic peak, unvaccinated individuals or Those without up-to-date vaccinations and decreased immunity and natural boost in the general population during an epidemic.\n\nThe European Health Agency recommends that countries strengthen vaccination programs and maintain high vaccination coverage.\n\nMoreover, he adds, immunization against whooping cough during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is highly effective in preventing illness and death among newborns.\n\nMost EU/EEA countries now recommend this immunization for mothers in addition to the routine vaccination program for children.\n\nThe European Center for Disease Control and Prevention also calls for increasing \"health workers' awareness of the epidemiological situation of pertussis in their geographical area\" and knowledge of the disease, and continuing \"pertussis surveillance\", as well as ensuring capacity for early detection and diagnosis. Response and control of disease outbreaks.\n\n\"Information about whooping cough should highlight that it is a highly contagious disease and that it is essential to protect children,\" the study says.\n\nThe General Directorate of Health says that it continues to \"permanently monitor the national and international epidemiological situation, adapting its measures to the risks to which the Portuguese population is exposed,\" adding that at the beginning of May it \"sent an alert to the ULS.\" [Unidades Locais de Sa\u00fade]And private and social sector hospitals and health authorities.\n\nAmong the public health measures that will be implemented, the General Directorate of Public Security called for \"testing for possible or likely cases of whooping cough, based on nasopharyngeal secretions,\" warning of \"the necessity of vaccinating all pregnant women who meet the eligibility criteria.\"\n\nWhooping cough is transmitted through droplets of saliva expelled by sneezing or coughing and through contact with objects containing the patient's secretions.

Symptoms usually develop seven to 10 days after exposure, but can develop from four to 21 days after.\n\nSymptoms may include cold-like symptoms in the first few days of illness, severe coughing starting in the second week of illness and continuing for up to three months, gagging or vomiting after coughing episodes, difficulty getting a breath because of coughing, and coughing at night. Whooping cough can be severe in infants and children and may require hospitalization.\n\nFully immunized individuals can still become ill from pertussis, but will generally have a milder illness. They are still contagious. Students diagnosed with pertussis need to remain at home until five full days of antibiotic treatment have been completed.\n\nMost often, the illness affects older children and adults because the immunity gained from childhood immunizations decreases over time.

Bigger whooping cough epidemics are expected every 3-5 years even in countries with high vaccination rates, the ECDC said, although a slight dip in immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in the rise.\n\nEuropean countries have reported a surge in whooping cough cases in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, with 10 times as many identified as in each of the previous two years.\n\nIn total, nearly 60,000 cases were reported by European Union and European Economic Area countries over the period, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said on Wednesday, with 11 deaths in infants and eight among older adults. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial infection of the lungs and airways, and is endemic in Europe. It can be very dangerous for young babies or older people.\n\nBigger whooping cough epidemics are expected every 3-5 years even in countries with high vaccination rates, the ECDC said, although a slight dip in immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a factor in the rise. Circulation of whooping cough was also very low during the pandemic and its related restrictions on movement, making the rise seem larger. The numbers are still historically high, though. In the first three months of 2024, there have already been as many cases as there were in an average year between 2012 and 2019.\n\nThe agency noted that much of the population had missed out on natural boosting of their immunity to whooping cough because they had not been exposed to it during the pandemic. Babies under six months are at particular risk from the infection.\n\n\"It's essential to remember the lives at stake, especially our little ones. Vaccines against pertussis have proven to be safe and effective,\" said ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. Most European countries routinely immunise children against pertussis and many also vaccinate pregnant women to protect their babies. The ECDC said some countries may want to consider giving boosters to older children and adults too, as immunity can wane.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenic_bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogenic bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Ammon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Ammon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_23_10_1033124.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It's vital that vulnerable groups such as babies and pregnant women are up to date with their recommended immunisations, and that includes the pertussis vaccine. Whooping cough can be a very severe infection, potentially fatal to babies who become infected.\n\n\"Outbreaks can occur in cycles, so we tend to see these rises in cases every few years. The reasons for that are not fully understood, but population-level waning immunity is likely to contribute to that, hence why a high coverage of vaccination is so important.\n\n\"As a disease, whooping cough is as infectious as measles, and more infectious than COVID-19. This is in part due to a long period where the infected individual can be infectious, i.e. able to transmit the bacteria onto others. Thus, with a larger pool of susceptible people, there is increased likelihood of an outbreak being sustained.\"\n\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7487abed915d0e8bf19080/Pertussis_Green_Book_Chapter_24_Ap2016.pdf\n\nData on the whooping cough outbreak\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/syndromic-surveillance-weekly-summaries-for-2024\n\nInfectiousness of pertussis, https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/expert-consultation-pertussis#:~:text=Pertussis%20is%20a%20highly%20contagious,R0)%20of%2015%E2%80%9317.\n\nAs compared with e.g. measles, https://theconversation.com/measles-why-the-world-health-organization-has-declared-it-an-imminent-global-threat-195499 (COI - I wrote that Conversation article)\n\nProf Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia (UEA), said:\n\n\"This is a complex issue and I do not think we have a full understanding, but my view is that it [the rise] is a combination of factors.\n\n\"For most adults the Whooping Cough is not life threatening, though can be very unpleasant. The chronic cough can be associated with increased risk of urinary incontinence, especially in women. Other complications are uncommon. However, in young children the risk is greater, and we do need to be concerned about the risk to babies.\n\n\"The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some that are. However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old. It is this age group that are most at risk of death and developing longer term problems such as brain damage. The problem is that this age group is too young for the vaccine in most circumstances. That is why we offer vaccine to pregnant women. Not to protect them but to protect their babies during the riskiest first months of life. Vaccine uptake in pregnant women has been falling quite markedly in recent years (figure 2).\n\n\"This is a chronic repeated bouts of coughing which can be so bad that people feel it a struggle to breath in again.\n\n\"It used to be much more common in the last century up until the vaccine was introduced.

vaccine rollout making the most of the wide range of healthcare professionals who could deliver vaccines in easy to reach places.\n\n\"Specifically, to give medical and nursing students and recently retired staff a greater role to help boost declining rates, a call ministers rejected.\n\n\"In the light of today's sad news, I urge the government to rethink its approach and follow steps we have outlined to boost vaccination uptake across the country.\"\n\nSharon White, chief executive of the School and Public Health Nurses Association (SAPHNA), said the declining uptake in vaccinations reflected the shrinking of the health visiting, school nursing and public health nursing workforces seen in recent years.\n\n\"School and public health nurses are key to improving the uptake of childhood immunisations, [and] building trusting relationships with parents, children and young people, offering help, advice support, dealing with those who are contraindicated and those worried over anti-vaccination disinformation.\"\n\nVaccinations in pregnancy, often administered by nurses, offer around 92% protection from whooping cough for babies, according to the UKHSA, with childhood immunisation (as part of the six-in-one vaccine) also being key to preventing infection.\n\nThe UKHSA pointed out that uptake for both childhood and pregnancy vaccinations had \"fallen in recent years\", and highlighted the importance of it in curbing the spread.\n\nWhooping cough is a \"cyclical disease\" that usually peaks every three to five years, explained the UKHSA.\n\nThe figures suggested that the increase in whooping cough cases, which has also occurred in other countries, is the first cyclical increase since 2016.\n\nThe agency said that while vaccinations had fallen, a peak year was \"overdue\" and that the pandemic had reduced immunity in the population.\n\nUKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam added: \"Vaccination remains the best defence against whooping cough and it is vital that pregnant women and young infants receive their vaccines at the right time.\"\n\nDr Amirthalingam added: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious.\n\n\"Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nursingtimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nursing Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

New UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show there were 2,793 cases reported to the end of March.\n\nThis is compared with the 858 cases for the whole of 2023. The UKHSA said that between January and the end of March, there have been five infant deaths.\n\nREAD MORE: Major Greater Manchester hospital's outpatients, radiology department and critical care unit 'quite literally crumbling', says MP\n\n\"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious,\" said UKHSA consultant epidemiologist Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam.\n\n\"Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nIt comes as rates of childhood immunisation have been falling for the last decade, including for routine infant vaccinations such as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). The latest published data for the North West, from October to December 2023, shows almost 15% of children were not fully vaccinated with two doses against measles, mumps and rubella by the time they started school.\n\nUptake of both doses of vaccine, which is usually given to children aged one and then a second vaccine at around three years and four months, is 85.2% in the North West - and lower than 80% in some areas - which like many parts of the country is significantly lower than the World Health Organisation target of 95% coverage with two doses of MMR vaccine by five years.\n\nIn the north west, uptake of the six-in-one vaccination, which includes diphtheria, hepatitis B, Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), polio, tetanus and whooping cough (pertussis) is 94.2% which has improved on the 91.1% at the same point last year.\n\nSpeaking on the figures last month, Hayley Mercer, consultant in health protection and vaccine preventable disease lead at the UK Health Security Agency North West, said: \"Vaccination is one of the most important things we can do to give children the very best start in life. If children aren't vaccinated, they're not protected.\n\n\"It's incredibly important for children to stay up to date with routine vaccinations as this remains one of our best defences against infectious diseases like measles, not just for the person being vaccinated but for their family, friends and those around them.\n\n\"I would urge parents to check that all children are up to date with their vaccines, and if not to get them booked in as soon as possible to make sure they have maximum protection against what can be terrible diseases. Childhood vaccines also boost population immunity levels, helping prevent outbreaks, so by taking up all vaccinations for our children, we play our part in protecting us all.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helena_vesty@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Helena Vesty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MMR vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haemophilus influenzae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_schedule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination schedule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herd immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hepatitis B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diphtheria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tetanus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/health/article29031706.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_neonatal-services-under-pressure.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

This is the city's third case since late April. The Lexington-Fayette County Health Department is investigating if a possible connection exists between these cases.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness spread through coughing and sneezing, often referred to as whopping cough. It can affect people of all ages but can most seriously impact infants and those with chronic illness.\n\nFor high risk students potentially exposed, the Health Department recommends preventive antibiotics. These are students with a chronic illness or weakened immune system as well as those living in households with a family member with a chronic illness or weakened immune system, an infant, or a pregnant woman.\n\nIf any school-age children are exhibiting symptoms, they are urged to stay home and visit a healthcare provider. Early symptoms of pertussis are similar to the common cold. They include runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever and coughing. The cough gets progressively worse after 1-2 weeks, leading to coughing spells.\n\nOne dose of the booster vaccine Tdap is recommended for those 11 years of age and older. Vaccines are required for school-aged children, but teenagers and adults are encouraged to consult their health care provider about the Tdap booster.

Our Readers Have Spoken", "body": "In a recent poll conducted on our Facebook page, we asked our readers a critical question: \"Should parents vaccinate their children?\" Out of the participants, a resounding 87.5% voted in favor of vaccination, while 12.5% opposed it.\n\nThe poll sparked a lively discussion among our followers, with varied perspectives shared in the comments section. While some advocated for vaccination as a means to eradicate diseases and ensure public health, others expressed skepticism, citing concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. One commenter highlighted the potential benefits of vaccination, stating, \"If people vaccinated, we could eradicate most diseases.\" Another raised doubts about the mRNA technology used in some vaccines, while another asserted that unvaccinated children are healthier.\n\nThe poll's timing coincides with growing concerns about the resurgence of whooping cough in Bulgaria, as highlighted by Professor Iva Hristova, Director of the National Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (NCCPD). In a recent interview, Prof. Hristova emphasized the seriousness of the situation, particularly among newborns who are at risk due to delays in vaccination. The tragic cases in Kyustendil, including two infant fatalities, underscore the urgency of addressing the bacterial infection promptly.\n\nThe surge in whooping cough cases prompted Bulgaria's Health Commission to convene an emergency meeting to address the crisis. Health officials urgently mobilized to implement proactive measures, including adjustments to the immunization schedule for infants. The Ministry of Health has announced free whooping cough vaccines for pregnant women, aiming to protect vulnerable populations and curb the spread of the disease.\n\nBulgaria continues to grapple with the whooping cough outbreak, and the debate over vaccination continues to unfold. While the majority of respondents in our poll support vaccination, concerns and skepticism persist, highlighting the need for ongoing education and dialogue on this critical public health issue.", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whooping cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Messenger RNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyustendil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyustendil"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kyustendil"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2024-05/photo_verybig_225947.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542634", "eventUri": "eng-9542634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

In the first three months of this year five babies have died from the respiratory disease. The loss of any life is regrettable but it is all the more upsetting when those deaths might have been prevented.\n\nThe 2,800 cases of whooping cough in England this year represent the biggest outbreak in more than two decades. Health specialists put the rise down to a perfect storm of falling vaccination rates and weakened immunity caused by the lack of exposure during lockdown.\n\nThere is particular concern that fewer mothers-to-be are having jabs which can help protect babies. This has been accompanied by a fall in the number of children having the pre-school booster. In some places, more than a third of young people have not received the jab.\n\nEvery effort must be made to encourage parents to protect their children. Vaccinations can save their lives, and the lives of others.\n\nAct for Gaza\n\nThe crisis in Gaza is growing more intolerable by the day. Aid agencies warn of an acute shortage of food and fuel for 1.5 million people sheltering in Rafah under constant shelling.\n\nThis dire situation could become apocalyptic if Israel proceeds with its planned ground offensive. Joe Biden is threatening to withdraw US military support if Benjamin Netanyahu presses ahead with the military operation.\n\nFor the sake of humanity, Britain must follow America's lead. It is time to send a clear signal to Israel that its right to self-defence cannot include the deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n\nOlding on\n\nSprightly Ivor Ward is still clocking on for factory shifts at 98.

Parents were also told to look out for symptoms in children, including a runny nose, sore throat and a \"whooping\" noise when coughing and seek urgent medical help.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency reported 1,319 cases in England during March, which was up from 918 in February and 556 in January. There were just 858 cases of the \u00ad\"100-day cough\", which can also cause brain damage, in the whole of last year.\n\nA fall in \u00advaccinations has been blamed for a national outbreak since the turn of the year - along with \u00adweakened immunity due to a lack of social mixing in lockdowns. Latest data shows uptake of the vaccine offered to all pregnant women to protect newborns plummeted from more than 70% in 2017 to 58% last year.\n\nParents are being urged to get the jab for their children (stock image) Preventable\n\nThe number of two-year-olds who had routine six-in-one jabs, which includes whooping cough protection, fell from 96.3% in 2014 to 92.9% in 2023. The babies who died of the disease, officially called pertussis, were all under three months old and they fell ill in the first three months of this year.\n\nNHS England's Medical Director Professor Sir Stephen Powis said: \"With cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today's figures sadly showing five infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need. If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated yet, or your child is not up to date with whooping cough or other \u00advaccinations, please contact your GP as soon as possible.\"\n\nBath University's Professor Andrew Preston, who has investigated the bacteria that cause whooping cough, added: \"It is extremely sad news to hear of the deaths of five babies, especially from a vaccine-preventable disease. While no vaccine is perfect, pertussis vaccination of mums during pregnancy and of infants protects the babies and infants who are the most vulnerable to this serious and \u00adsometimes fatal disease.\n\n\"Vaccination rates in infants have declined compared to \u00adpre-pandemic levels. Uptake of the maternal booster also dropped. This results in many more young babies and infants \u00adsusceptible to infection. It is tragic to see babies dying and with cases on the rise it is vital for vaccination rates to recover.\"\n\nRoyal College of GPs chair Professor Kamila Hawthorne said: \"We would urge all parents to check their children's vaccinations, and their own, are up to date, and if they're not, to make an appointment as soon as possible. It is also important for pregnant mothers to check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if they have not been immunised.\n\n\"If you, or a member of your family, does exhibit symptoms of whooping cough, especially a heavy wheezing cough that disrupts sleep, or a change in the colour of the face, then seek medical assistance.\"\n\nEmerging infectious diseases expert Professor Paul Hunter, of the World Health Organisation and the University of East Anglia, said: \"This current year looks like we may be seeing more cases than we have seen in any of the last 40 years. The infection can affect anyone who is not vaccinated and even some who are.\n\n\"However, the main risk of death or severe long-term complications is seen in young children, especially those under three months old. It is this group that are most at risk of death and longer-term \u00adproblems such as brain damage.\" Consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam added: \"Whooping cough can affect people of all ages but for very young babies it can be extremely serious. Our thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\n\nNot all babies make the whooping sound when coughing, making the disease harder to spot. Other symptoms include coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are typically worse at night. They could be followed by difficulty in breathing.\n\nThe last peak year in 2016 had 5,949 cases in England but health chiefs fear this year will be worse. In the first three months of 2024 there have been 2,793 cases.\n\nProf Hunter said other factors making the UK vulnerable includes the fact children unvaccinated by their parents due to the MMR jab scare sparked by discredited academic Andrew Wakefield are now in their early 20s and could drive population spread.\n\nSince the whooping cough pregnancy vaccine was introduced in 2013 there have been 26 deaths in babies too young to be protected by infant jabs. Half of cases so far this year have been under 15, with the highest rates in those under three months.\n\nMy month-old girl spent 10 days in coma Kerry Pearson, 26, with her daughter Baby Polly Deehy She is now awake and breathing independently\n\nA mum whose month-old girl spent 10 days in a coma with whooping cough is urging pregnant women to have the jab. Polly Deehy had a rattly cough and laboured breathing at two weeks. After four days coughing at home last month she suddenly turned blue and parents Kerry Pearson, 26 and Jack Deehy, 29, rushed her to Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent.\n\nShe got worse and was moved to St Mary's Hospital in London where she was diagnosed with the condition and put on a ventilator. Polly is now awake and breathing independently.\n\nKerry said: \"I've never been more relieved. It was the best thing ever. There's no evidence of any lasting problems, but she might have a bit of weakness in her lungs. Time will tell. I just want people to be aware. You should have the whooping cough vaccine when you're pregnant. If you're not offered it then please demand it.\"\n\nOne-month-old Rosie Robson spent two weeks in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary\n\nThis was echoed by Molly Pickering, 25, of Co Durham, whose one-month-old Rosie Robson had two weeks in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, including time in intensive care, with the condition. Molly said she recalled being offered the vaccine while pregnant but did not think there was enough information about how awful the illness can be. She said: \"At the hospital, the woman who was looking after Rosie said they had seen nothing like this [the number of whooping cough cases].\"\n\nWhooping cough Q&A\n\nQ What should we look out for?\n\nA The UKHSA says the first signs of whooping cough infection are similar to a cold such as a runny\n\nnose and sore throat. However, after about a week, it can develop into coughing bouts lasting minutes that are worse at night. These rapid, violent and uncontrolled coughing fits can last for 10 weeks.\n\nYoung babies may make a distinctive \"whoop\" - a gasp for breath between coughs. Some babies do not cough but turn blue or struggle to breathe. And some sufferers bring up a thick mucus, which can make them vomit.\n\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England Medical Director, said: \"If you or your child show symptoms ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111.\" Anyone diagnosed with whooping cough should stay home and not attend work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics.\n\nQ Why is whooping cough so bad?\n\nA Whooping cough spreads because patients with it can be infectious of up to three weeks. It is also known as the \"100-day cough\" because of how long it can take to recover from.\n\nHalf of cases this year have been in the under-15s, with the highest rates in babies under three months of age, for whom it is particularly dangerous. The NHS says babies under six months are at increased risk of dehydration, breathing difficulties, pneumonia and seizures.\n\nQ What is causing the current UK outbreak?\n\nA Whooping cough is a cyclical disease which peaks every three to five years. Infections have surged since December 2023. The last big increase was in 2016 before the pandemic reduced social contacts so we are due a bounce back.\n\nVaccination uptake fell with rates among pregnant women down from more than 70% in 2017 to 58% in 2023. The number of two-year-olds who completed their routine six-in-one vaccinations, which includes protection against whooping cough, was 92.9% in 2023 compared with 96.3% in 2014.\n\nQ Who can get vaccinated and when?\n\nAThe NHS recommends pregnant women are vaccinated between 16 and 32 weeks. Immunity from the jab passes through the placenta to protect babies in their first weeks. When a baby is eight weeks old, they are offered the six-in-one vaccine which protects against whooping cough. More doses are offered at 12 and 16 weeks with a booster after three years.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_bagot@mirror.co.uk",

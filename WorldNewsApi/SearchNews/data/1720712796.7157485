Candidate for Surrey Heath Ed McGuinness posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday that he was \u201cnow a resident of St Paul\u2019s ward\u201d as constituents \u201crightly expect their MP to be a part of their community\u201d. He shared photos of himself holding keys in front of a front door and standing in a kitchen. However, social media users claimed the home was listed on property rental site Airbnb and a Community Note was subsequently added to the bottom of the post. Mr McGuinness told the PA news agency the property was a former Airbnb he was renting and that it had not yet been removed from the site. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a former Airbnb that I\u2019m now renting while I look to buy. \u201cTo get a place within 100 hours of being selected is a great achievement (if you know an estate agent who can work it out sooner please let me know!) and demonstrates my commitment to Surrey Heath. \u201cPresumably the landlord had it listed on Airbnb and didn\u2019t immediately remove it as soon as I moved in.\u201d The listing has since been removed from Airbnb. In his social media post announcing his new living arrangements, Mr McGuinness said: \u201cSurrey Heath residents, rightly, expect their MP to be a part of their community. \u201cWell as of today I am now a resident of St Paul\u2019s ward! \u201cAs many of you will appreciate Michael Gove stepped down with a short timeframe to select me and it\u2019s hard to get a place so quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve said in previous messages my fiance and I were moving in, and I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be more explicit on timeframes as I didn\u2019t want to jinx it, but now I am so happy to live here and honoured to stand and represent our great residents!.\u201d The Liberal Democrats have claimed that Mr McGuinness is listed as a resident of Putney in London on his nomination papers. Liberal Democrat candidate for Surrey Health Al Pinkerton told PA: \u201cFirst we had Michael Gove running scared, now we have a candidate who has overshot his parachute so much it\u2019s landed in Putney. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to offer the Conservatives\u2019 Putney candidate a walking tour of our constituency so he can get properly acquainted. \u201cPeople across Surrey Heath and more widely across our country deserve so much better than these embarrassing Conservatives who are taking voters for granted.\u201d", "summary": "Candidate for Surrey Heath Ed McGuinness posted on social media that he was a new \u2018resident\u2019 of the constituency.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/airbnb-michael-gove-liberal-democrat-people-putney-b1163169.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/18/09173436-cae86481-295e-46e2-9684-7c6b19f531a9.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:16:29", "author": "Aisling Grace", "authors": ["Aisling Grace"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.469}

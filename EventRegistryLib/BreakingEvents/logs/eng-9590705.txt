Ireland, Norway and Spain said they would formally recognise the State of Palestine, May 28, drawing praises from Palestinian leaders as well as many countries in the Arab and Muslim world, and fury from Israel. AFP-Yonhap\n\nNorway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they would recognize a Palestinian state, a historic but largely symbolic move that further deepens Israel's isolation more than seven months into its grinding war against Hamas in Gaza . Israel denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip -- territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and still controls.\n\nWhile some 140 countries -- more than two-thirds of the United Nations -- recognize a Palestinian state, Wednesday's cascade of announcements could build momentum at a time when even close allies of Israel have piled on criticism for its conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state. Proponents have argued that the war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied .\n\nIn addition to recalling the ambassadors to the three countries, Israel summoned their envoys, accusing the Europeans of rewarding the militant Hamas group for its Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the European ambassadors would watch grisly video footage of the attack .\n\nIn that assault, Hamas-led militants stormed across the border, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The ICC prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and has caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor has accused Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" Katz said.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\n\"We will not even allow a statement about a Palestinian state,\" he said.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop tra\n\nnsferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, a move that threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nThe Spanish and European Union flags flutter on the consulate of Spain building in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, May 22. AFP-Yonhap\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA. Smotrich said Wednesday that he was ending that arrangement.\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community has viewed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians, while long advocating for a Palestinian state -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first. \"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority , which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines , at least on an interim basis. Israel says any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Israelis. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nNetanyahu has said Israel will maintain security control of Gaza even after any defeat of Hamas, and the war is still raging there. An Israeli airstrike early Wednesday killed 10 people, including four women and four children, who had been displaced and were sheltering in central Gaza, according to hospital authorities.\n\nHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said \"recognition is a tangible step towards a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination.\"\n\nTo have an impact, he said, it must come with \"tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory - such as banning settlement products and financial services.\"\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide defended the importance of the move in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that while the country has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state for decades, it knew that recognition is \"a card that you can play once.\"\n\n\"We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process,\" he said. \"Now we have realized that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [],

This recognition is not against anyone, it is in favour of peace and coexistence.\"\n\nIsrael reacted to the announcements with fury.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the move by Ireland, Norway and Spain as a \"reward for terrorism\" and said it would not bring peace.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz said he was ordering the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors to all three countries for \"consultations\".\n\n\"Israel will not go over this in silence - there will be other serious consequences,\" he said.\n\nKatz also said that the three countries' ambassadors in Israel will be summoned for \"reprimand talks\", during which they will be shown a video of the abduction of female Israeli soldiers on 7 October.\n\nHamas, which controls Gaza and is currently at war with Israel, said Wednesday's announcements would be a \"turning point in the international position on the Palestinian issue\".\n\nIn a statement to AFP, Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas figure, said the \"brave resistance\" of the Palestinian people was behind the move.\n\nHamas's rival, the Palestinian Authority (PA) - which controls parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said Norway, Spain and Ireland had demonstrated their \"unwavering commitment\" to \"delivering the long overdue justice to the Palestinian people\".\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Israeli military approved the return of Israeli citizens to the sites of three settlements in the occupied West Bank, which they had been banned from entering since 2005.\n\nIsrael's parliament had voted to allow its citizens to return in March last year, but military permission was needed for the bill to be enforced.\n\nMost of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\nThe issue of Palestinian statehood has vexed the international community for decades.\n\nSince the 7 October attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down on his opposition to such a plan, saying the creation of a Palestinian state would compromise Israel's security.\n\nAbout 1200 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen burst into Israel. They took 252 others back to Gaza as hostages.\n\nSince then, more than 35,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Israel's Gaza offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nMost of the world already recognises the state of Palestine. Earlier this month, 143 of the 193 members of the United Nations General Assembly voted in favour of it joining the UN, something only states can do.\n\nBefore Wednesday's announcements, only nine European countries supported Palestinian statehood and most of those took the decision in 1988 when they were part of the Soviet bloc.\n\nMost other European countries, and the US, still believe recognition should come only as part of a long-term two-state solution to the conflict.\n\nA White House spokesperson said US President Joe Biden was a \"strong supporter\" of the two-state solution, and believed \"a Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations, not through unilateral recognition\".\n\nSlovenia and Malta have also said recently that they were considering a formal recognition.\n\nNorway's prime minister also said on Wednesday that he hoped the recognition of Palestinian statehood by the three countries would bring renewed momentum to the peace talks.\n\nLong-running negotiations in Cairo aimed at securing a truce and further hostage releases are currently stalled.\n\nMeanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Earlier this week, the UN said food distribution in the southern Gaza city of Rafah had been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity.\n\nThe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) recently applied for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes. Both Israel and Hamas have condemned the move.\n\nIsrael says an offensive in Rafah is needed to eliminate Hamas but the international community has warned against it, saying it will greatly exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

It would try to carry out the October 7 massacre again and again - and that, we shall not agree to,\" he said.\n\n\"Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace and neither will it stop us from defeating Hamas.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision would carry \"severe consequences,\" and ordered the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors from the three countries for consultations.\n\nPalestinians welcome announcement\n\nThe decision by the three European countries was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank, and by Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since driving the PA out of the enclave in 2007.\n\nAbout 144 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations recognize Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said, today, that the country's council of ministers would recognize an independent Palestinian state on May 28.\n\nDUBLIN/OSLO/MADRID >> Ireland, Spain and Norway announced on Wednesday that they would recognize a Palestinian state on May 28, prompting an angry response from Israel which said this amounted to a \"reward for terrorism\" and recalled its ambassadors from the three capitals.\n\nDublin, Madrid and Oslo painted the decision as a move aimed at accelerating efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThey urged other countries to follow suit although the United States, Israel's main ally, stood by its position that a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations and not \"unilateral recognition\".\n\n\"We hope that our recognition and our reasons contribute to other Western countries following this path, because the more we are, the more strength we will have to impose a ceasefire, to achieve the release of the hostages held by Hamas, to relaunch the political process that can lead to a peace agreement,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told parliament.\n\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the only possible political solution between Israelis and Palestinians was \"two states living side by side in peace and security\".\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth Eide said he did not expect the recognition to stop the war in Gaza, but it was \"a key component\" for an Arab-led peace initiative.\n\nIreland's Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Dublin press conference that Ireland remained unequivocal in recognizing Israel's right to exist \"securely and in peace with its neighbours\", and called for all hostages in Gaza to be freed.\n\nThe decision infuriated Israel, which says recognizing a Palestinian state amounts to rewarding Hamas militants for the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's offensive against the Palestinian militant group in Gaza.\n\n\"The intention of several European countries to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n\"This would be a terrorist state. It would try to carry out the October 7 massacre again and again - and that, we shall not agree to,\" he said.\n\n\"Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace and neither will it stop us from defeating Hamas.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision would carry \"severe consequences\", and ordered the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors from the three countries for consultations.\n\nPALESTINIANS WELCOME STATEHOOD ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nThe decision by the three European countries was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and by Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since driving the PA out of the enclave in 2007.\n\nAbout 144 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations recognise Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India. But only a handful of the 27 European Union members have done so, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and Cyprus.\n\nBritain, Australia and EU members Malta and Slovenia have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit.\n\nNorway, which is not an EU member, was the host of the Oslo peace process some 30 years ago that was intended to lead to a Palestinian state on territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war, including the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.

Israel immediately denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip -- territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and still controls.\n\nSome 140 countries -- more than two-thirds of the United Nations -- recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nThe timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nProponents have argued that the Israel-Hamas war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIn addition to recalling the ambassadors to the three countries, Israel summoned their envoys, accusing the Europeans of rewarding the terrorist Hamas group for its Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the European ambassadors would watch grisly video footage of the attack.\n\nIn that assault, Hamas-led terrorists stormed across the border, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" Katz said.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians. After the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA. Smotrich said Wednesday that he was ending that arrangement.\n\nThe international community has long viewed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians, while long advocating for a Palestinian state -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first. \"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel says any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas terrorists, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Israelis. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nNetanyahu has said Israel will maintain security control of Gaza even after any defeat of Hamas, and the war is still raging there.\n\nHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said \"recognition is a tangible step towards a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination.\"\n\nTo have an impact, he said, it must come with \"tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory -- such as banning settlement products and financial services.\"\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide defended the importance of the move in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that while the country has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state for decades, it knew that recognition is \"a card that you can play once.\"\n\n\"We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process,\" he said. \"Now we have realized that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.\"", "source": {"uri":

Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz has ordered Israel's ambassadors from Ireland and Norway to immediately return to Israel, as Norway said it would recognize a Palestinian state and Ireland was expected to do the same. (Erik Flaaris Johansen/NTB Scanpix via AP) Advertisement\n\nNorway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they would recognize a Palestinian state, a historic but largely symbolic move that further deepens Israel's isolation more than seven months into its grinding war against Hamas in Gaza. Israel immediately denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip -- territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and still controls.\n\nWhile some 140 countries -- more than two-thirds of the United Nations -- recognize a Palestinian state, Wednesday's cascade of announcements could build momentum at a time when even close allies of Israel have piled on criticism for its conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state. Proponents have argued that the war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nIn addition to recalling the ambassadors to the three countries, Israel summoned their envoys, accusing the Europeans of rewarding the militant Hamas group for its Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the European ambassadors would watch grisly video footage of the attack.\n\nIn that assault, Hamas-led militants stormed across the border, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The ICC prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and has caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor has accused Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" Katz said.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. The move could escalate tensions across the region.\n\n\"We will not even allow a statement about a Palestinian state,\" he said.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, a move that threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA. Smotrich said Wednesday that he was ending that arrangement.\n\nThe international community has long viewed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Canada abstains on Palestine recognition at UN\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians, while long advocating for a Palestinian state -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first. \"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel says any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Israelis. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nNetanyahu has said Israel will maintain security control of Gaza even after any defeat of Hamas, and the war is still raging there. An Israeli airstrike early Wednesday killed 10 people, including four women and four children, who had been displaced and were sheltering in central Gaza, according to hospital authorities.\n\nHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said \"recognition is a tangible step towards a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination.\"\n\nTo have an impact, he said, it must come with \"tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory - such as banning settlement products and financial services.\"\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide defended the importance of the move in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that while the country has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state for decades, it knew that recognition is \"a card that you can play once.\"\n\n\"We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process,\" he said. \"Now we have realized that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: Israeli and Hamas leaders join list of people accused by war crimes court\n\n___\n\nWilson reported from Barcelona, Spain, and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The countries were sending a message that \"terrorism pays\".\n\nAround 140 nations already recognise a Palestinian state, but very few in Europe have. Among them are Hungary and Sweden.\n\n\"This is a historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told reporters on Wednesday morning. \"It is an expression of our view that Palestine holds and should be able to vindicate the full rights to the state, including self-determination, self-governance, territorial integrity and security.\"\n\nIreland, Norway and Spain plan to formally recognise a Palestinian state -- comprising Gaza and the West Bank -- on May 28.\n\nHarris and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez reiterated calls for an end to the war in Gaza which is now in its eighth month and has devastated the Mediterranean enclave. They and Norway have been among the European countries most critical of Israel for continuing the conflict.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war is necessary to destroy Hamas, designated a terrorist organisation by the US and European Union.\n\nNetanyahu has spent most of his life rejecting a Palestinian state, although in 2009 he said he'd accept a demilitarised one as long as the Palestinians recognized Israel as a Jewish state. The Palestinian leadership rejected that, and in recent years, Netanyahu and the Israeli public have stepped away from supporting two states.\n\nThis is due to the growth of religious nationalism in Israel and a sense that violent forces like Hamas would push aside more moderate parties in any Palestinian country. In addition, the refusal by the Palestinian Authority -- which runs parts of the West Bank -- to properly condemn Hamas' attack of 7 October, which started the war, has solidified those concerns.\n\nIsrael controls many aspects of security in Gaza and the West Bank, including their air space. Its officials fear losing those powers if the Palestinians get an independent country and have argued that they would have far less ability to prevent 7 October-style assaults in the future.\n\nThe US, Israel's most important ally, backs a two-state solution but says it can only come about through negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. In recent months, President Joe Biden has signalled a state of Palestine could be created with strict limits on its military forces so as to reassure Israel.\n\nFrance's government said that while \"recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo\" it did not yet think \"conditions have been met for this decision to have a real impact\",\n\nThe decision by Ireland, Norway and Spain was praised by both the PA and Hamas, which nominally governs Gaza.\n\nThe PA said the recognitions were \"in line with international law,\" while Hamas said they were \"an important step on the path of affirming our right to our land and an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital\".\n\nSanchez stressed the decision was about \"peace\" and not made against Israel or in favour of Hamas. The Iran-backed organisation was a \"terrorist group that must disappear\", he said.\n\nIrish foreign minister Micheal Martin made similar comments, saying it should not be \"misrepresented as a hostile act\" toward Israel.\n\nThe conflict began when Hamas fighters swarmed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. Since then, Israel's air and ground offensive on Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nBy recognising Palestinian statehood, Norway may have closed the door on its historic role as a mediator in the Middle East.\n\nThe country's emphasis on being able to speak to both sides in the long-running dispute is symbolised by the 1993 peace accords signed in Oslo. That \"interim\" arrangement -- now more than 30 years old -- serves as a reminder of its attempts to forge a permanent resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nBut after Norway announced on Wednesday that it would officially recognise Palestinian statehood -- in coordination with some other European nations -- Israel recalled its ambassador.\n\n\"With this symbolic action which has no real meaning, the government has completely played Norway out of its role as a potential peace broker in this conflict,\" Sylvi Listhaug, the leader of the opposition Progress Party, said in an interview with VG newspaper.\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said the government still wanted \"close contact\" with Israel, and remained \"a friend\" of the Middle Eastern nation, according to the public broadcaster NRK.\n\n\"We can no longer wait for the conflict to be resolved before we recognise the state of Palestine,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store told a news conference in Oslo, as Irish and Spanish government officials delivered similar announcements. \"A Palestinian state is a prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Norway was instrumental in the secret negotiations that led to the creation of the Palestinian National Authority -- the government body that was driven out of Gaza by Hamas in 2006 -- it hasn't been able to spur any real progress toward peace in decades.\n\nStill, the nation \"has taken a leading role in mobilising European support\" for a peace plan put forward by Israel's Arab neighbours in the wake of the 7 October attacks, the government said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. The country also hoped to \"make some major progress\" at a meeting that's taking place in Brussels later this month.\n\nThe Houthi militants in Yemen have weapons that can reach as far as the Mediterranean Sea, according to a senior US defence official, lending some credence to the group's threats that it can expand its attacks on shipping beyond its immediate borders.\n\nThe US government is concerned that the Iran-backed group has the capability to extend strikes on shipping beyond the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to the Mediterranean, said the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss private talks.\n\nThe official said Houthis had access to advanced weaponry and that their deployment of anti-ship ballistic missiles was virtually unprecedented. The group has also used drones in its attacks.\n\nThe assessment came as defence officials from the US and the Gulf Cooperation Council met on Wednesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Houthis earlier this month said they would expand their range to vessels in the eastern Mediterranean. The organisation began the attacks as a show of solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza war.\n\nThe Houthis have threatened vessels associated with Israel, the US and the UK since October, effectively closing the southern Red Sea to most Western ships. Shipping and freight executives increasingly think it will remain too dangerous for many more months, forcing them to skip the Suez Canal and go around southern Africa.\n\nThe Houthis receive military training and intelligence and radar support from Iran, which is crucial when targeting moving objects such as ships.\n\nThe US has softened its earlier resistance to a broader Israeli military operation in Rafah following efforts by Israel to reduce the civilian toll of the assault, a US official said.\n\nThe shift followed weeks of warnings by President Joe Biden that a full-scale attack on the Gaza Strip border city where hundreds of thousands have taken shelter would prompt the US to suspend the transfer of offensive weapons to Israel.\n\nBut when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and other top White House aides met with senior Israeli officials in recent days, they found that Israel had incorporated US humanitarian concerns into their plans, the US official said, requesting anonymity to discuss matters that aren't public. The departure of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Rafah in recent weeks also helped allay concerns about the civilian toll of an assault, the official said.\n\nAny sustained incursion is still likely to pose a political challenge for Biden, who has come under fire from progressives in his own party for his steadfast support of Israel despite mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. Earlier this month, Biden said in an interview with CNN that he would cut off the shipment of offensive weapons including artillery shells if Israel proceeded with an operation in the city, where Palestinian refugees have gathered following sustained bombing in other areas of Gaza.\n\nThe official did not detail the extent of Israeli operations that would be acceptable to the White House, and Biden has already said he was not concerned by limited efforts on the outskirts of the city. Ultimately, the US would evaluate any operation on the way it was carried out and Washington does not greenlight Israeli military actions, the official said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted the \"pretty large exodus of people from Rafah\" but said the US remained \"very concerned about any major military operation and the impact it would have on the remaining population, given the dense urban environment in Rafah\".

They urged other countries to follow suit although the United States, Israel's main ally, stood by its position that a Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations and not \"unilateral recognition\".\n\n\"We hope that our recognition and our reasons contribute to other western countries following this path, because the more we are, the more strength we will have to impose a ceasefire, to achieve the release of the hostages held by Hamas, to relaunch the political process that can lead to a peace agreement,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told parliament. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the only possible political solution between Israelis and Palestinians was \"two states living side by side in peace and security\".\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth Eide said he did not expect the recognition to stop the war in Gaza, but it was \"a key component\" for an Arab-led peace initiative. Ireland's Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Dublin press conference that Ireland remained unequivocal in recognising Israel's right to exist \"securely and in peace with its neighbours\", and called for all hostages in Gaza to be freed.\n\nThe decision infuriated Israel, which says recognising a Palestinian state amounts to rewarding Hamas militants for the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's offensive against the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. \"The intention of several European countries to recognize a Palestinian state is a reward for terrorism,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n\"This would be a terrorist state. It would try to carry out the October 7 massacre again and again - and that, we shall not agree to,\" he said. \"Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace and neither will it stop us from defeating Hamas.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision would carry \"severe consequences\", and ordered the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors from the three countries for consultations. PALESTINIANS WELCOME STATEHOOD ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nThe decision by the three European countries was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank, and by Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since driving the PA out of the enclave in 2007. About 144 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations recognise Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India. But only a handful of the 27 European Union members have done so, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and Cyprus.\n\nBritain, Australia and EU members Malta and Slovenia have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit. Norway, which is not an EU member, was the host of the Oslo peace process some 30 years ago that was intended to lead to a Palestinian state on territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war, including the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. The last negotiations collapsed a decade ago.\n\nNetanyahu has rejected a sovereign Palestinian state, despite the so-called \"two-state solution\" remaining the U.S. policy objective. Washington, however, opposes recognising Palestine without an agreement reached at negotiations. President Joe Biden \"is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career,\" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said. \"He believes a Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"\n\nGermany said it was a matter that required further dialogue, while France said conditions had not yet been met. Last month, Washington vetoed recognising Palestine as a state at the United Nations, where the Palestinians now have observer status.\n\nThe move by the three European countries was the latest example of Israel's increasing international isolation, both over the civilian casualties resulting from its tactics in the Gaza war, as well as its over longstanding policies such as building Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. Jan Egeland, who was part of the Norwegian diplomatic team that helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords in the 1990s, said the announcement by the European trio, though \"symbolic\", was a message to Israel that the occupation of Palestinian territories had to end.\n\nAlon Liel, a former director general of Israel's foreign ministry and a critic of Netanyahu's government, told Reuters by phone from Tel Aviv that the move by Spain, Ireland and Norway could have an important impact on Israeli public opinion. Equalising the status of Israel and Palestine in the international sphere, was \"a nightmare for the current Israeli leadership\", he said. The three European countries' action represented \"the start of the recognition by the countries that Israel cares about, that are a role model for Israel\".\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas in which fighters killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's operations in the enclave have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

Israel immediately denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in east Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip - territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and still controls.\n\nWhile some 140 countries - more than two-thirds of the United Nations - recognize a Palestinian state, the cascade on May 22 of announcements could build momentum at a time when even close allies of Israel have piled on criticism for its conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state. Proponents have argued that the war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Mr. Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nIn addition to recalling the ambassadors to the three countries, Israel summoned their envoys, accusing the Europeans of rewarding the militant Hamas group for its Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the European ambassadors would watch grisly video footage of the attack.\n\nIn that assault, Hamas-led militants stormed across the border, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The ICC prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and has caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor has accused Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" Mr. Katz said.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit May 22 to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound - a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. The move could escalate tensions across the region.\n\n\"We will not even allow a statement about a Palestinian state,\" he said.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority (PA), a move that threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Mr. Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA. Mr. Smotrich said May 22 that he was ending that arrangement.\n\nThe international community has long viewed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Mr. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain, and Ireland - which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians, while long advocating for a Palestinian state - is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first. \"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" Mr. S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice, and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel says any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza - or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Israelis. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain security control of Gaza even after any defeat of Hamas, and the war is still raging there. An Israeli airstrike early on May 22 killed 10 people, including four women and four children, who had been displaced and were sheltering in central Gaza, according to hospital authorities.\n\nHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said \"recognition is a tangible step towards a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination.\"\n\nTo have an impact, he said, it must come with \"tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory - such as banning settlement products and financial services.\"\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide defended the importance of the move in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that while the country has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state for decades, it knew that recognition is \"a card that you can play once.\"\n\n\"We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process,\" he said. \"Now we have realized that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors":

I have just ordered the return of the Israeli ambassadors from Dublin and Oslo to Israel for further consultations in Jerusalem,\" Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.\n\nSanchez said in March that Spain and Ireland, along with Slovenia and Malta, had agreed to take their first steps toward Palestinian recognition, seeing a two-state solution as essential for lasting peace.\n\nThe efforts come as a mounting death toll in Gaza from Israel's offensive to rout Hamas prompts calls globally for a ceasefire and lasting solution for peace in the region.\n\nNorway, which is not a member of the European Union but mirror its moves, has been an ardent supporter of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\n\"The terror has been committed by Hamas and militant groups who are not supporters of a two-state solution and the state of Israel,\" the Norwegian government leader said.\n\n\"Palestine has a fundamental right to an independent state,\" Gahr Store told a press conference.\n\nThe move comes as Israeli forces have led assaults on the northern and southern edges of the Gaza Strip in May, causing a new exodus of hundreds of thousands of people, and sharply restricted the flow of aid, raising the risk of famine.\n\nThe Scandinavian country \"will therefore regard Palestine as an independent state with all the rights and obligations that entails,\" Gahr Store said.\n\nNorway's recognition of a Palestine state comes more than 30 years after the first Oslo agreement was signed in 1993.\n\nSince then, \"the Palestinians have taken important steps toward a two-state solution,\" the Norwegian government said.\n\nIt said that the World Bank determined that Palestine had met key criteria to function as a state in 2011, that national institutions have been built up to provide the population with important services.\n\n\"The war in Gaza and the constant expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank still mean that the situation in Palestine is more difficult than it has been in decades,\" the Norwegian government said.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [],

It would try to carry out the October 7 massacre again and again - and that, we shall not agree to,\" he said.\n\n\"Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace and neither will it stop us from defeating Hamas.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision would carry \"severe consequences\" and ordered the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors from the three countries for consultations.\n\nThe decision by the three European countries was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank, and by Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since driving the PA out of the enclave in 2007.\n\nAbout 144 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations recognise Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India.\n\nBut only a handful of the 27 European Union members have done so, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and Cyprus.\n\nThe United Kingdom, Australia and EU members Malta and Slovenia have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit.\n\nNorway, which is not an EU member, was the host of the Oslo peace process 30 years ago that was intended to lead to a Palestinian state on territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war including the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.\n\nThe last negotiations collapsed a decade ago.\n\nNetanyahu has rejected a sovereign Palestinian state, despite the so-called \"two-state solution\" remaining the US policy objective.\n\nThe US, however, opposes recognising Palestine without an agreement reached at negotiations.\n\nUS President Joe Biden \"is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career,\" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said.\n\n\"He believes a Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"\n\nGermany said it was a matter that required further dialogue while France said conditions had not yet been met.\n\nLast month, the US vetoed recognising Palestine as a state at the United Nations, where the Palestinians now have observer status.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [],

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community views the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melanie_lidman@omaha.com",

The countries are sending a message that \"terrorism pays.\"\n\nAround 140 nations already recognize a Palestinian state, but very few in Europe have. Among them are Hungary and Sweden.\n\n\"This is an historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told reporters on Wednesday morning. \"It is an expression of our view that Palestine holds and should be able to vindicate the full rights to the state, including self determination, self governance, territorial integrity and security.\"\n\nIreland, Norway and Spain plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state -- comprising Gaza and the West Bank -- on May 28.\n\nHarris and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez reiterated calls for an end to the war in Gaza that's now in its eighth month and which has devastated the Mediterranean enclave. They and Norway have been among the European countries most critical of Israel for continuing the conflict.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war is necessary to destroy Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union.\n\nNetanyahu has spent most of his life rejecting a Palestinian state, although in 2009 he said he'd accept a demilitarized one as long as the Palestinians recognized Israel as a Jewish state. The Palestinian leadership rejected that, and in recent years, Netanyahu and the Israeli public have stepped away from supporting two states.\n\nThis is due to the growth of religious nationalism in Israel and a sense that violent forces like Hamas would push aside more moderate parties in any Palestinian country. In addition, the refusal by the Palestinian Authority -- which runs parts of the West Bank -- to properly condemn Hamas's attack of Oct. 7, which started the war, have solidified those concerns.\n\nIsrael controls many aspects of security in Gaza and the West Bank, including their air space. It officials fear losing those powers if the Palestinians get an independent country and have argued that they would have far less ability to prevent Oct. 7-style assaults in the future.\n\nUS Backs Negotiations\n\nThe U.S., Israel's most important ally, backs a two-state solution, but says it can only come about through negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. In recent months, President Joe Biden's signaled a state of Palestine could be created with strict limits on its military forces so as to reassure Israel.\n\nFrance's government said that while \"recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo,\" it does not yet think \"conditions have been met for this decision to have a real impact.\"\n\nThe decision by Ireland, Norway and Spain was praised by both the PA and Hamas, which nominally governs Gaza.\n\nThe PA said the recognitions are \"in line with international law,\" while Hamas said it was \"an important step on the path of affirming our right to our land and an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"\n\nSanchez stressed the decision was about \"peace\" and not made against Israel or in favor of Hamas. The Iran-backed organization is a \"terrorist group that must disappear,\" he said.\n\nIrish foreign minister Micheal Martin made similar comments, saying it should not be \"misrepresented as a hostile act\" toward Israel.\n\nThe conflict began when Hamas fighters swarmed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's air and ground offensive on Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nHarris and Sanchez held bilateral talks in Dublin last month and reiterated their intention build international support for a two-state solution.\n\nIn March, the leaders of Slovenia, Malta, Spain and Ireland met in Brussels. They issued a joint statement saying Palestinian statehood was \"the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region.\"\n\nIreland's position had already led to tensions with Israel. Harris discussed the plan with Israeli president Isaac Herzog in a phone call on Sunday. Harris insisted he did not want to see Ireland's diplomatic relations with Israel severed.\n\nRelations between Israel and Spain have been tense too. In November, Israel recalled its ambassador to Madrid after Sanchez said he had serious doubts Israel was complying with international law. He told Netanyahu that the number of deaths in Gaza was \"unbearable,\" adding that Spain also suffered terrorism in the past and it can't be stopped by force alone.", "source": {"uri":

It would try to carry out the October 7 massacre again and again - and that, we shall not agree to,\" he said.\n\n\"Rewarding terrorism will not bring peace and neither will it stop us from defeating Hamas.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision would carry \"severe consequences\" and ordered the immediate return of the Israeli ambassadors from the three countries for consultations.\n\nThe decision by the three European countries was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank, and by Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since driving the PA out of the enclave in 2007.\n\nAbout 144 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations recognise Palestine as a state, including most of the global south, Russia, China and India.\n\nBut only a handful of the 27 European Union members have done so, mostly former Communist countries as well as Sweden and Cyprus.\n\nThe United Kingdom, Australia and EU members Malta and Slovenia have indicated in recent months that they could soon follow suit.\n\nNorway, which is not an EU member, was the host of the Oslo peace process 30 years ago that was intended to lead to a Palestinian state on territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war including the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.\n\nThe last negotiations collapsed a decade ago.\n\nNetanyahu has rejected a sovereign Palestinian state, despite the so-called \"two-state solution\" remaining the US policy objective.\n\nThe US, however, opposes recognising Palestine without an agreement reached at negotiations.\n\nUS President Joe Biden \"is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career,\" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said.\n\n\"He believes a Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"\n\nGermany said it was a matter that required further dialogue while France said conditions had not yet been met.\n\nLast month, the US vetoed recognising Palestine as a state at the United Nations, where the Palestinians now have observer

Getty Images/PA/Reuters\n\nWARNING: This story contains graphic video and descriptions of women being violently taken hostage as well as discussion of sexual assault.\n\nNorway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they would recognize a Palestinian state, a historic but largely symbolic move that further deepens Israel's isolation more than seven months into its grinding war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip -- territories that Israel seized in the 1967 Six-Day War and still largely controls.\n\nIsrael immediately denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.\n\nWhile some 140 countries -- more than two-thirds of the United Nations -- recognize a Palestinian state, Wednesday's cascade of announcements could build momentum at a time when even close allies of Israel have piled on criticism for its conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state. Proponents have argued that the war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nNorway, which is not a member of the EU but mirrors its moves, has been an ardent supporter of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. The country helped broker the Oslo accords during the peace process in the 1990s.\n\n\"The terror has been committed by Hamas and militant groups who are not supporters of a two-state solution and the state of Israel,\" Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said. \"Palestine has a fundamental right to an independent state.\"\n\nIn making his announcement Wednesday, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said the move was co-ordinated with Spain and Norway -- and that it was a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine.\"\n\n'Not against the Israeli people'\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez made the expected announcement to the nation's parliament. He had spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for the recognition, as well as for a possible cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" said Sanchez, while acknowledging that it will most likely cause diplomatic tensions with Israel. \"It is an act in favour of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nSanchez argued that the move is needed to support the viability of a two-state solution that he said \"is in serious danger\" with the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's government harshly condemned the decision taken by the three countries.\n\nIn addition to recalling its ambassadors from the three countries and summoned their envoys in Israel, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on social media the ambassadors from the three countries \"will watch a video of the brutal and cruel kidnapping of our daughters by Hamas terrorists, to emphasize the distorted decision their governments have made. \"\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" he said. He also said the announcement would undermine talks aimed at a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza that came to a standstill earlier this month.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders over the assault it led on Israel on Oct. 7, which Israel has said saw 1,200 killed and some 250 taken hostage. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and has caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor has accused Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nThis month, Israeli forces have led assaults on the northern and southern edges of the Gaza Strip in May, causing a new exodus of hundreds of thousands of people, and sharply restricted the flow of aid.\n\nAbbas, Hamas praise decision\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking after Norway's announcement, welcomed the move and called on other countries to follow.\n\nIn a statement carried by the official Wafa news agency, Abbas said Norway's decision will enshrine \"the Palestinian people's right to self-determination\" and support efforts to bring about a two-state solution with Israel.\n\nHamas also welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights.\" Hamas, which Western countries including Canada view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the ground. Israel annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the three million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule. In Gaza, the war is still raging, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control of the territory even after any defeat of Hamas.\n\nRecognition in most countries\n\nThe move Wednesday could put more pressure on continental heavyweights France and Germany to reconsider their position.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel as a solution to the Middle East's most intractable conflict. They insist, however, that Palestinian independence should come as part of a negotiated settlement.\n\n\"The president is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career,\" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said. \"He believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"\n\nIn Ottawa, a non-binding motion concerning Palestinian statehood introduced by the NDP was carried 204 to 117 in March. It passed after a Liberal government amendment stipulating that Canada will \"work with international partners\" to \"pursue the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East,\" and work \"towards the establishment of the State of Palestine as part of a negotiated two-state solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "hiiraan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hiiraan Online"},

The situation in the Middle East has not been this grave for many years.\"\n\nIsrael quickly denounced the diplomatic declarations by the three countries, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring that Hamas had won a \"prize for terrorism.\"\n\nHe said a Palestinian nation \"would be a terrorist state. It would try to carry out the October 7 massacre again and again - and that, we shall not agree to.\"\n\nNorway said there is broad international consensus about the need for a two-state solution, including an overwhelming vote at the U.N. General Assembly this month to recognize the Palestinians as qualified to join the world body.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the decision was based on \"peace, justice and coherence.\"\n\n\"Time has come to move from words into action,\" Sanchez said.\n\nThe three countries said their recognition of Palestinian statehood will take effect May 28.\n\nRiyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, called it \"a wonderful moment.... This European wave, hopefully, will be followed by other waves.\"\n\nIn Washington, the White House National Security Council said President Joe Biden \"is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career.\"\n\nHowever, it said Biden \"believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz immediately announced the recall of Israel's ambassadors from all three countries that recognized a Palestinian state.\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" Katz said.\n\nKatz said recognizing a Palestinian state is a reward to Hamas and Iran, and an \"injustice to the memory\" of those killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's subsequent seven-month counter-offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 civilians and combatants, although the Gaza Health Ministry says most of the dead are women and children.\n\n\"Israel will not remain silent in the face of those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security,\" Katz said.\n\nIreland's prime minister, Simon Harris, said Ireland unequivocally recognizes Israel and its right to exist \"securely and in peace with its neighbors.\" Harris called for all the hostages currently being held by Hamas in Gaza to be released.\n\nHarris pointed to Ireland's own history and the importance of getting recognition from other nations.\n\nThe vision for a Palestinian state put forward by Norway is not one led by the Hamas militants who have ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, but one derived from the Palestinian Authority in charge of parts of the West Bank.\n\nNorway's St\u00f8re said the situation in the Middle East \"has not been this grave for many years,\" and that recognizing a Palestinian state is a way of \"supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security,\" St\u00f8re said.\n\nAid suspension\n\nThe United Nations has suspended food distribution in Rafah on Gaza's southern border due to depleted supplies and insecurity.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday the distribution centers of the World Food Program and UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees, are inaccessible because of the ongoing Israeli military operation in Rafah.\n\nAbout 1.1 million people face high levels of hunger, the U.N. said. The Rafah crossing into Egypt, once the main entrance for aid, has been closed since May 6, and no aid trucks have crossed the U.S.-built floating pier in two days, the U.N. said.\n\nA WFP spokesperson said the \"humanitarian operations in Gaza are near collapse.\" Abeer Etefa warned that if food and other supplies don't resume entering Gaza in \"massive quantities, famine-like conditions will spread.\"\n\nIn addition, UNRWA said its health centers have not received any medical supplies in 10 days, but its health care staff still conducts medical consultations at its centers that remain open.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type":

Israel has slaughtered more than 35,700 Palestinians since then, defying international calls for a ceasefire and ending the brutal war.\n\nNo peace without recognition\n\nNorway was the first to announce its decision.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" the Scandinavian country's prime minister said.\n\nJonas Gahr added, \"By recognizing a Palestinian state, Norway supports the Arab peace plan\". He said his county regards Palestine as an independent state \"with all the rights and obligations that entails\".\n\nHistoric day for Palestine\n\nThe Irish premier described the move as \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine.\"\n\nSimon Harris said it was intended to help move the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to resolution through a two-state solution.\n\nHe added that other countries will recognize a Palestinian state \"in the weeks ahead.\"\n\nSince 1988, 139 of 193 United Nations member states have recognized Palestinian statehood.\n\nS\u00e1nchez blasts Netanyahu\n\nAddressing the parliament in Madrid, the Spanish prime minister said, \"We are going to recognize Palestine for many reasons and we can sum that up in three words - peace, justice and consistency.\"\n\n\"We have to make sure that the two-state solution is respected and there must be mutual guarantees of security,\" Pedro S\u00e1nchez said.\n\nHe also made a blistering attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Israeli massacres of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Prime Minister Netanyahu is still turning a blind eye and bombing hospitals, schools, homes. He is still using hunger, cold and terror to punish more than a million innocent boys and girls - and things have gone so far that prosecutors at the international criminal court have this week sought his arrest for war crimes.\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez was referring to Monday's comments made by ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan.\n\nKhan said his office had applied for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and war minister Yoav Gallant, citing their responsibility in war crimes and crimes against humanity that the Israeli army has committed in the Gaza Strip over the past seven months.\n\nEarlier this month, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution that backed the Palestinian bid for full UN membership.\n\nBut last month, the US vetoed a widely backed Security Council resolution that would have paved the way for full UN membership for Palestine. The US was the only country that blocked the resolution. Britain and Switzerland abstained while 12 other countries voted in favor. The US move threw a spotlight on Washington's growing global isolation over its unwavering support for Israel.\n\nThe United States claims it backs the idea of an independent Palestinian state. It, however, says Palestinian independence should come as part of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nNonetheless, Israel has opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state. Leaked Israeli documents show that Israel has been seeking to forcibly transfer Gaza's population to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula after the Gaza war erupted.\n\nUS-mediated talks between Israel and Palestinians which led to the signing of the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s did not lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nSince then, Israel has used peace talks as a smokescreen to expand its illegal settlements and grab more Palestinian lands.\n\nIt is clear that negotiations only help Israel carry out its ethnic cleansing plans in the Palestinian territories.\n\nPresently, the recognition of Palestine by Spain, Norway and Ireland is rooted in the Palestinian resistance against Israel amid the regime's genocidal war in Gaza and its deadly attacks in the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian resistance indeed has been instrumental in amplifying the voices of those who are fighting against the Israeli oppression and tyranny.\n\nBy sharing their stories and struggles, the Palestinian resistance has inspired widespread solidarity and outrage, galvanizing people across the world to take action against Israel's brutality and oppression, the manifestation of which is seen in global pro-Palestine protests.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

The decision is scheduled to be ratified next Tuesday and would bring the total number of United Nations member states that recognize a Palestinian state to 146 out of 193.\n\nAll three nations also have full diplomatic ties with Israel, which is currently recognized by 165 U.N. member states, the most recent being the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, which established relations as part of the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords that began in late 2020.\n\nThere was no indication that Ireland, Norway and Spain planned to downgrade their relationship with Israel, and most U.N. member states recognize both Israeli and Palestinian statehood.\n\nStill, Israeli officials reacted strongly to the move, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz announcing the withdrawal of the country's ambassadors to Ireland and Norway \"for consultations\" and threatening similar \"severe consequences\" for Spain if it went through with its own decision.\n\n\"Today's decision sends a message to the Palestinians and the world: Terrorism pays,\" Katz said in a statement. \"After the Hamas terror organization carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after committing heinous sexual crimes witnessed by the world, these countries chose to reward Hamas and Iran by recognizing a Palestinian state.\"\n\nThe European trio's step is only the latest diplomatic shift since the war in Gaza began. Reports suggest other nations, including Belgium, Malta and Slovenia, may follow suit.\n\nThe announcements by the Irish, Norwegian and Spanish leaders were praised by the two leading Palestinian governing bodies.\n\n\"We thank you, your government, & your people for your historical friendship, your commitment to justice & freedom, & for solidifying your recognition of Palestinian self-determination & sovereignty,\" the Palestinian Mission to the United Nations wrote in messages addressed to the three nations on X, formerly Twitter. \"Today, hope is renewed & tomorrow inches closer towards peace\"\n\nThe mission is administered by the Palestinian National Authority (PA), led by President Mahmoud Abbas, whose successful bid for U.N. nonmember observer state status was granted in 2015. While the West Bank-based PA is the most widely recognized representative of the Palestinian people, it lost control of Gaza in 2007 amid a violent dispute between the PA's dominant left-wing Fatah faction and the Islamist Hamas movement after the latter prevailed in the last legislative elections to be held by Palestinians.\n\nHamas continues to administer Gaza and has fought several wars with Israel, but the latest conflict is by far the longest and deadliest, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeking to eliminate the group's rule altogether in response to its October surprise attack.\n\n\"We welcome the announcement by Norway, Ireland and Spain of recognizing the State of Palestine, and consider it an important step on the path of affirming our right to our land and independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,\" Hamas said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"We call on countries worldwide to recognize our legitimate national rights and support the struggle of our Palestinian people for liberation, independence, and ending the Zionist occupation to our land.\"\n\nPalestinians have sought to achieve full statehood since the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the colonial Mandate of Palestine in 1948. Unlike the exit from the Indian subcontinent just one year earlier, there was no partition of the territory into two separate states and a coalition of Arab nations quickly went to war with the newly self-proclaimed State of Israel in support of Palestinian territorial claims.\n\nIsrael was nonetheless admitted into the U.N. the following year, but local and regional conflict ensued over Palestinian claims. Israel expanded its control in the 1967 Six-Day War to include east Jerusalem and Syria's Golan Heights, both of which were later annexed by Israel without international recognition, as well as Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, from which Israel withdrew in 1982 following a peace treaty with Cairo.\n\nAmid an ongoing Palestinian insurgency, a number of attempts were made for a broader peace agreement in line with a two-state solution through which both an Israeli and Palestinian state could coexist. The U.N. continued to recognize the pre-1967 Palestinian borders, which include east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, but this framework has been rejected by Israel and Palestinian opposition groups, including Hamas, though the group later signaled an openness to this concept in 2017.\n\nA fragile breakthrough emerged in the 1990s with the Oslo Peace Accords that led to the establishment of the PA and an Israel-Jordan peace treaty. Unrest persisted, however, with the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000 and, while Israel ultimately withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Hamas' subsequent takeover of the territory, growing Israeli direct and indirect control over the West Bank and upticks in Israeli-Palestinian violence, which had already reached record levels prior to the current war, have left little room for renewed peace efforts.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the United States has continued to advocate for a two-state solution but has blocked attempts by the U.N. to push for full Palestinian statehood. The latest vote brought before the U.N. General Assembly earlier this month drew support from the 143 nations, with nine countries, including the U.S. and Israel, opposing and 25 abstentions.\n\nNotably, more than a dozen countries that do not recognize Palestinian statehood, such as Australia, France and Japan, supported the measure, while others that already recognize Palestinian statehood, including Bulgaria, Sweden and Ukraine, opted to abstain, or, in the cases of Argentina, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Papua New Guinea, vote against it.\n\n\"Our vote does not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood; we have been very clear that we support it and seek to advance it meaningfully,\" U.S. Representative Robert Wood said in his explanation of the vote in May. \"Instead, it is an acknowledgement that statehood will come only from a process that involves direct negotiations between the parties.\"\n\nThe U.S. was the sole permanent member to vote against the move in an earlier vote at the 15-member U.N. Security Council last month, using its veto to block the process of Palestinian statehood moving forward at the international level.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration has sought to advance further Israeli normalization with the Arab world by negotiating a deal that would see Saudi Arabia establish diplomatic relations with the U.S. ally. Though talks continue, Riyadh has stated it would not take the step unless a pathway to Palestinian statehood was first secured.\n\nPressure has also mounted against Israel over the humanitarian impact of the war in Gaza and at least nine nations have withdrawn their ambassadors from Israel, reduced relations or cut ties altogether.\n\nAs two more nations, Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas, announced decisions to recognize Palestinian statehood earlier this month, aligning the entirety of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on the issue, Turkey was the most recent to downgrade relations with Israel, announcing a severance of trade ties until a \"permanent ceasefire\" was reached in Gaza.\n\nIn response, Israeli top diplomat Katz accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of behaving like a \"dictator\" in \"disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen, and ignoring international trade agreements.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

Aid agencies have also warned of widespread hunger and shortages of medical supplies and fuel.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Mr. Trudeau should follow the lead of Norway, Spain and Ireland, adding his party would also prioritize a two-state solution to the conflict.\n\n\"We absolutely believe that we need to recognize Palestine as a state to move forward with a two-state solution,\" Mr. Singh told reporters in Parliament. \"Canada should take this position.\"\n\nEarlier this month the federal government shifted its long-standing policy on when it would recognize a Palestinian state, saying it would consider it before the terms of a two-state solution are finalized. Previously, Canada's position had been that it would recognize a Palestinian state only as the last step in such a process.\n\nIt changed its position as Canada abstained from a United Nations vote on a Palestinian bid to become a full UN member. In the past Canada has voted with the United States and Israel against such resolutions.\n\nThe vote passed in the General Assembly with overwhelming support. It was seen by some as a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state, but the United States vetoed it in the UN Security Council last month.\n\nIn an interview with The Globe and Mail, Iddo Moed, Israel's Ambassador to Canada, said \"Canada's position has been made clear.\"\n\nHe said recognizing a Palestinian state now would be a \"direct reward for the atrocities of [the] 7th of October.\" He argued that, with Hamas in power, there is no one for Israel currently to negotiate a two-state solution with.\n\n\"The issue at hand is Hamas,\" he said.\n\n\"We will live together side-by-side with the Palestinians. We'll have to reach a time that we can negotiate that, but we can't do that right now,\" he said.\n\nAround 144 out of 193 member states of the United Nations recognize Palestine as a state, including India, Russia and China. But only a few members of the European Union have done so.\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry said on Wednesday it had ordered an immediate recall of its ambassadors to Ireland and Norway in response to their decisions to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that decision undermined Israel's right to self defence, as well as efforts to return the 128 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nMs. McPherson said the NDP has been arguing since February for Canada to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\n\"It is time for Canada to join the growing number of countries recognizing it. The right of the Palestinian people to statehood is a globally recognized right and it doesn't legally require negotiation or a peace settlement,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims said \"recognizing Palestinian statehood is a significant step towards achieving peace in the region.\"\n\n\"Norway and Ireland's decision reflects a commitment to supporting the rights of the Palestinian people. We will continue to urge the Canadian government to immediately do the same in recognizing Palestinian statehood,\" said spokeswoman Fatema Abdalla.\n\nBut Shimon Koffler Fogel, president and CEO of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said \"the premature recognition of a Palestinian state\" would jeopardize the goal of a peaceful two-state solution and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nHe said it \"sends a message that the type of terrorism Hamas has been continually and regularly engaged in gets handsomely rewarded on the global stage.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com",

Israel denounced the decisions and recalled its ambassadors to the three countries.\n\nPalestinian officials welcomed the announcements as an affirmation of their decades-long quest for statehood in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip -- territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and still controls.\n\nWhile some 140 countries -- more than two-thirds of the United Nations -- recognize a Palestinian state, Wednesday's cascade of announcements could build momentum at a time when even close allies of Israel have piled on criticism for its conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe timing of the move was a surprise, but discussions have been underway for weeks in some European Union countries about possibly recognizing a Palestinian state. Proponents have argued that the war has shown the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nIn addition to recalling the ambassadors to the three countries, Israel summoned their envoys, accusing the Europeans of rewarding the militant Hamas group for its Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the European ambassadors would watch grisly video footage of the attack.\n\nIn that assault, Hamas-led militants stormed across the border, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The ICC prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders. Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and has caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor has accused Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\n\"History will remember that Spain, Norway, and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to Hamas murderers and rapists,\" Katz said.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\n\"We will not even allow a statement about a Palestinian state,\" he said.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, a move that threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA. Smotrich said Wednesday that he was ending that arrangement.\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community has viewed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians, while long advocating for a Palestinian state -- is planned for May 28.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nA Pee Dee police chief's wife was arrested on drug and gun charges.

Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first. \"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel says any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to over 500,000 Israelis. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nNetanyahu has said Israel will maintain security control of Gaza even after any defeat of Hamas, and the war is still raging there. An Israeli airstrike early Wednesday killed 10 people, including four women and four children, who had been displaced and were sheltering in central Gaza, according to hospital authorities.\n\nHugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said \"recognition is a tangible step towards a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination.\"\n\nTo have an impact, he said, it must come with \"tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory - such as banning settlement products and financial services.\"\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide defended the importance of the move in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that while the country has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state for decades, it knew that recognition is \"a card that you can play once.\"\n\n\"We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process,\" he said. \"Now we have realized that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.\"\n\nWilson reported from Barcelona, Spain, and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

This stance follows Ireland, Spain, and Norway's announcement to recognize a Palestinian state. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan reiterated Biden's preference for a two-state solution through direct negotiations to ensure stability in the region.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden believes a Palestinian state should be achieved through negotiations, not unilateral recognition, the White House said on Wednesday after Ireland, Spain and Norway said they would recognize a Palestinian state this month. Washington's reaction appeared to signal U.S. dismay that the three European nations announced an intent to proceed with unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which does not exist in practice.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told a regular news briefing each country could make its own decision on recognition of a Palestinian state, but that Biden thinks direct negotiations by the parties is the best approach. \"President Biden believes that a two-state solution that guarantees Israel's security and also a future of dignity and security for the Palestinian people is the best way to bring about long-term security and stability for everyone in the region,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"President Biden ... has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not for unilateral recognition.\" Sullivan had been asked if the United States was concerned that other nations might follow suit in recognizing a Palestinian state. He said the U.S. would communicate its consistent position to partners \"see what unfolds.\"\n\nWAR IN GAZA Decades of U.S. efforts have failed to achieve a \"two-state solution\" with Israel living alongside a Palestinian state encompassing the West Bank, ruled by the Palestinian Authority (PA), and Gaza, ruled by the Hamas Islamist movement since it seized the coastal strip from the PA in a brief 2007 civil war.\n\nIsrael began an offensive in Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli figures. More than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, health officials in the Hamas-run enclave say.\n\nIsrael is now attacking Rafah in southern Gaza, saying it wants to root out Hamas militants. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Rafah since the start of the assault, and the main access routes for aid into Gaza have been blocked. Sullivan said he was briefed on Israeli plans to minimize civilian harm in Rafah during a weekend visit to the region, and Washington will track whether the assault causes widespread death and destruction or is more precise and proportional.\n\n\"We now have to see what unfolds from here,\" he said. He said aid was flowing in from a pier in Gaza, and that it was wrong for Israel to withhold funds from the West Bank.\n\nThe Biden administration also hopes to broker an arrangement leading Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations. As part of that process, Saudi Arabia has demanded the Gaza conflict end and a path to a Palestinian state, something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be likely to find hard to accept.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_53_54_7540817.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2161, "textEnd": 2167}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Harris called for all the hostages currently being held by Hamas in Gaza to be released.\n\nHarris pointed to Ireland's own history and the importance of getting recognition from other nations.\n\nThe vision for a Palestinian state put forward by Norway is not one led by the Hamas militants who have ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, but one derived from the Palestinian Authority in charge of parts of the West Bank.\n\nNorway's St\u00f8re said the situation in the Middle East \"has not been this grave for many years,\" and that recognizing a Palestinian state is a way of \"supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security,\" St\u00f8re said.\n\nA ship transporting international humanitarian aid is moored at the U.S.-built Trident Pier near Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip on May 21, 2024.\n\nAid suspension\n\nThe United Nations has suspended food distribution in Rafah on Gaza's southern border due to depleted supplies and insecurity.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday the distribution centers of the World Food Program and UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees, are inaccessible because of the ongoing Israeli military operation in Rafah.\n\nAbout 1.1 million people face high levels of hunger, the U.N. said. The Rafah crossing into Egypt, once the main entrance for aid, has been closed since May 6, and no aid trucks have crossed the U.S.-built floating pier in two days, the U.N. said.\n\nA WFP spokesperson said the \"humanitarian operations in Gaza are near collapse.\" Abeer Etefa warned that if food and other supplies don't resume entering Gaza in \"massive quantities, famine-like conditions will spread.\"\n\nIn addition, UNRWA said its health centers have not received any medical supplies in 10 days, but its health care staff still conducts medical consultations at its centers that remain open.\n\nSome information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "irishsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Sun"},

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Rafah since the start of the assault, and the main access routes for aid into Gaza have been blocked.\n\nSullivan said he was briefed on Israeli plans to minimize civilian harm in Rafah during a weekend visit to the region, and Washington will track whether the assault causes widespread death and destruction or is more precise and proportional.\n\n\"We now have to see what unfolds from here,\" he said.\n\nHe said aid was flowing in from a pier in Gaza, and that it was wrong for Israel to withhold funds from the West Bank.\n\nThe Biden administration also hopes to broker an arrangement leading Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize relations. As part of that process, Saudi Arabia has demanded the Gaza conflict end and a path to a Palestinian state, something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be likely to find hard to accept.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/10/world_section_default_image_crop-2023-10-646b43185e7dac20bd43538112f430e4-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1786, "textEnd": 1792}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governs the West Bank.\n\nThey were initially connected by land under the United Nation's partition plan in 1947, but Israel has absorbed much of that land in successive wars since then.\n\nAlthough nominally governed by Palestinians, much of what is formally part of the West Bank is under Israeli control, with military checkpoints and segregated roads.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority controls just 17% of the West Bank, although this accounts for most of the area's Palestinian population.\n\nIsraeli settlements, deemed illegal under international law, have been set up in the West Bank, gradually encroaching on Palestinian territory and carving gaps between Palestinian cities, towns and villages.\n\nSettlers have been responsible for the theft and destruction of Palestinian homes, and acts of violence against Palestinian civilians.\n\nOnce opposed by Israel's governments, they've received backing and military protection from the current administration of Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThis has made them a key point of contention in negotiations between Israel and Palestine, not least because their existence makes an independent Palestinian entity unlikely if not impossible.\n\nAny peace agreement would likely require a removal of the 500,000 Israeli settlers from the West Bank, similar to Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.\n\nIt may also include other transfers of people and land between the two sides.\n\nOf course, however, there are people in Palestine who hope for a Palestinian state across all of the land currently consisting of Israel and Palestine, much like there are Israelis who hope for the same for themselves.\n\nIrish, Spanish and Norwegian leaders have justified their recognition of Palestine as a step towards peace by placing it on an equal footing with Israel in future peace negotiations.\n\nDeane called it an attempt 'to stem the relentless carnage in Gaza and to curb the escalating destruction in the occupied West Bank'.\n\nIt comes after more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's invasion of Gaza, launched in response to Hamas' massacre of 1,200 people and kidnapping of 200 hostages on October 7.\n\nDeane said: 'Recognising Palestine in these circumstances directs our attention to the catastrophic military action of the incumbent Israeli government and to the perilous state of Palestine and Palestinians so that we might collectively seek to preserve a space for a two-state solution.'\n\nThe three European countries have been discussing these plans for several months, but they have long been critical of Israel's behaviour in Palestine.\n\nIreland in particular is a long-time supporter of Palestinian statehood, which has brought it into diplomatic conflicts with Israel in the past.\n\nAn Irish vessel - MV Saoirse - was raided by Israeli forces in 2011 when it was part of an aid flotilla attempting to break Israel's sea blockade of Gaza.\n\nThis reflects an understanding of the Israel-Palestine conflict framed through the lens of Ireland's own experience of gaining independence from the UK after centuries of conflict and colonisation.\n\nHarris said: 'From our own history we know what it means, recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value.'\n\nAlthough Israel's government has described this latest move to recognise Palestine as a reward for Hamas' brutality on October, Irish politicans see it as the opposite.\n\nMore than 3,700 people were killed, mainly by sectarian paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, during the three-decade conflict known as the Troubles.\n\nNearly half of Northern Irish adults know someone killed or injured in the military clashes and acts of terrorism of that era.\n\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan, part of Ireland's coalition government, said they 'learnt the hard way, that violence against innocent civilians to try and achieve political aims, can, and must never win'.\n\nHe said: 'Whether that be a car bomb on the streets of Omagh or Jerusalem, be that a rocket landing in Tel Aviv, or a no warning blast in a Birmingham pub, be that an assault on the Kibbutz, or a bomb dropped from a jet fighter onto a refugee camp or a Gaza hospital, it is all wrong.'\n\nBut Emmanuel Navon, an international relations expert at the European Leadership Network (ELNET), is skeptical of their reasons for recognition.\n\nHe put Ireland's actions down to 'a long history of having anti-Israel positions'.\n\nNavon also questioned how genuine Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez's support for Palestinian statehood is.\n\nHe told Metro.co.uk: 'He told Metro.co.uk: 'He has a minority government, which he established with the radical left and the [separatists].\n\n'This is basically to cater to his domestic support.'\n\n'This kind of thing has a cumulative impact', said Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israeli politics and international relations.\n\nHe told Metro.co.uk: 'It's part of a bigger movement which, it's a paradox for some, was accelerated by the war in Gaza. Israel spins it as a reward to Hamas.\n\n'This is not the case. It's just changing the dynamic of the relations between Israel and Palestine when it comes to a peace process, whenever it takes place.\n\n'It's thinking about a so-called \"day after\".'\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, formed in the 1990s, already operates in many ways like a state.\n\nIt has 80 embassies around the world. It is represented at the UN as a non-member observer state.\n\nThe governing body also provides education, healthcare, rubbish collection and law enforcement in the 17% of the West Bank it controls.\n\nHowever, it has not held an election since 2006 when Hamas won a majority, sparking a conflict with Fatah that resulted in a split between Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nIreland, Spain and Norway hope their recognition of Palestine as a state will pave the way for genuine independence under Palestinian control.\n\n'Legally it won't make a difference', according to Navon.\n\n'But I think the consequences will be in terms of perception. The message it sends to the Palestinian is basically that terrorism pays.\n\n'You don't have recognition for the past 20 years, but you do October 7 and you get recognition.\n\n'It de-incentivises them to negotiate and compromise with Israel because the message is that you don't have to negotiate or compromise, just commit an atrocity.'\n\nPalestinian statehood has been offered in peace agreements proposed in the last few decades.\n\nBut Israeli and Palestinian leaders have failed to reach a compromise satisfactory for both sides.\n\nNavon said: 'As long as the Palestinian leadership rejects that solution, I don't know how we're going to reach it.'\n\nNow the Israeli government opposes an independent Palestine.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu advocates an autonomous Palestine with no military capability, and its security controlled by Israel, something unacceptable to most Palestinians.\n\nThis has been Israel's position for 30 years, but the country has grown more wary of the prospect of a Palestinian state since October 7.\n\nFor Israelis, the bloodshed of that day confirmed their worst fears regarding Palestinians' intentions.\n\nNavon said: 'As long as the Palestinian leadership, whether it is Hamas or Fatah, continues to hope for the destruction of Israel, there won't be peace.\n\n'The moment they give up on that dream, on that nightmare, we might be able to compromise.\n\n'But so far, they've used negotiations, and Israeli withdrawal to establish military equipments and bases to attack Israel.'\n\nHowever, a peace agreement would also require significant concessions from Israel, not least abandoning any desire to see a Jewish state occupying all of historic Palestine.\n\nThis is a vision advocated by members of Netanyahu's government, and by many of the Israeli settlers in the West Bank, who may face removal in such an agreement.\n\nA key question now is whether Israel is willing to do that again.\n\nNavon said: 'We know what was the outcome of this removal [from Gaza in 2005], of Hamas taking over power, establishing a huge terrorist army there and attacking Israel.'\n\nThe latest move to recognise Palestine as a state has also increased Israel's sense that it is 'under attack from the international community', according to Mekelberg.\n\nIt comes amid increasing criticism of the conduct of its war in Gaza, South Africa's war crimes case against Israel at the International Criminal Court (ICC), and a move by ICC to seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leaders.\n\nNavon said: 'These governments in Europe do not seem to understand that Israel after October 7 is a different country, Israelis are a different people.'\n\nHe added: 'Most Israelis reacted to October 7, and the statements and declarations with - pardon my French - 'Screw them, we'll just fight Hamas, we'll just finish the job.'\n\nThe vast majority of the 193 United Nations member states recognise Palestine as a sovereign state.\n\nOnce Ireland, Spain and Norway have formally recognised it on May 28, that number will be 146.\n\nThey'll be bucking the trend among countries in Europe, where most countries have not granted diplomatic recognition despite generally voicing support for a two-state solution.\n\nSlovenia has also......\n\nVatican City and the partially recognised Sahrawi Republic, or Western Sahara, also recognise a Palestinian state, but it is not a member of the UN.\n\nHere is the full list of the 148 countries that recognise Palestine, including the three countries about to:\n\nMost of the countries that do not recognise Palestine are in Europe.\n\nOf the 44 countries in the continent, 24 don't recognise it, accounting for nearly half the 50 states around the world in this category.\n\nThe full list of countries that don't recognise Palestine, excluding the three countries about to, is:\n\nMORE : Amal Clooney reveals secret work to prosecute Gaza war crimes after TikTok criticism for her 'silence'", "source":

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA.

Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

This recognition is not against anyone, it is in favour of peace and coexistence.\" (BBC)\n\nIn response, Israel immediately called on its ambassadors in the nations to return.\n\n\"I'm sending a clear and unequivocal message to Ireland and Norway: Israel will not remain silent in the face of those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said. \"Today's decision sends a message to the Palestinians and the world: Terrorism pays. After the Hamas terror organization carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after committing heinous sexual crimes witnessed by the world, these countries chose to reward Hamas and Iran by recognizing a Palestinian state. This distorted step by these countries is an injustice to the memory of the victims of [10/7], a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages, and a boost to Hamas and Iran's jihadists, which undermines the chance for peace and questions Israel's right to self-defense. Israel will not remain silent - there will be further severe consequences.\"\n\nHe also said the ambassadors from the three countries in Israel will be given \"reprimand talks\" and shown footage from the Oct. 7 attack, according to BBC.\n\nHamas and the Palestinian Authority celebrated the move by Norway, Spain, and Ireland, which was denounced by those on the left and right in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leah_barkoukis@townhall.com", "name": "Leah Barkoukis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Gahr_St\u00f8re", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miche\u00e1l_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miche\u00e1l Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/332/a93dbaae-a135-4686-8429-24f5e544e680.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 136}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2631, "textEnd": 2637}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Lincoln's Bryan Olesen awaits fate on 'The Voice'\n\nProponents argue the war showed the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community views the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community views the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Plans may need to be altered. Former McDowell man serving life sentence for murder killed in prison\n\nProponents argue the war showed the need for a new push toward a two-state solution, 15 years after negotiations collapsed between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community views the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

He said in a statement that he had informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would no longer send tax revenues to the authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank in close cooperation with Israel.\n\nSmotrich's office signaled that the decision was at least partly a response to Spain, Norway and Ireland recognizing Palestinian statehood, and that the Palestinian leadership bore responsibility for campaigning for the move.\n\n\"They are acting against Israel legally, diplomatically and for unilateral recognition,\" said Eytan Fuld, a spokesperson for Smotrich, referring to the authority. \"When they act against the state of Israel, there must be a response.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Authority did not immediately respond, but Palestinian officials have previously condemned Israel's withholding of Palestinian tax revenues it collects as \"piracy.\"\n\nIsrael also recalled its ambassadors from Spain, Ireland and Norway for consultations Wednesday morning. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had summoned the countries' envoys to Israel for a \"severe scolding\" following \"their governments' decision to award a gold medal to Hamas terrorists.\"\n\nNetanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment on Smotrich's statement, nor did it immediately comment on the European countries' announcements.\n\nUnder decades-old agreements, Israel collects customs and import taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Those revenues constitute most of the Palestinian budget, particularly as international aid has declined. But Smotrich -- who has labeled the Palestinian Authority \"an enemy\" -- had already delayed transferring the latest tranche of funds before the announcements Wednesday, said Fuld and a Palestinian official. The Palestinian official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority is already in a severe financial crisis following tightened Israeli restrictions on its funding and a depressed West Bank economy stemming from the war. This month, it managed to pay only 50% of the salaries of tens of thousands of civil servants.\n\nDiplomats and analysts have warned that the Palestinian government's deepening financial problems could lead to further unrest in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, many in clashes with Israeli forces, since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 prompted Israel to go to war in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Authority Health Ministry.\n\nPalestinians have faced tightening Israeli restrictions since Oct. 7. Over 100,000 Palestinians who worked in Israel were barred from entering, creating mass unemployment overnight. Near-nightly raids, Israeli road closures, and stricter checkpoints have further choked the Palestinian economy.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority traditionally disburses some of the tax funds collected by Israel to Gaza. After the war broke out in October, Smotrich said he would withhold that part from the amount it transfers to the authority. Palestinian officials refused to accept the reduced payments at all in protest.\n\nAfter a monthslong standoff over the issue, Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to a deal stipulating that Norway would hold some of the revenues in trust until Israel agreed they could be sent to the Palestinians. The Palestinians agreed to receive the reduced payments in the meantime.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smotrich called for the government to immediately annul that agreement as well.\n\nTop Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, have repeatedly excoriated international recognition of a Palestinian state as a \"prize for terrorism\" after the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nMost of the current hard-line Israeli government rejects the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, practically ruling out peace talks to end Israel's decadeslong occupation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have said that after the war, Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under a \"revitalized\" Palestinian Authority. Israel has remained vehemently opposed to that idea. The authority in its current form is also unpopular among Palestinians, who view it as complicit in Israel's occupation.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Rafah since the start of the assault, and the main access routes for aid into Gaza have been blocked.\n\nSullivan said he was briefed on Israeli plans to minimize civilian harm in Rafah during a weekend visit to the region, and Washington will track whether the assault causes widespread death and destruction or is more precise and proportional.\n\n\"We now have to see what unfolds from here,\" he said.\n\nHe said aid was flowing in from a pier in Gaza, and that it was wrong for Israel to withhold funds from the West Bank.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4376911-1234529430.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1789, "textEnd": 1795}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community views the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

Everything he's said", "body": "President Joe Biden has been calling for a two-state solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians but has fallen short of recognizing a Palestinian state, and it remains to be seen if he will join a growing number of other countries who are doing so.\n\nOn Wednesday, Norway, Ireland, and Spain committed to recognizing a Palestinian state next Tuesday. This is a significant show of support for the Palestinians whose homes in Gaza have been bombed by Israel during its war with Hamas. Currently, 142 of the 193 countries in the United Nations already recognize a Palestinian state, according to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The U.S. is not included in this list.\n\nLast October, Hamas led the deadliest Palestinian militant attack on Israel in history, which led Israel to retaliate. Some 1,200 people were killed by the Hamas force and roughly 250 hostages were taken. Roughly 100 hostages are still in captivity. More than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nThe U.S. has remained loyal to its ally Israel during the war, but the Biden administration has continued to call for a two-state solution in hopes that it would bring peace to the region. In the two-state solution, the Palestinians, who currently occupy the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, would get a recognized state alongside Israel. This solution would also theoretically benefit Israel as it would lead to a more secure state.\n\nWhen asked if Biden would recognize a Palestinian state at this point, a National Security Council (NSC) spokesperson told Newsweek via email on Wednesday, \"The President is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career. He believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\"\n\nIn a White House address from October, Biden said, \"As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution,\" adding, \"Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace.\"\n\nOn Sunday, during a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, Biden said he has been continuing his work on a two-state solution as well as a temporary ceasefire to get the remaining hostages in Gaza out and more humanitarian aid in.\n\nBiden called the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"That's why I've called for an immediate ceasefire ... I've been working on a deal as we speak. We're going around the clock ... I'm working to make sure we finally get a two-state solution,\" he said.\n\nThe two-state solution has been a goal for lasting peace in the Middle East among the international community decades before the Israel-Hamas war. However, it's unclear when, and if, this goal will ever come into fruition.\n\nWhile the Israeli-Palestinian conflict reached a boiling point during Hamas' October attack, tensions have been simmering for years.\n\nDuring an outbreak of violence between the two groups in May 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the Biden administration's commitment to a two-state solution while appearing on ABCs This Week.\n\n\"Look, ultimately, it is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state and, of course, the only way to give the Palestinians the state to which they're entitled,\" he said. \"That's where we have to go.\n\n\"But that, I don't think, is something necessarily for today,\" Blinken said. \"We have to start putting in place the conditions that would allow both sides to engage in a meaningful and positive way toward two states.\"\n\nIs a Two-State Solution Possible?\n\nWhen asked if a two-state solution is even possible, Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C., an international security think tank, told Newsweek via text message on Wednesday, \"It is very hard to see how this happens absent [without] a radical shift in Israel that goes beyond getting rid of the current government.\n\n\"Israel has never recognized a Palestinian state -- not even under the Oslo accords -- and over the past decades has increasingly eaten up the West Bank with settlements.\n\n\"Now Israel is once again occupying Gaza, which is in ruins after 8 months of heavy bombardment. That said, Zionism was a movement for nearly 100 years before Israel achieved independence. If no Palestinian state is established, Israel will either lose its Jewish identity or its democracy. Right now, the latter looks more likely unfortunately.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained his resistance to a two-state solution, despite pressure from Biden to create a plan for lasting peace in the region.\n\nNetanyahu said in a statement in Hebrew in January, \"My insistence is what has prevented -- over the years -- the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,\" adding \"As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP)The decision by three European countries - Ireland, Norway and Spain - to recognise a Palestinian state fits into a long-term goal of Palestinian officials to secure diplomatic acceptance, but it appears that the immediate practical impact will be limited.\n\nBroadly speaking, recognising a state means declaring that it meets the conditions of statehood under international law.It typically opens a path to setting up diplomatic relations and an embassy there.\n\nBut the European countries appeared to be mostly concerned with expressing support for Palestinians and sending a message to Israel.\n\nThe foreign minister of Norway said the country's representative office to the Palestinian Authority, which was opened in the West Bank in 1999, would become an embassy. He gave no date for this change but said it would enable Norway to enter into bilateral agreements.\n\nRecognition would also have some \"domestic legal effects in Norway in areas where issues related to the state of Palestine arise,\" he said.\n\nIreland and Spain focused on the need for peace in Gaza and the importance of a two-state solution, but did not mention embassies or other immediate changes. \"Recognition of Palestine isn't the end of a process, it is the beginning,\" said Irish PM Simon Harris.\n\nUS: Palestinian state should come via talks\n\nUS Prez Joe Biden believes a Palestinian state should be achieved through negotiations, not unilateral recognition, the White House said on Wednesday after Ireland, Spain and Norway said they would recognize a Palestinian state this month. \"The president is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career,\" aspokesman for the White House National Security Council said. \"He believes a

There will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution. And there can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state. In other words, a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East,\" Store said.\n\nHe further explained that the territorial demarcation between Palestine and Israel should be based on the pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem serving as the capital for both states. This stance is without prejudice to a final settlement on borders, which may include land swaps.\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide highlighted the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. \"What is most urgent at the moment is to achieve a ceasefire, ensure that enough humanitarian aid reaches the people of Gaza, and obtain the release of the hostages,\" he said.\n\nOn the same day, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed that their countries would join Norway in recognizing the State of Palestine.\n\n\"Today Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the State of Palestine, each of us will undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision,\" Harris said in Dublin, the Irish capital.\n\nThe Irish prime minister said that \"permanent peace can only be secured upon the basis of the free will of a free people.\"\n\n\"Palestinians in Gaza are enduring the most appalling, suffering, hardship and starvation,\" he said. \"A humanitarian catastrophe, unimaginable to most, and unconscionable to all -- is unfolding in real time.\"\n\nSpain's recognition will also take effect on May 28, following a Council of Ministers session. Sanchez stressed that Spain recognizes Palestine \"for peace, for justice, and for consistency,\" urging both parties to engage in dialogue to achieve a two-state solution. He highlighted the necessity of ending reported abuses in the occupied territories.\n\nThe Palestinian presidency on Wednesday welcomed the recognition. In a statement published by the official news agency WAFA, the Palestinian leadership stated that it highly appreciated the contribution of Norway, Ireland and Spain towards \"consecrating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination on their land and in taking actual steps to support the implementation of the two-state solution.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he has instructed the immediate recall of Israel's ambassadors to Ireland and Norway for consultations in light of the countries' decisions to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\n\"I'm sending a clear and unequivocal message to Ireland and Norway: Israel will not remain silent in the face of those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security,\" Katz said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nEuropean reactions to the recognition varied. Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia expressed support, with Slovenia also initiating steps towards recognizing Palestine.\n\nThe Slovenian government launched on May 9 procedures for Slovenia's recognition of Palestine. Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon expressed hope that the procedures would be completed as soon as possible, as Slovenia wants to help ensure an end to the horrors in Gaza.\n\nA spokesperson from Malta's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Xinhua that Malta had recently affirmed its readiness to recognize Palestine but will wait until such recognition can make a positive contribution, when the circumstances are right.\n\nSlovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said his country supported the resolution on strengthening the rights of the State of Palestine. \"It is the only way to achieve sustainable peace in the region and confirm the historic right of Palestine to self-determination as well as a place in the UN,\" he said in a statement.\n\nConversely, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Lithuania expressed reservations.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said that it makes no sense to recognize Palestine as a state if it is not clear who represents it and on what territory.\n\nThe Dutch government commented it does not recognize the State of Palestine and is not expected to change its position in the near future.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda warned that recognizing Palestinian statehood could escalate the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn Belgium, top ministers also met to consider the situation in Gaza, but no agreement on a possible recognition was reached.\n\nIndependent EU commentator and analyst Shada Islam said that recognition of a Palestinian state by Spain, Ireland and Norway is almost certainly going to be followed by Malta and Slovenia in the coming weeks. France has also said that such recognition is \"not taboo.\"\n\n\"The move by Spain, Ireland and Norway will further isolate Israel in the UN... Their decision sends a strong message to Palestinian people that at least some EU member states have retained their moral compass,\" he told Xinhua.", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com", "dataType":

Now cracks are appearing in that consensus.\n\nIreland, Spain and Norway on Wednesday declared their intention to recognize Palestinian statehood, effective next Tuesday. Previously, only seven of the 27 European Union member states had made such a pronouncement.\n\nNorway is not a member of the bloc, but the Spanish and Irish announcements will bring the number of EU countries recognizing Palestinian statehood to one-third of its membership.\n\nWhile the often-fractious bloc is unlikely to act as a whole on the question, EU members Slovenia and Malta have signaled they may extend recognition as well, and concerted lobbying efforts are under way in several other member states, including Belgium.\n\n\"There's a certain momentum there,\" said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\n\nEven as major Western powers refrain from recognition, the round of announcements illustrates yet again how the devastating war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas is complicating traditional Western alliances -- both within the EU and in transatlantic ties.\n\nFor the last two years, Washington and the EU have been largely focused on presenting a united front on the war in Ukraine, and on the growing closeness of Russia and China. But Gaza has shaken up diplomatic priorities.\n\nAnalysts say Wednesday's announcements primarily point to fundamental disagreements among Western allies over whether recognizing a Palestinian state now -- usually a prelude to establishing diplomatic ties -- will spur or hinder a future state's actual establishment.\n\nThe Biden administration supports the creation of a Palestinian state, existing side-by-side with Israel, but says recognition should be the result of political negotiations -- a view backed by key European partners including Britain, France and Germany.\n\nBut the issue is a nuanced one. Britain's foreign secretary, David Cameron, ruled out recognizing a Palestinian state while Hamas remains in Gaza, but said it could occur in the context of ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nAnd Germany, shadowed by having perpetrated the Holocaust, supports a two-state solution, but has been unwilling to extend Palestinian statehood recognition in the meantime.\n\nThe war's horrific toll in Gaza, where more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, has galvanized some governments to support any moves they believe might set conditions for a cease-fire.\n\n\"Recognition is a tangible step toward a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination,\" said Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut he said without further measures, the recognitions risked being essentially symbolic.\n\n\"To be impactful, recognition of Palestine must be matched with tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory -- such as banning settlement products and financial services,\" he said.\n\nThe differing takes on recognition point to the ways in which European states' own histories can lead them along distinct foreign-policy paths when it comes to the Mideast.\n\n\"Each country's story is different -- it's very idiosyncratic,\" said Elgindy, who directs the Middle East Institute's program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli affairs.\n\nIreland's prime minister, for example, specifically cited his country's lengthy and traumatic struggle for independence from Britain, and the shadow of the decades-long spasm of sectarian violence known as the Troubles, which subsided with the Good Friday peace accords in 1998.\n\n\"From our history we know what it means,\" Simon Harris, the taoiseach, or prime minister, told reporters in Dublin. \"A two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment, where so many wrongs can never make a right.\"\n\nIn making their announcements, all three governments -- Ireland, Spain and Norway -- were at pains to express support for Israel's existence, and revulsion over the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people and triggered the war in Gaza. Still, the recognition amounted to an unmistakable voicing of dismay over the war's immense civilian toll.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone -- it is not against the Israeli people,\" said Spain's prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. He called it \"an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nIsrael, though, was infuriated by the second international episode this week to deepen its wartime isolation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the recognitions a \"reward for terrorism.\"\n\nThe announcements came on the heels of Monday's news that the International Criminal Court's lead prosecutor was seeking arrest warrants for five senior Israeli and Hamas officials, including Netanyahu, over potential war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the current conflict.\n\nMost western European states accept the court's jurisdiction, although the United States and Israel do not.\n\nThe recognition announcements were welcomed both by Hamas and by its rival, the Palestinian Authority. Israel, however, recalled for consultations its ambassadors to Ireland, Spain and Norway over the move.\n\nPalestinian statehood recognition has already been extended by at least 140 of around 190 countries represented in the United Nations, but Wednesday's push represents an impetus not seen for years within Europe.\n\nFive of the earlier EU announcements of recognition date back to 1988, together with that of Cyprus, which extended recognition before joining the bloc. Sweden recognized a Palestinian state in 2014.\n\nNo substantive negotiations toward Palestinian statehood have taken place since 2009. Both Norway and Spain were venues for peace initiatives of a generation ago -- the Oslo accords of the 1990s, and the Madrid Conference of 1991.\n\nWith the war in Gaza now in its eighth month, the U.N. General Assembly this month approved Palestinian \"rights and privileges\" that were seen as a prelude to a potential vote to grant full voting membership. Currently, the Palestinian Authority has observer status.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution. And there can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state. In other words, a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East,\" Store said.\n\nHe further explained that the territorial demarcation between Palestine and Israel should be based on the pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem serving as the capital for both states. This stance is without prejudice to a final settlement on borders, which may include land swaps.\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide highlighted the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. \"What is most urgent at the moment is to achieve a ceasefire, ensure that enough humanitarian aid reaches the people of Gaza, and obtain the release of the hostages,\" he said.\n\nOn the same day, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed that their countries would join Norway in recognizing the State of Palestine.\n\n\"Today Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the State of Palestine, each of us will undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision,\" Harris said in Dublin, the Irish capital.\n\nThe Irish prime minister said that \"permanent peace can only be secured upon the basis of the free will of a free people.\"\n\n\"Palestinians in Gaza are enduring the most appalling, suffering, hardship and starvation,\" he said. \"A humanitarian catastrophe, unimaginable to most, and unconscionable to all -- is unfolding in real time.\"\n\nSpain's recognition will also take effect on May 28, following a Council of Ministers session. Sanchez stressed that Spain recognizes Palestine \"for peace, for justice, and for consistency,\" urging both parties to engage in dialogue to achieve a two-state solution. He highlighted the necessity of ending reported abuses in the occupied territories.\n\nThe Palestinian presidency on Wednesday welcomed the recognition. In a statement published by the official news agency WAFA, the Palestinian leadership stated that it highly appreciated the contribution of Norway, Ireland and Spain towards \"consecrating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination on their land and in taking actual steps to support the implementation of the two-state solution.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he has instructed the immediate recall of Israel's ambassadors to Ireland and Norway for consultations in light of the countries' decisions to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\n\"I'm sending a clear and unequivocal message to Ireland and Norway: Israel will not remain silent in the face of those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security,\" Katz said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nEuropean reactions to the recognition varied. Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia expressed support, with Slovenia also initiating steps towards recognizing Palestine.\n\nThe Slovenian government launched on May 9 procedures for Slovenia's recognition of Palestine. Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon expressed hope that the procedures would be completed as soon as possible, as Slovenia wants to help ensure an end to the horrors in Gaza.\n\nA spokesperson from Malta's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Xinhua that Malta had recently affirmed its readiness to recognize Palestine but will wait until such recognition can make a positive contribution, when the circumstances are right.\n\nSlovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said his country supported the resolution on strengthening the rights of the State of Palestine. \"It is the only way to achieve sustainable peace in the region and confirm the historic right of Palestine to self-determination as well as a place in the UN,\" he said in a statement.\n\nConversely, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Lithuania expressed reservations.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said that it makes no sense to recognize Palestine as a state if it is not clear who represents it and on what territory.\n\nThe Dutch government commented it does not recognize the State of Palestine and is not expected to change its position in the near future.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda warned that recognizing Palestinian statehood could escalate the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn Belgium, top ministers also met to consider the situation in Gaza, but no agreement on a possible recognition was reached.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said such recognition is not a taboo while stressing the timing, saying conditions had not yet been met. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also made a similar statement.\n\nIndependent EU commentator and analyst Shada Islam said that the recognition of a Palestinian state by Norway, Ireland and Spain is almost certainly going to be followed by Malta and Slovenia in the coming weeks.\n\n\"The move by Spain, Ireland and Norway will further isolate Israel in the UN... Their decision sends a strong message to Palestinian people that at least some EU member states have retained their moral compass,\" she told Xinhua. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn",

This move has prompted swift reactions from Israel, which has recalled its ambassadors to these three European countries\u2074\u2075\u2076.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister **Benjamin Netanyahu** characterized the recognition as a \"reward for terror,\" particularly in light of the **October 7 attack** launched by Palestinian militant group **Hamas**, which sparked the ongoing Gaza war\u2074. In response, Israel is recalling its envoys to Dublin, Oslo, and Madrid for \"urgent consultations\" and has also summoned the three European ambassadors for a rebuke\u2074.\n\nThe European Union's foreign affairs chief, **Josep Borrell**, expressed his intention to work with the bloc's 27 members \"to promote a common EU position based on a two-state solution\"\u2074. Meanwhile, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, **Itamar Ben Gvir**, criticized the recognition, stating that it rewarded \"murderers and aggressors\"\u2074.\n\nThe White House clarified that President **Joe Biden** opposes unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and believes it should be realized \"through direct negotiations\"\u2074. Biden's National Security Advisor, **Jake Sullivan**, warned Israel not to withhold funding intended for the Palestinian Authority in retaliation\u2074.\n\nWhile most Western governments express willingness to recognize Palestinian statehood eventually, they emphasize that thorny issues such as final borders and the status of Jerusalem need resolution before formal recognition occurs\u2074.\n\nNorwegian Prime Minister **Jonas Gahr Store** highlighted that \"recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict\"\u2074. Spain's Prime Minister **Pedro Sanchez** criticized Netanyahu's actions, asserting that they endanger the two-state solution\u2074. Irish Prime Minister **Simon Harris** condemned the October 7 attack but emphasized that \"a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation, and resentment\"\u2074.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, welcomed these moves as \"historical,\" while Hamas viewed them as an important step toward affirming their right to their land\u2074. A Palestinian resident in Gaza expressed hope that this decision would help stop Israel from committing further \"heinous crimes\"\u2074.\n\nIn summary, while these recognitions are largely symbolic, they contribute to ongoing discussions about peace and stability in the region.

It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people which is in Israel's interest and it's wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people.

towards \"peace\" in the region.\n\nThe Israeli embassy in Ireland, too, condemned the decision of Spain, Norway and Israel to recognise Palestinian statehood.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the Irish government's decision on recognition, which follows worrying initiatives and statements in recent months,\" Israel's Embassy in Dublin said in a statement on Wednesday, according to a CNN report.\n\nThe Israeli embassy said the decision \"brings more questions than answers\", alleging that recognising Palestinian statehood after the October 7 attacks conducted by Hamas \"sends a

Now cracks are appearing in that consensus.\n\nIreland, Spain and Norway on Wednesday declared their intention to recognize Palestinian statehood, effective next Tuesday. Previously, only seven of the 27 European Union member states had made such a pronouncement.\n\nNorway is not a member of the bloc, but the Spanish and Irish announcements will bring the number of EU countries recognizing Palestinian statehood to one-third of its membership.\n\nWhile the often-fractious bloc is unlikely to act as a whole on the question, EU members Slovenia and Malta have signaled they may extend recognition as well, and concerted lobbying efforts are under way in several other member states, including Belgium.\n\n\"There's a certain momentum there,\" said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\n\nEven as major Western powers refrain from recognition, the round of announcements illustrates yet again how the devastating war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas is complicating traditional Western alliances -- both within the EU and in transatlantic ties.\n\nFor the last two years, Washington and the EU have been largely focused on presenting a united front on the war in Ukraine, and on the growing closeness of Russia and China. But Gaza has shaken up diplomatic priorities.\n\nAnalysts say Wednesday's announcements primarily point to fundamental disagreements among Western allies over whether recognizing a Palestinian state now -- usually a prelude to establishing diplomatic ties -- will spur or hinder a future state's actual establishment.\n\nThe Biden administration supports the creation of a Palestinian state, existing side-by-side with Israel, but says recognition should be the result of political negotiations -- a view backed by key European partners including Britain, France and Germany.\n\nBut the issue is a nuanced one. Britain's foreign secretary, David Cameron, ruled out recognizing a Palestinian state while Hamas remains in Gaza, but said it could occur in the context of ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nAnd Germany, shadowed by having perpetrated the Holocaust, supports a two-state solution, but has been unwilling to extend Palestinian statehood recognition in the meantime.\n\nThe war's horrific toll in Gaza, where more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, has galvanized some governments to support any moves they believe might set conditions for a cease-fire.\n\nRead more: This 5-year-old from Gaza is learning to live with one leg and untold loss\n\n\"Recognition is a tangible step toward a viable political track leading to Palestinian self-determination,\" said Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut he said without further measures, the recognitions risked being essentially symbolic.\n\n\"To be impactful, recognition of Palestine must be matched with tangible steps to counter Israel's annexation and settlement of Palestinian territory -- such as banning settlement products and financial services,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Israel's religious right has a clear plan for Gaza: 'We are occupying, deporting and settling'\n\nThe differing takes on recognition point to the ways in which European states' own histories can lead them along distinct foreign-policy paths when it comes to the Mideast.\n\n\"Each country's story is different -- it's very idiosyncratic,\" said Elgindy, who directs the Middle East Institute's program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli affairs.\n\nIreland's prime minister, for example, specifically cited his country's lengthy and traumatic struggle for independence from Britain, and the shadow of the decades-long spasm of sectarian violence known as the Troubles, which subsided with the Good Friday peace accords in 1998.\n\nRead more: Fathers shot, daughters killed in bombings: Ghosts of the blood-soaked Troubles haunt Northern Ireland\n\n\"From our history we know what it means,\" Simon Harris, the taoiseach, or prime minister, told reporters in Dublin. \"A two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment, where so many wrongs can never make a right.\"\n\nIn making their announcements, all three governments -- Ireland, Spain and Norway -- were at pains to express support for Israel's existence, and revulsion over the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people and triggered the war in Gaza. Still, the recognition amounted to an unmistakable voicing of dismay over the war's immense civilian toll.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone -- it is not against the Israeli people,\" said Spain's prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. He called it \"an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nRead more: Behind a prosecutor's push to arrest Israeli and Hamas leaders\n\nIsrael, though, was infuriated by the second international episode this week to deepen its wartime isolation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the recognitions a \"reward for terrorism.\"\n\nThe announcements came on the heels of Monday's news that the International Criminal Court's lead prosecutor was seeking arrest warrants for five senior Israeli and Hamas officials, including Netanyahu, over potential war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the current conflict.\n\nMost western European states accept the court's jurisdiction, although the United States and Israel do not.\n\nThe recognition announcements were welcomed both by Hamas and by its rival, the Palestinian Authority. Israel, however, recalled for consultations its ambassadors to Ireland, Spain and Norway over the move.\n\nPalestinian statehood recognition has already been extended by at least 140 of around 190 countries represented in the United Nations, but Wednesday's push represents an impetus not seen for years within Europe.\n\nFive of the earlier EU announcements of recognition date back to 1988, together with that of Cyprus, which extended recognition before joining the bloc. Sweden recognized a Palestinian state in 2014.\n\nNo substantive negotiations toward Palestinian statehood have taken place since 2009. Both Norway and Spain were venues for peace initiatives of a generation ago -- the Oslo accords of the 1990s, and the Madrid Conference of 1991.\n\nWith the war in Gaza now in its eighth month, the U.N. General Assembly this month approved Palestinian \"rights and privileges\" that were seen as a prelude to a potential vote to grant full voting membership.

We will communicate that to our partners around the world and we'll see what unfolds,\" he added.\n\nSullivan called Israel's decision to withhold funds from Palestinian authority 'wrong', noting that withholding funds destabilises the West Bank and undermines the search for security and prosperity for the people of Palestine.\n\nOn the US' reaction to Israel's response to recognising Palestinian statehood by withholding funds from Palestinian authority, he said, \"I think it's wrong on a strategic basis because withholding funds destabilizes the West Bank. It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people which is in Israel's interest and it's wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people. So, from our perspective those funds should continue to go um with all of the necessary safeguards but they should continue to flow.\"\n\nAs Spain, Norway, and Ireland announced plans to formally recognise a Palestinian state, Israel reacted to the decision of the three nations in anger and immediately recalled their ambassadors from each country, CNN reported.\n\nIrish foreign minister Micheal Martin said the recognition of the Palestinian state will come into force in all three nations on May 28, with the prime ministers of the nations calling the move as an 'important step' towards \"peace\" in the region.\n\nThe Israeli embassy in Ireland, too, condemned the decision of Spain, Norway and Israel to recognise Palestinian statehood.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the Irish government's decision on recognition, which follows worrying initiatives and statements in recent months,\" Israel's Embassy in Dublin said in a statement on Wednesday, according to a CNN report.\n\nThe Israeli embassy said the decision \"brings more questions than answers\", alleging that recognising Palestinian statehood after the October 7 attacks conducted by Hamas \"sends a message\" that \"terrorism pays.\"\n\nIt warned that such a decision 'jeopardises' any possibility of Hamas releasing the hostages still being held in Gaza, CNN reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli foreign ministry shared a video on its social media channels and warned Ireland that it risked becoming a \"pawn\" of Hamas and Iran if it went ahead with its plan to recognise the Palestinian state.

Added to the request for arrest by the Prosecutor's Office of the International Criminal Court (ICC) or the threat by opposition leader Benny Gantz to leave the war cabinet, is the cascading recognition of the Palestinian State by several European countries, including Spain.\n\nThe recognition was announced this Wednesday, in a coordinated manner and a few minutes apart, by the heads of government of Spain, Norway and Ireland and will be materialized on May 28, also jointly. Slovenia, Luxembourg, Malta and Belgium are considering joining the initiative.\n\nWith Spain and Ireland, there will be four EU members that endorse the Palestinian State. They will join Cyprus and Sweden, which until now were the only members that had recognized Palestine, in 2011 and 2014 respectively, when they were already part of the European club. Other EU states recognized Palestine prior to EU membership; specifically, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - when they were united in Czechoslovakia -, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, which recognized under the communist regime. Malta also recognized Palestine in 1988, but its own Government does not consider it valid and is now considering doing so.\n\n\"There can be no peace in the Middle East without Israel and Palestine having their own state, it is the only real solution to the conflict,\" Norway's Labor Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said at a press conference in Oslo.\n\nWithin a few minutes of each other, in Dublin, the conservative taoiseach Simon Harris made the announcement, ensuring that Israel \"loses nothing\" with the recognition. \"We need the two-state solution, a solution that recognizes the State of Israel, that recognizes the State of Palestine,\" said Harris, accompanied by his two partners in the coalition of Christian Democrats, centrists and Greens, expressing confidence that this decision contributes to \"permanent peace\" in the Middle East.\n\nAlmost at the same time, from the tribune of Congress, Spanish President Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that \"the time had come to move from words to action\" and that Palestinian recognition echoes the \"majority sentiment of the Spanish people.\"\n\nAs expected, Israel did not waste a second in launching all its cavalry against the three governments and called its ambassadors in Madrid, Oslo and Dublin for consultations. \"Ireland and Norway intend to send a message to the Palestinians and the entire world today: terrorism is worth it,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement before the Spanish announcement. \"We are not deterred by the Irish-Norwegian parade of nonsense, we are determined to achieve our objectives: to restore the security of our citizens with the elimination of Hamas and the return of the abductees,\" Katz added.\n\nAfter S\u00e1nchez's speech, Israel also called the Israeli ambassador in Spain for consultations and summoned the Spanish ambassador. \"They have decided to award a gold medal to the Hamas murderers,\" denounced Katz, alluding to the terrorist attacks of October 7.\n\nInstead, the triple announcement was welcomed from the Palestinian side. The president of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, applauded the coordinated decision and stated that it is a contribution to the materialization of the two-state solution in order to end the conflict with Israel. The decision \"is consistent with the principles of international law, which recognizes the right of peoples to free themselves from colonialism and oppression and to live with freedom, justice and independence,\" Abas said, according to the official agency WAFA.\n\nFor his part, the secretary general of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hussein al-Sheikh, reacted by saying that we are living in \"historic moments in which the free world triumphs.\" Al Sheikh assured that the decision of Spain, Norway and Ireland comes \"after long decades of Palestinian national struggle, suffering, pain, racism, death, oppression, abuse and destruction to which the people of Palestine has been subjected.\"\n\nHamas also congratulated itself. In a statement, the extremist group indicated that the recognition of the Palestinian State is an \"important step\" to establish \"the right to their land\" with the aim of having \"Jerusalem as their capital.\" The Palestinian party, whose military wing fights against Israel in Gaza, called on the rest of the countries to \"support the cause of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence\" and to \"end the Zionist occupation.\"\n\nYesterday's multiple recognition unleashed the anger of the Israeli extreme right, which is part of Netanyahu's Government. In a new provocative gesture, the Minister of Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, yesterday visited the esplanade of the Jerusalem Mosques, where he recorded a video. \"The countries that recognized a Palestinian state this morning (yesterday) want to give a reward to the kidnappers of soldiers in observation posts and their many supporters in Gaza,\" Ben Gvir said in the recording.\n\nAnd the Minister of Finance, the ultra settler Bezalel Smotrich, proposed that the Government take several measures in retaliation; the most striking, creating a new settlement in the occupied territories by each nation that recognizes the Palestinian State.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After the Hamas terror organization carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after committing heinous sexual crimes witnessed by the world, these countries chose to reward Hamas and Iran by recognizing a Palestinian state,\" Katz continued.\n\n\"This distorted step by these countries is an injustice to the memory of the victims of 7/10, a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages, and a boost to Hamas and Iran's jihadists, which undermines the chance for peace and questions Israel's right to self-defense.\n\n\"Israel will not remain silent -- there will be further severe consequences. If Spain follows through on its intention to recognize a Palestinian state, a similar step will be taken against it.\n\n\"The Irish-Norwegian folly does not deter us; we are determined to achieve our goals: restoring security to our citizens, dismantling Hamas, and bringing the hostages home. There are no more just causes than these,\" Katz wrote.\n\nHamas welcomed the decision by the trio to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\n\"We consider this an important step towards affirming our right to our land,\" the terrorist group said in a statement, calling \"on countries around the world to recognize our legitimate national rights.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Authority also expressed support for the decision.", "source": {"uri": "vinnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "vinnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_feldman@vinnews.com", "name": "Joseph Feldman", "type": "author", "isAgency":

(Norwegian Government/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide highlighted the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nOSLO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Norway, Ireland and Spain announced on Wednesday that they would officially recognize Palestine as a state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Oslo, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Norway supports granting Palestine full membership status in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\"Norway's formal recognition of Palestine as a state will enter into force on May 28. There will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution. And there can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state. In other words, a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East,\" Store said.\n\nHe further explained that the territorial demarcation between Palestine and Israel should be based on the pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem serving as the capital for both states. This stance is without prejudice to a final settlement on borders, which may include land swaps.\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide highlighted the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. \"What is most urgent at the moment is to achieve a ceasefire, ensure that enough humanitarian aid reaches the people of Gaza, and obtain the release of the hostages,\" he said.\n\nA pedestrian walks past a Palestinian flag in Oslo, capital of Norway, May 22, 2024. (Photo by Chen Yaqin/Xinhua)\n\nOn the same day, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed that their countries would join Norway in recognizing the State of Palestine.\n\n\"Today Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the State of Palestine, each of us will undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision,\" Harris said in Dublin, the Irish capital.\n\nThe Irish prime minister said that \"permanent peace can only be secured upon the basis of the free will of a free people.\"\n\n\"Palestinians in Gaza are enduring the most appalling, suffering, hardship and starvation,\" he said. \"A humanitarian catastrophe, unimaginable to most, and unconscionable to all -- is unfolding in real time.\"\n\nSpain's recognition will also take effect on May 28, following a Council of Ministers session. Sanchez stressed that Spain recognizes Palestine \"for peace, for justice, and for consistency,\" urging both parties to engage in dialogue to achieve a two-state solution. He highlighted the necessity of ending reported abuses in the occupied territories.\n\nThe Palestinian presidency on Wednesday welcomed the recognition. In a statement published by the official news agency WAFA, the Palestinian leadership stated that it highly appreciated the contribution of Norway, Ireland and Spain towards \"consecrating the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination on their land and in taking actual steps to support the implementation of the two-state solution.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he has instructed the immediate recall of Israel's ambassadors to Ireland and Norway for consultations in light of the countries' decisions to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\n\"I'm sending a clear and unequivocal message to Ireland and Norway: Israel will not remain silent in the face of those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security,\" Katz said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nEuropean reactions to the recognition varied. Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia expressed support, with Slovenia also initiating steps towards recognizing Palestine.\n\nThe Slovenian government launched on May 9 procedures for Slovenia's recognition of Palestine. Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon expressed hope that the procedures would be completed as soon as possible, as Slovenia wants to help ensure an end to the horrors in Gaza.\n\nA spokesperson from Malta's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Xinhua that Malta had recently affirmed its readiness to recognize Palestine but will wait until such recognition can make a positive contribution, when the circumstances are right.\n\nSlovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said his country supported the resolution on strengthening the rights of the State of Palestine. \"It is the only way to achieve sustainable peace in the region and confirm the historic right of Palestine to self-determination as well as a place in the UN,\" he said in a statement.\n\nConversely, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Lithuania expressed reservations.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said that it makes no sense to recognize Palestine as a state if it is not clear who represents it and on what territory.\n\nThe UN Security Council holds a meeting on the situation in Gaza at the UN headquarters in New York, on May 20, 2024. (Manuel Elias/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nThe Dutch government commented it does not recognize the State of Palestine and is not expected to change its position in the near future.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda warned that recognizing Palestinian statehood could escalate the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn Belgium, top ministers also met to consider the situation in Gaza, but no agreement on a possible recognition was reached.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said such recognition is not a taboo while stressing the timing, saying conditions had not yet been met. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also made a similar statement.\n\nIndependent EU commentator and analyst Shada Islam said that the recognition of a Palestinian state by Norway, Ireland and Spain is almost certainly going to be followed by Malta and Slovenia in the coming weeks.\n\n\"The move by Spain, Ireland and Norway will further isolate Israel in the UN... Their decision sends a strong message to Palestinian people that at least some EU member states have retained their moral compass,\" she told Xinhua. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn",

Smotrich, a leader known for opposing Palestinian sovereignty, cited the actions of Spain, Norway, and Ireland as justification for the move.\n\nIn a statement, Smotrich informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that tax revenues would no longer be sent to the authority, which governs parts of the West Bank in cooperation with Israel. The decision threatens to exacerbate the Palestinian government's financial woes.\n\nPayback for Spain, Ireland and Norway's decision\n\nEytan Fuld, a spokesperson for Smotrich, emphasized that the decision was partly a reaction to the European countries' recognition of Palestinian statehood.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government opposes Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was the second blow to Israel's international reputation this week after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The International Court of Justice is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor also seeks arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. The fighting killed about 1,200 people and Palestinian militants took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael's ensuing offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and caused a humanitarian crisis and a near-famine. The ICC prosecutor accuses Israeli leaders of using starvation as a weapon.\n\nIn response to the announcements in Europe, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir paid a provocative visit Wednesday to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound -- a flashpoint in Jerusalem that is sacred to Muslims and Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nIn further retaliation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he would stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The move threatens to handicap its already waning ability to pay salaries to thousands of employees.\n\nUnder interim peace accords in the 1990s, Israel collects tax revenue on behalf of the Palestinians, and it has used the money as a tool to pressure the PA. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Smotrich froze the transfers, but Israel agreed to send the money to Norway, which transferred it to the PA.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the cutoff was \"wrong\" because it \"destabilizes the West Bank\" and undermines \"the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe international community views the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations.\n\nThe formal recognition by Norway, Spain and Ireland -- which all have a record of friendly ties with both the Israelis and the Palestinians -- is planned for May 28.\n\nTheir announcements came in swift succession. Norway, which helped broker the Oslo accords that kicked off the peace process in the 1990s, was the first.\n\n\"There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition,\" said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.\n\nThe country plans to upgrade its representative office in the West Bank to an embassy.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris called it a \"historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine,\" saying the announcements had been coordinated and other countries might join.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who announced his country's decision before parliament, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the decisions and called on other nations to \"recognize our legitimate rights and support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence.\"\n\nHamas, which Western countries and Israel view as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel's existence but has indicated it might agree to a state on the 1967 lines, at least on an interim basis. Israel claims any Palestinian state would be at risk of being taken over by Hamas, posing a threat to its security.\n\nThe announcements are unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza -- or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem and considers it part of its capital, and in the occupied West Bank it has built scores of Jewish settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis.\n\nThe settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule.\n\nPhotos: Israeli-Palestinian conflict eight months long Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

"body": "JERUSALEM (AFP): Israel reacted with fury after three European countries said Wednesday they would recognise a Palestinian state, more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war.\n\nIreland, Norway and Spain said they would formally recognise the State of Palestine on May 28, drawing praise from many Arab and Muslim states.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move amounted to a \"reward for terror\", after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its October 7 attack which sparked the Gaza war.\n\nIsrael said it was recalling its envoys to Dublin, Oslo and Madrid for \"urgent consultations\" and also summoned the three European ambassadors for a rebuke.\n\nEuropean Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell posted on X that he would work with the bloc's 27 members \"to promote a common EU position based on a 2-state solution\".\n\nIsrael's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, on his first visit since October 7 to the contested religious site of the Temple Mount in the Old City of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, said the recognition rewarded \"murderers and aggressors\".\n\nHis visits to the site -- known as the Al-Aqsa mosque compound to Muslims -- have been cited by Hamas as one reason for the group's October attack on Israel, which it called \"Al-Aqsa Flood\".\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden opposed unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, saying it should be realised \"through direct negotiations\".\n\nBiden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned Israel not to withhold funding intended for the Palestinian Authority in retaliation.\n\nMost Western governments, including the United States, say they are willing to recognise Palestinian statehood one day -- but not before thorny issues such as final borders and the status of Jerusalem are settled.\n\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said \"recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict\".\n\n\"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security.\"\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Netanyahu was \"causing so much pain, destruction and resentment in Gaza and the rest of Palestine that the two-state solution is in danger\".\n\nAnd Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the October 7 attack \"barbaric\" but stressed that \"a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment\".\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Authority, which rules parts of the occupied West Bank, 142 of the 193 UN member countries already recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization, seen internationally as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, hailed Wednesday's moves as \"historical\".\n\nHamas also welcomed \"an important step towards affirming our right to our land\", while Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas political bureau member, said it would mark \"a turning point in the international position on the Palestinian issue\".\n\nA Palestinian in Gaza's southern city of Rafah, Ismail Hassuna, 46, said the European trio's decision was a step that \"will restore hope\" and should help in efforts to \"stop Israel from its heinous crimes\".\n\nPolitical analyst Ines Abdul Razek, who heads the Palestine Institute for Public Democracy, called the decision symbolic but \"not a great victory\".\n\nShe said what was needed was \"actual measures, including sanctions and arms embargoes\" against Israel.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also took 252 hostages, 124 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nOn Wednesday a hostages campaign group released footage of five Israeli female soldiers being captured by militants on October 7 and taken away.\n\nSpeaking about the video, Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting Hamas to \"ensure what we have seen tonight never happens again\".\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,709 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nIsrael also imposed a siege that has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most water, food, medical and fuel supplies, and brought much of the population to the brink of famine.\n\nFierce fighting has raged around Rafah, the last part of Gaza to face a ground invasion, where an AFP team reported more bombardment early Wednesday.\n\nHeavy battles have also rocked Gaza's northern and central areas where Hamas forces have regrouped, and more Israeli strikes have hit Gaza City, Jabalia and Zeitun.\n\nIsrael said its troops were fighting on the ground in Rafah and Jabalia, and three more soldiers were killed on Wednesday, bringing the army's toll since the ground offensive began on October 27 to 287.\n\nTen people were killed in the central town of Al-Zawaida overnight, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said, and Gaza's civil defence agency said six bodies were recovered from the rubble of a house in Jabalia.\n\nIsrael's military said soldiers had carried out targeted raids on dozens of Hamas military compounds in Jabalia.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said northern Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, were besieged, trapping more than 200 patients.\n\nIsraeli troops began their ground assault on Rafah early this month, defying international opposition over fears for the more than one million civilians trapped there.\n\nIsrael ordered mass evacuations from Rafah, and the UN says more than 800,000 people have fled.\n\nHeavy fighting has also rocked the other major Palestinian territory, the occupied West Bank, where an Israeli raid entered its second day in the city of Jenin.\n\nThe Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry said Israeli forces had killed 10 people since the fighting began on Tuesday morning.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [],

That is how, this Wednesday, Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced the date on which Spain will recognize Palestine as a state, thus solidifying the promise of recognition that the prime minister had already made several times in recent weeks. In an appearance in the Congress of Deputies, the Spanish prime minister commented with regret on the increase in Russian and Israeli offensives in Ukrainian and Palestinian territory, respectively. And he justified that, for moral reasons, Spain has been obliged to deliver its support to Palestine in the same way as it does to Ukraine.\n\n\"It is clear to me that Benjamin Netenyahu does not have a peace project for Palestine,\" he said, in addition to asserting that the \"legitimate\" fight against Hamas has ended up resulting in a response of \"terror\" on the part of Israel, which \"means that the viability of the two-state solution is at risk.\" To further justify the decision to recognize the Palestinian state next week, S\u00e1nchez recalled that the prosecutor of the International Court of Justice in The Hague demanded the arrest of the Israeli prime minister. \"The request for a ceasefire is not enough,\" argued the Socialist leader.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez appeared this Wednesday in the Congress of Deputies at his own request. He did so to address three issues: to report on the last meeting of the European Council, to convey to Congress Spain's position regarding the recognition of the Palestinian state, and to give explanations about the business activities of his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez. Regarding this last issue, the PM's remarks come 24 hours after the Civil Guard ruled out that there were any signs of criminal activity in the businesses of the Spanish PM's wife.\n\nHe also appeared before the deputies of the lower house almost a month after he announced through a letter addressed to the public that he was going to leave public view for five days within the Moncloa government residence to \"reflect\" on his continuity at the head of the Spanish government. In fact, this Wednesday, he asked all parliamentarians to \"put a stop to the escalating insults and lies to other speakers\". \"We must practice fair play, by going for the ball and not the players\", he implored, amid the noise from the opposition People's Party (PP).\n\nIn fact, at the last European leaders' summit, a cease-fire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, as well as the opening of humanitarian corridors to provide aid to the Palestinian population, were again called for. The need for a two-state solution to guarantee the security of the region was also reiterated. In recent weeks there had been speculation about the possibility that on Tuesday 21st May some European states, including Spain, would recognize the Palestinian state. But last Friday Pedro S\u00e1nchez ruled out this possibility and assured that the decision would be made \"in the coming days\".\n\nThis Wednesday, Ireland and Norway also announced that they will recognize Palestine as an independent state on May 28th. The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, stated in a press conference that \"there can be no peace in the Middle East without Israel and Palestine having their own states\". \"It's the only real solution to the conflict,\" the Norwegian leader told the media. His Irish counterpart, the taoiseach Simon Harris, said the measure was taken to achieve \"permanent peace\" between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIn the EU, at the moment, there are only nine countries that recognize the state of Palestine: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Slovakia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Sweden, which did so in 2004. Now, Spain and Ireland join them, and non-EU member Norway also adds another European voice. In the UN, a full 143 states out of the 193 United Nations members already recognize the state of Palestine.\n\nThe first Israeli reaction to today's move by Ireland, Norway and Spain came immediately: the foreign minister of Israel, Israel Katz, recalled the country's ambassadors to all three countries for consultations after the coordinated announcement that these nations will recognize Palestine as a state on May 28th. \"They have decided to award a gold medal to the killers from Hamas,\" he denounced in a statement. \"There will be further severe consequences for the three countries if they follow through on this announcement,\" said Katz.", "source": {"uri": "elnacional.cat", "dataType": "news", "title": "ElNacional.cat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

intends to take immediate action to cut off the transfer of funds to the Ramallah-based authority.\n\nHe said he asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to impose \"additional economic sanctions on PA senior officials and their families.\"\n\n\"At the last cabinet meeting, many ministers, including myself, raised an unequivocal demand for harsh punitive measures against the Palestinian Authority

return earns a commission of 3%.\n\nThe revenues are estimated to total around $188 million every month and represent the main source of income for the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe announcement of state recognition by the three European countries comes as Israel continued its brutal offensive on the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, 2023 despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the enclave.\n\nMore than 35,700 Palestinians have been killed, the vast majority of whom have been women and children, and nearly 80,000 others injured since last October following an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nMore than seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael is

It is understood that options which include restricting access for Irish NGOs to the West Bank, and to Gaza after the conflict, will be on the table.\n\nIsraeli foreign minister Yisrael Katz described the move as \"a parade of stupidity\" and said that its message was \"terrorism pays\". He warned of \"dire consequences\".\n\n\"I am sending a clear message today: Israel will not be complacent against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security,\" he said.\n\nBut Palestinian representatives hailed the move.\n\nPalestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of Fatah - which controls the West Bank part of Palestinian territory, but not the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas - spoke to Taoiseach Simon Harris in a telephone call and told him that the recognition was \"a beacon of hope to the Palestinian people\", in an account supplied by Government Buildings in Dublin.\n\nMr Harris told Mr Abbas that the move was intended to keep the hopes of a two-state peace solution between Israel and Palestine alive.\n\nMr Harris told Mr Abbas that Hamas is a brutal terrorist organisation and he utterly condemned the barbaric attack on Israel on October 7th last, officials said.\n\nAnnouncing the decision on Wednesday morning at Government Buildings, Mr Harris compared the efforts to secure recognition of Palestinian statehood to similar efforts by the fledgling independent Irish State a century ago to gain international recognition.\n\n\"Taking our place on the world stage - and being recognised by others as having the right to be there - was a matter of the highest importance for the founders of our State,\" he said.\n\n[ Why Ireland is recognising the state of Palestine, how it happened and what it means for Irish-Israeli relations ]\n\n[ View from Jerusalem: Some Israelis see Ireland as simply naive; others think it is anti-Semitic ]\n\n\"Recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value. It is an expression of our view that Palestine holds and should be able to vindicate the full rights of a state - including self-determination, self-governance, territorial integrity and security - as well as recognising Palestine's own obligations under international law.\"\n\nIn Norway, the prime minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re made a similar announcement while the Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez told the Spanish Parliament also framed the move as an attempt to bolster a two-state solution. But also suggested it was a response to the Israeli assault on Gaza.\n\n\"It's time to move from words to action,\" Mr Sanchez said, \"to tell millions of innocent Palestinians who are suffering that we are with them, that there is hope.\"\n\nOfficials in Dublin said that it is hoped that more European countries will soon make a similar move. More than 140 countries already recognise a Palestinian state, but most EU countries, and the United States, do not.\n\nIn Washington, the White House voiced disapproval, but did not condemn the move outright. President Joe Biden \"believes a Palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition\", a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe announcement, which had been repeatedly flagged in recent weeks, was praised throughout the Arab world.\n\nA senior Hamas figure, Bassem Naim, also endorsed the move.\n\n\"These successive recognitions are the direct result of this brave resistance and the legendary steadfastness of the Palestinian people,\" he told AFP, a response expected by Irish officials, they said.", "source": {"uri":

But it is not a good time for Israeli diplomacy\n\nAs far as most Israelis are concerned, the recognition by Ireland and other European states of a Palestinian state is essentially an exercise in futility. A Palestinian state does not exist so how can you recognise it?\n\nSome Israelis view the Irish as well-meaning but na\u00efve in the extreme: others view Dublin as traditionally anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic.\n\nIsrael feels betrayed by Ireland. There is a widespread feeling that in Israel's greatest hour of need, after the biggest disaster to befall the Jewish people since the Holocaust, Dublin should stand side by side with Israel. Instead it is supporting a Palestinian state which most Israelis believe, rightly or wrongly, would quickly develop into a radical Hamas state along Israel's border: Gaza on steroids. Such a scenario will not bring peace closer, a majority of Israelis would argue, but could be the final death blow to prospects for ending the Middle East conflict.\n\nA survey by the Israel Democracy Institute in February found that around two-thirds of Jewish respondents (63%) oppose an independent Palestinian state even if it is demilitarised, although a large majority of Israel's Arab minority (73%) support it.\n\nA Palestinian state is further away today than it has been for many years. Even many in the (rapidly shrinking) peace camp in Israel believe prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's mantra that to express support for a Palestinian state today is akin to granting a prize to the Hamas gunmen who committed the atrocities on October 7th.\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate Ireland's announcement that it will recognise a Palestinian state came just a few days after Israel had received its best offer yet to accept Palestinian statehood. It was brought by US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who flew to Israel from Saudi Arabia with a deal that has been in the works for months.\n\nIsraeli leaders were told that Riyadh would be willing to normalise ties as part of a package that includes regional security pacts (aimed against Iran), advanced US weapons systems for the Saudis but with two concessions from Israel: an end to the Gaza war and agreeing to a Palestinian state.\n\nPrime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said no. He is not prepared to end the war at this juncture, and will not accept a Palestinian state even at the cost of rejecting the jewel in the crown in Israel's quest for regional acceptance, relations with Saudi Arabia.\n\nNetanyahu is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state and he knows that agreeing to such a scenario will lead to the end of his right-wing coalition and, in all likelihood, the end of his political career.\n\nIt's been a bad week for Israeli diplomacy. The recognition of a Palestinian state followed the recommendation by International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant, along with Hamas leaders, a move that was condemned almost across the political spectrum in Israel as a moral outrage.\n\nIncreasingly Israel feels diplomatically isolated and there is a growing feeling of Israel against the world. In such an environment it is not easy for Israeli leaders to make concessions - concessions that may be essential to reach a ceasefire and hostage-release deal. Israel's opponents could argue that the country's isolation gives its leaders an excuse not to make concessions that they had no intention of making anyway.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com",

The very least that the Irish Government, along with others, could have done is made that recognition conditional on the return of the hostages. However, the alacrity with which this decision was made would suggest these unfortunates were not even considered. - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - Following our recognition of the state of Palestine, will be now begin to accept huge numbers of Palestinian refugees?\n\nWill we be welcoming them with open tents? - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - During the declaration by the Taoiseach to formally recognise the state of Palestine, Simon Harris compared the situation to Ireland's own declaration of statehood in 1919. We would do well to remember what followed. The War of Independence, the Civil War, shootings, killings, the Border campaign of the Fifties, and the Troubles, which were not confined to the Six Counties. There is a very long road ahead. - Yours, etc,\n\nA chara, - The recent decision of the Government to recognise a Palestinian state is at best misguided and at worst foolish and will do nothing to end the conflict. How can such a state be recognised when there are no agreed borders? Hillary Clinton, the former Us secretary of state, recently pointed out that the Palestinians have always rejected a so-called two-state solution whenever they were offered one. The reason is obvious as they want to see the destruction of Israel, the only democratic state in the region. This move will be seen as a reward for terrorism. The only way peace can be achieved is if the two sides agree it themselves and not by external governments that have no role in the process. - Is mise,\n\nSir, - It's good to see Ireland playing a leading role among the adults in the room, while others are throwing their toys out of the pram. - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - The option to declare a \"Palestinian state\" has been available to the Arab League initially since 1948 and the Palestinian Authority, more recently, but they have chosen not to declare one. Even today the Palestinian government has not declared a state. But Ireland, Norway and Spain have recognised a state that hasn't been declared yet? I'm curious to know who governs this \"state\", is it Fatah or Hamas? Does it have a constitution? A legal system, and do women have full rights now? Is there a free press? Were Hamas part of the discussions, given Hamas controls half of this \"state\"?\n\nWho are these governments speaking to in \"Palestine\" with regard to future free and fair elections and what's the plan if (or when) Hamas wins those elections? Who are the representatives from the Palestine side presenting peace plans? Who is their John Hume?\n\nOr is it a pointless gesture and a PR stunt that won't make a jot of difference to creating the environment for a peace settlement in that region? - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - I write this letter with a heavy heart, as a woman who has always been a proud to be Irish. However, the recent decision by our government to recognize a Palestinian state has left me disillusioned and deeply troubled.\n\nThe recognition of a Palestinian State, in my view, is tantamount to rewarding terrorism. It's a decision that has shaken my faith in the principles that our nation stands for. Terrorism, in any form, is a threat to peace and stability, and it is disheartening to see our Government seemingly endorse a group that has not shied away from such tactics.\n\nDrawing parallels between the Palestinian cause and the Irish fight for independence from British rule is, in my opinion, a gross oversimplification. The Irish struggle was never about the destruction of Britain, but rather the removal of its rule over Ireland. In stark contrast, there are factions within the Palestinian leadership that openly call for the destruction of Israel, a stance that is fundamentally incompatible with the pursuit of peace.\n\nWhen Ireland secured independence, the vast majority of Irish people accepted the reality that it was better to rule over most of the country in peace than to continue a bloody conflict. Yet the Palestinians have rejected numerous opportunities for peace and have turned Gaza into the world's leading hotbed of terrorism and the West Bank a close second.\n\nThe Belfast Agreement, a landmark in our history, included the IRA renouncing its belief in armed conflict. This was a crucial step towards lasting peace. However, since the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians have not demonstrated a similar commitment to peace, continuing to advocate for armed conflict, the destruction of the state of Israel and the genocide of the Jews. I write not to incite controversy, but to express my deep concern over the direction our beloved country is taking. I believe that we, as a nation, must stand against terrorism in all its forms and promote peace and understanding, rather than endorsing entities that propagate violence and openly call for genocide. History will not judge Ireland and its leaders favourably for the decision it has taken. - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - Further to \"Recognition of a Palestinian state 'an act of pure folly', says Irish Jewish leader\" (News, May 22nd), Maurice Cohen claims that the recognition of a Palestinian state amounts to the rewarding of a terrorist organisation. I don't accept that but if it were true then the new Palestinian state has something in common with Israel. The recognition of the state of Israel was a complex process. Various factors were obviously at play but the terrorist activities of Haganah, Irgun and Lehi played no small part in the recognition of Israel. - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - The decision by Ireland, Norway and Spain to recognise the state of Palestinian is a historic day for the people of Palestine.\n\nIt may not bring peace today or tomorrow but will undoubtedly pave the way for a just and lasting solution for peace in the region.\n\nFurthermore, it will be an important step in ending Hamas's reign of terror and any legitimacy it may harbour over the cause of the oppressed people of Palestine. - Yours, etc,\n\nA chara, - I wish to congratulate the T\u00e1naiste on his tireless work to find a solution to the war in Palestine. Miche\u00e1l Martin has engaged with all the main players in this tragic and dreadful conflict. I believe that he is now well positioned and has the bona fides to go to Hamas and try to get the Israeli hostages released. This would be a major building block on the road to a ceasefire. He is trusted and respected throughout the Middle East so he should, in my view, seize the moment and engage with Hamas. - Is mise,\n\nSir, - The recognition of Palestine raises some serious questions, particularly in regard to its timing. Why grant recognition now, less than a year after the devastating attack on Israel by Hamas? With support for Fatah in freefall since the attack, the only possible Palestinian state which could emerge is a Hamas-led one. Why are we supporting this terrorist group and rewarding them for violence? - Yours, etc,\n\nSir, - Taoiseach Simon Harris says recognising a Palestinian state is the \"only credible path to peace between Israel and Palestine\".\n\nWell over a hundred countries have previously recognised a Palestinian state, with little difference to the conflict, and it is highly unlikely an Irish recognition will change anything.\n\nIt is telling that Hamas has welcomed the Irish decision, and there is little doubt this decision will embolden Hamas and extremists within Palestinian society to redouble their efforts to attack Israel as these efforts have, in their eyes, been rewarded. - Yours, etc,", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

Squeezed by Israel, the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority in the West Bank struggles to pay its own civil servants.\n\nBut it follows a steady build-up of problems, from Washington's warnings over withholding arms if the war in Gaza continues and sanctions against violent settlers to accusations of genocide before the International Court of Justice and a possible arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the International Criminal Court.\n\nNetanyahu has long resisted the so-called two-state solution and his resistance has increased since he went into government with a clutch of hard right religious nationalist parties at the end of 2022.\n\nHis government remains deeply suspicious of the Palestinian Authority, set up three decades ago under the Oslo interim peace accords, accusing it of hostile actions from paying the families of armed militants killed by Israeli forces to encouraging antisemitism in schoolbooks.\n\nNetanyahu himself described the decision by the three countries as \"a reward for terrorism\", and said a Palestinian state would \"try to repeat the massacre of Oct. 7 again and again.\"\n\nThat comment underlined how bitter the climate surrounding the war in Gaza has become and how distant the prospects of a political settlement based on an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel now appear, with peace talks seemingly hopelessly blocked.\n\nAs well as recalling its ambassadors from Oslo, Madrid and Dublin, the foreign ministry summoned the Norwegian, Irish and Spanish ambassadors in Israel to be shown video footage of the attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7.\n\nLaura Blumenfeld, a Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the three countries' decision was \"diplomatically bold but emotionally tone deaf and unproductive.\"\n\n\"For Israelis it will increase paranoia, reinforcing Netanyahu's argument that Israelis stand alone,\" she said. \"For Palestinians, it falsely raises expectations, without defining a pathway toward realizing legitimate national dreams.\"\n\nLONGER TERM PRICE\n\nFor Netanyahu, struggling to hold together a fractious wartime coalition and widely blamed in Israel for the disaster of Oct. 7, Wednesday's announcement may provide a temporary lift, by reinforcing an image of defiance in the face of a hostile world.\n\n\"This really strengthens the narrative which we have been hearing since Day One of this war that in the end, we can only depend on ourselves,\" said Yonatan Freeman, an international relations specialist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \"And I think that this can even assist the Israeli government's explanation and description of what it's doing in this war.\"\n\nHowever, the longer term price to Israel of standing in the way of moves towards a Palestinian state may be heavier, starting with the prized goal of normalized relations with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu's top foreign policy goal before the attack.\n\nAppearing before a Senate committee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that for an agreement to be reached with Saudi Arabia, there would have to be calm in Gaza and a \"credible pathway\" towards a Palestinian state.\n\n\"And it may well be...that, in this moment, Israel is not able or willing to proceed down that pathway,\" he added.\n\nFor Israelis, the images of Oct. 7, when Hamas-led gunmen rampaged through communities around the Gaza Strip, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages into captivity, remain deeply traumatic.\n\nBut outside Israel, the images of the suffering in Gaza, where the relentless Israeli campaign launched in response has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the heavily built up enclave, have helped fuel an expanding protest movement on U.S. college campuses and the streets of European cities.\n\nFor both the U.S. administration and other governments like Germany that have traditionally been friendly to Israel, the often angry protests have imposed an increasingly heavy political cost.\n\nBoth countries say recognising a Palestinian state must be the result of negotiations rather than unilateral declarations, and other major European countries like France and Britain also declined to join the trio granting recognition.\n\nBut for Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's foreign ministry and a critic of Netanyahu's government, the recognition of Palestine by individual countries was less important than the broader context, including cases against Israel and its leaders at the international tribunals in the Hague.\n\n\"If it's part of a wider move that's triggering momentum and part of the ICC, ICJ moves, sanctions on settlers and so on, there's a chance that Israel will notice that the world exists,\" he said.

And most European governments offered unequivocal support to the International Criminal Court this week after it requested arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and defense minister, along with leaders of Hamas.\n\nIsrael still has staunch allies within the European Union, especially Hungary and the Czech Republic, and key players like Germany, despite growing discomfort with Israel's conduct, have not shown any inclination to alter their stance. The growing fissures within Europe mean that the consensus-driven European Union will not change its positions any time soon.\n\nBut European countries face rising international and domestic pressure to take a firmer stand against Israel's handling of the Palestinian territories and particularly the devastating war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAmong European Union members, Sweden has for a decade stood alone in recognizing Palestinian statehood. Europe has long supported the eventual creation of a Palestinian state -- the \"two-state solution\" that Israel's government steadfastly opposes -- and voiced frustration with Israeli handling of Gaza and the occupied West Bank, but most nations have been unwilling to go further.\n\nInstead, the European Union, before the war, was moving closer to Israel, including through financially and politically important partnerships in trade and science.\n\nThe war, and the way it has evolved, are changing that. The sympathetic views that sustained European support for Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks are waning as the war continues, the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens, and Israel looks to many people less like a victim and more like an aggressor.\n\nIreland and Spain, EU members, and Norway, a nation closely aligned with the bloc, took the next step Wednesday, recognizing Palestinian statehood -- a sharp rebuke to Israel, even if it has little practical effect and came as little surprise. The three European countries have been vocal in their criticism of Israel and support of the Palestinian cause, even as they have condemned Hamas and the brutal assault it led against Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIf more of their neighbors follow their lead, the EU could become a major counterweight to the US position that Palestinian statehood should only result from a negotiated settlement with Israel. That would deepen the rift between Europe and Israel.\n\nThere has been a growing chorus of warnings and concerns from EU members about Israel's deadly and destructive campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Particular attention now turns to Belgium, another deeply pro-Palestinian EU country that has stepped up its criticism of how Israel is handling the war.\n\nThe European Union as a bloc has maintained its trade and other agreements with Israel despite growing calls to sever or drastically limit them.\n\nThe majority of the 27 EU countries have held largely similar positions on the Israel-Hamas war since Oct. 7 and undergone similar shifts.\n\nThey began with revulsion at the Hamas-led attack that killed an estimated 1,200 people and captured more than 240 hostages, support for Israel's right to defend itself, and continued hope for a two-state solution. They called for restraint by Israel as it bombarded, blockaded, and invaded Gaza. Then came outright, increasingly sharp criticism of an Israeli campaign that has killed about 35,000 people -- combatants and civilians -- forced most civilians in Gaza to flee their homes, caused shortages of food and medicines, and leveled many of the territory's buildings.\n\nIn standing by Israel, countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic may play a decisive role in determining what the EU can and -- especially -- what it cannot do when it comes to the Middle East. Austria, too, has remained close to Israel while others have criticized it.\n\nForeign policy is a national prerogative jealously guarded by EU members that cede many other powers to the bloc. The group's positions in international affairs can only be reached by unanimous consensus, making it unlikely that it will take a clear position on Israel and Palestine any time soon.\n\nWhen the International Criminal Court's prosecutor Monday requested arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel, most European countries, and the EU itself, stopped short of taking an overt position on the move but said that they respected the court's independence.\n\nBut the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, said on social media that seeking the arrest of \"the representatives of a democratically elected government together with the leaders of an Islamist terrorist organization is appalling and completely unacceptable.\"\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary called it \"absurd and shameful.\"\n\nBut Belgium's foreign minister, Hadja Lahbib, said, \"Crimes committed in Gaza must be prosecuted at the highest level, regardless of the perpetrators.\"\n\nThe foreign ministry of France, the bloc's second-largest nation, said that \"France supports the International Criminal Court, its independence, and the fight against impunity in all situations.\"\n\nRecognizing a Palestinian state is \"not taboo\" for France, but the right moment has not yet come, the French foreign minister said Wednesday after several European countries officially took the step. \"This decision must be useful,\" St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, the foreign minister, said in a statement.\n\nThough France has refrained from acting on its own, last month it voted in favor of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize Palestine as a full member state of the UN. Britain, no longer in the EU but still influential, abstained in that vote.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They also came amid efforts by the Biden administration and Congress to coordinate a response to a decision by the international criminal court (ICC) to seek an arrest warrant for Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over Israeli actions in Gaza.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about Israel's diplomatic isolation, Sullivan - who is due to visit the country in the coming days - answered affirmatively.\n\n\"I think it's a fair question,\" he said. \"As a country that stands strong in defense of Israel in international forums like the United Nations, we certainly have seen a growing chorus of voices, including voices that had previously been in support of Israel, drift in another direction. That is of concern to us because we do not believe that that contributes to Israel's long term security or vitality ... So that's something we have discussed with the Israeli government.\"\n\nThe best way to address it, Sullivan said, was for Israel to pursue a strategy of defeating Hamas in Gaza while seeking to protect civilians and ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid. At the same time, Israel should embrace a two-state solution - something Netanyahu's government fiercely opposes - as part of a regional settlement that would see Israel peacefully integrated with moderate Arab states.\n\nHowever, Sullivan appeared critical of the Irish-Norwegian-Spanish move to recognise Palestinian statehood, saying the goal could only be achieved through a negotiated agreement.\n\n\"President Biden ... has been on the record supporting a two state solution. He has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe the only way that you are going to achieve a two-state solution that delivers for both Israelis and Palestinians is through direct negotiations between the parties.\"\n\nNevertheless, he criticised Israel's decision to respond to the tripartite recognition by withholding funds from the Palestinian Authority, saying: \"I think it's wrong on a strategic basis because withholding funds destabilises the West Bank. It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people, which is in Israel's interests. And I think it's wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people.\"\n\nSullivan expanded on comments to the Senate foreign relations committee by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Tuesday in which he said the administration was ready to work with Congress on enacting potential penalties against the ICC in response to its bid to seek Netanyahu's arrest.\n\n\"We're in consultations on a bipartisan, bicameral basis with [Capitol] Hill on all of the options for how to respond to what the ICC has just done. We haven't made any determinations,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThe ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced on Monday that he was pursuing warrants for Netanyahu's arrest, as well as that of the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and three senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, and Ismael Haniyeh.\n\nThe move was denounced as \"outrageous\" by Biden, who said it assumed a false moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas, which is officially designated as a terrorist group by the US, Britain and the European Union.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate and House of Representatives have publicly mooted legislation against the ICC, of which the US is not a member, although it has supported some of its previous attempts at mounting prosecutions, notably against the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAround 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 kidnapped when Hamas, which has run Gaza since 2007, staged a surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October last year. Some 36,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Israel's military response.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

Squeezed by Israel, the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority in the West Bank struggles to pay its own civil servants.\n\nBut it follows a steady build-up of problems, from Washington's warnings over withholding arms if the war in Gaza continues and sanctions against violent settlers to accusations of genocide before the International Court of Justice and a possible arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the International Criminal Court.\n\nNetanyahu has long resisted the so-called two-state solution and his resistance has increased since he went into government with a clutch of hard right religious nationalist parties at the end of 2022.\n\nHis government remains deeply suspicious of the Palestinian Authority, set up three decades ago under the Oslo interim peace accords, accusing it of hostile actions from paying the families of armed militants killed by Israeli forces to encouraging antisemitism in schoolbooks.\n\nNetanyahu himself described the decision by the three countries as \"a reward for terrorism\", and said a Palestinian state would \"try to repeat the massacre of Oct. 7 again and again.\"\n\nThat comment underlined how bitter the climate surrounding the war in Gaza has become and how distant the prospects of a political settlement based on an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel now appear, with peace talks seemingly hopelessly blocked.\n\nAs well as recalling its ambassadors from Oslo, Madrid and Dublin, the foreign ministry summoned the Norwegian, Irish and Spanish ambassadors in Israel to be shown video footage of the attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7.\n\nLaura Blumenfeld, a Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the three countries' decision was \"diplomatically bold but emotionally tone deaf and unproductive.\"\n\n\"For Israelis it will increase paranoia, reinforcing Netanyahu's argument that Israelis stand alone,\" she said. \"For Palestinians, it falsely raises expectations, without defining a pathway toward realizing legitimate national dreams.\"\n\nLONGER TERM PRICE\n\nFor Netanyahu, struggling to hold together a fractious wartime coalition and widely blamed in Israel for the disaster of Oct. 7, Wednesday's announcement may provide a temporary lift, by reinforcing an image of defiance in the face of a hostile world.\n\n\"This really strengthens the narrative which we have been hearing since Day One of this war that in the end, we can only depend on ourselves,\" said Yonatan Freeman, an international relations specialist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \"And I think that this can even assist the Israeli government's explanation and description of what it's doing in this war.\"\n\nHowever, the longer term price to Israel of standing in the way of moves towards a Palestinian state may be heavier, starting with the prized goal of normalized relations with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu's top foreign policy goal before the attack.\n\nAppearing before a Senate committee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that for an agreement to be reached with Saudi Arabia, there would have to be calm in Gaza and a \"credible pathway\" towards a Palestinian state.\n\n\"And it may well be...that, in this moment, Israel is not able or willing to proceed down that pathway,\" he added.\n\nFor Israelis, the images of Oct. 7, when Hamas-led gunmen rampaged through communities around the Gaza Strip, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages into captivity, remain deeply traumatic.\n\nBut outside Israel, the images of the suffering in Gaza, where the relentless Israeli campaign launched in response has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the heavily built up enclave, have helped fuel an expanding protest movement on U.S. college campuses and the streets of European cities.\n\nFor both the U.S. administration and other governments like Germany that have traditionally been friendly to Israel, the often angry protests have imposed an increasingly heavy political cost.\n\nBoth countries say recognising a Palestinian state must be the result of negotiations rather than unilateral declarations, and other major European countries like France and Britain also declined to join the trio granting recognition.\n\nBut for Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's foreign ministry and a critic of Netanyahu's government, the recognition of Palestine by individual countries was less important than the broader context, including cases against Israel and its leaders at the international tribunals in the Hague.\n\n\"If it's part of a wider move that's triggering momentum and part of the ICC, ICJ moves, sanctions on settlers and so on, there's a chance that Israel will notice that the world exists,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick in Washington, Aislinn Laing

Palestine needs more than a gesture,\" adding \"The breaking of cultural, academic, economic relations... of our government with Israel would be a much more useful first step because we know that it does work (because it worked in South African apartheid) and that the Palestinians and the solidarity movements do ask for it.\"\n\nAna S\u00e1nchez, a speaker from another Spanish group named Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine (RESCOP) was also unimpressed by the Spanish government's declaration. In an interview with Canal Red, S\u00e1nchez added: \"we would have loved to wake up to the news that our government has cut its ties with a genocidal, apartheid and colonial regime... the recognition of a state does not imply the solution to all the decades long systemic infringements of the Palestinian people's rights.\" S\u00e1nchez also denounced the fact that Spain will continue to hold diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and even sell arms, \"to those who oppress the state which we just recognized,\" likening the declaration to a \"wet piece of paper.\"\n\n'End EU-Israel agreement'\n\nIrish and Norwegian groups also showed some doubt vis-\u00e0-vis the recent announcements made by their governments. The Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC), one of the leading pro-Palestinian organization in the Republic of Ireland, did not refer at all to the decision to recognize Palestine directly, but rather issued a tweet reading: \"The Irish government should now sanction apartheid Israel for its crimes against the Palestinian people. End all trade with Israel. Enact the Occupied Territories Bill and Divestment Bill. End US military use of Shannon. Call for an end to the EU-Israel Agreement.\"\n\nEarlier today, IPSC also referred sarcastically to the Israeli MFA decision to expel the ambassadors of the recognizing state, adding: \"Well now, we've been calling for the expulsion of the Apartheid Ambassador but we didn't think they'd do it themselves.\"\n\nIn Norway, the Palestine Committee, a group established as early as 1969, congratulated the government on the decision, adding \"This is a matter we have worked on for a long time and an important signal to Israel that Norway does not accept the occupation of the West Bank or the intention that Gaza be emptied of Palestinians in order to expand the state of Israel.\"\n\nHowever, the group also added \"Clear political signals are important, but recognition of the State of Palestine must be followed up with concrete measures that can end the Israeli occupation and contribute to the realization of an independent Palestinian state.\" These include, according to the Committee's spokesperson Line Khatib, stopping financial support for \"Israel's colonization\" through divestment from Israeli companies.\n\nFinally, regarding the premises of a two state solution, the Committee added: \"The Palestine Committee believes that, through elections, the Palestinians themselves must decide on their own future, whether a two-state solution or a state with equal rights for all between the river and the sea should form the basis for lasting peace. A just peace solution must include the right of return for all displaced Palestinian refugees.\"\n\nInterestingly, the Facebook page belonging to the Palestinian Community in Norway, did not react to the decision in any way so far.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ireland", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/598313", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The UN backed such a division of the territory in 1947, but there has been fighting ever since.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the seemingly endless Israeli-Palestinian cycle of crisis followed by political inertia, there has been little room for hope or new ways of thinking.\n\nThat may be changing due in large part to the horrible humanitarian toll of the present Gaza conflict.\n\nThe United States, which has been critical of Israel's prosecution of the war, has not shifted from its long-standing position that the fighting must end before a two-state solution can be negotiated between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\n\nIn this, Washington is in lockstep with Jerusalem.\n\nThe Americans voted against a UN Security Council resolution last month seeking to make the state of Palestine an official member of the international body -- an upgrade from its \"observer status.\"\n\nThe UN General Assembly responded by granting Palestine all the rights of a UN-member state, except for voting rights.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd it was here, after the votes had been counted, that the shifting opinions on the path toward peace between Israel and Palestine were put on display.\n\nThe U.S., along with a handful of others, still voted with Israel against the Palestinian upgrade.\n\nOther major western countries, such as France, voted in favour, saying: \"The time has come for the United Nations to take action with a view to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of the two-state solution.\"\n\nBut there was a shift in those who abstained from the vote, countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom -- otherwise staunch allies of Israel.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly echoed the position of her British counterpart, David Cameron, in saying: \"We believe that such recognition of Palestinian statehood should not come at the start of a new process, but it doesn't to be at the very end of the process.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt's a change from one of her Conservative party predecessors, ex-foreign minister John Baird, who stuck to the status quo, pro-Israeli position, when the question of Palestinian statehood was raised, more than a decade ago.\n\nSome will view Canada's abstention on the UN vote as wishy-washy, or as a cowardly refusal to take a stand at a time when the much of the world is crying out for a ceasefire, the return of captured Israelis and a permanent end to the cycle of violence.\n\nNorway, Ireland and Spain have their own political, historical and domestic reasons for recognizing the state of Palestine before the fighting between Israel and Hamas has ended. Regardless, they hope that in taking a stand, they can pressure other reticent nations to follow their lead in putting Palestinian statehood before a negotiated peace.\n\nIt may not work. It may aggravate an already-bad situation.\n\nIreland's Martin admitted: \"There is a long road ahead.\" Even then, it may not work. Backing a Palestinian state may simply aggravate Israel and inflame an already-bad situation.\n\nIf Israel and Hamas can't even agree to a temporary ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange, after all, it's hard to envision even a distant future in which the state of Palestine lives side-by-side with Israel.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn spite of that grim outlook, three states decided to take a controversial stand Wednesday. It is one taken at what Norway's St\u00f8re described as the \"lowest point in the prolonged Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\" It is one he claimed was neither pro-Palestinian nor anti-Israeli, but a gesture meant to \"reinforce moderate forces that are seeking a political solution on both sides.\"\n\nThe three nations concluded that if it is the height of foolishness to do the same thing repeatedly and expect different results, it may at least be worth a try.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allan_woods@thestar.com",

You may opt out at any time.\n\nIreland, Norway, and Spain announced on Wednesday that they will recognize the state of Palestine by May 28 in a largely symbolic move to grant the enclave international legitimacy. \"This is an investment in the only solution that can bring lasting peace in the Middle East,\" Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said on Wednesday in reference to the two-state solution.\n\nThe decision will likely have little immediate impact on people living in Gaza -- where the Israel-Hamas war has created a dire humanitarian crisis and killed more than 35,500 Palestinians -- or the West Bank. However, both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, the latter of which exercises limited self-rule over the West Bank, praised the recognition, arguing that it will give Palestinians hope for peace and security.\n\nThe move comes as Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced on Wednesday that Israel will allow its citizens to return to three former West Bank settlements after being barred from doing so. Israelis were evacuated from the areas in 2005 as part of a broader disengagement that also saw the withdrawal of all Israeli security forces and settlements in Gaza. At the time, the evacuation of the settlements in the occupied West Bank was heralded by international observers as a positive step toward creating conditions conducive to the establishment of a contiguous, sovereign Palestinian state.\n\nAround 140 members of the United Nations already recognize a Palestinian state, and earlier this month, the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to grant new \"rights and privileges\" to Palestine, including the right to speak on all issues and participate in U.N. debates.\n\nHowever, few major Western powers recognize Palestine's sovereignty. On Wednesday, the White House reiterated that U.S. President Joe Biden is a \"strong supporter\" of a two-state solution but believes that \"a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition,\" which has long been the U.S. position. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said London will not recognize a Palestinian state while Hamas remains in Gaza.\n\nIsrael rejects all moves to legitimize the enclave on an international scale. Recognizing Palestinian statehood is \"a reward for terror,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. In response to Wednesday's announcements, Israel recalled its ambassadors in Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said his office also summoned the top diplomats of those three countries for \"reprimand talks,\" during which they were shown a video of female Israeli soldiers being abducted during Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Israel will also withhold funds from the Palestinian Authority.\n\nSome experts believe that these new state recognitions could spur more European countries to consider the move. European Union members Malta and Slovenia -- alongside Spain and Ireland -- suggested in March that they were considering Palestine's recognition as \"a positive contribution\" toward ending the war.\n\nState visit. Kenyan President William Ruto traveled to Washington on Wednesday for the start of a three-day diplomatic mission. Ruto is the first African leader to be feted with a formal U.S. state visit since 2008. While at the White House, Ruto will meet with Biden to discuss ways to bolster investment, tech innovation, clean energy, and security. Kenya and the United States have long partnered on counterterrorism efforts in Africa, including against extremist group al-Shabab, and Washington seeks to further its influence on the continent as rivals China and Russia advance their reach across the global south.\n\nRuto's visit comes just days before Nairobi is set to deploy around 1,000 police officers to Haiti to try to help quell rampant gang violence in the country. The Bahamas, Barbados, Benin, Chad, and Bangladesh are expected to back Kenya's forces. Washington has refused to contribute its own troops but remains one of Kenya's strongest supporters for the multilateral effort, even when Nairobi faced domestic hurdles toward approving the deployment.\n\nEarly vote. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday called for surprise snap elections to be held on July 4, saying the economy is under control and inflation has improved. Sunak's Conservative Party, which has held power for the past 14 years, is polling around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party. Some analysts predict that Labour leader Keir Starmer will become the United Kingdom's next prime minister.\n\nA new Sunflower Movement? More than 10,000 people gathered in Taipei, Taiwan, late Tuesday to protest a controversial legislative package that some experts argue aims to weaken newly elected President Lai Ching-te's ability to govern. Under the set of bills, the China-leaning opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party is pursuing a free trade agreement with Beijing. The KMT skipped committee review to try to get the legislation passed, and it issued amendments that would allow lawmakers to summon individuals for questioning and criminally charge anyone who refuses to appear before parliament or lies in the legislature.\n\nCritics fear the amendments could be used to target political dissidents or disclose confidential information, thereby hurting Taiwan's national security. China has repeatedly denounced Lai for his past pro-independence rhetoric. Some analysts are comparing Tuesday's public demonstrations to the 2014 Sunflower Movement, a Taiwanese student-led campaign that protested the KMT's passage of a treaty with China.\n\nAfD controversy. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party announced on Wednesday that it will ban leading candidate Maximilian Krah from appearing at election events over his comments that not all Nazi SS commanders should be considered criminals. The SS (or Schutzstaffel) was the Nazi party's paramilitary branch in charge of overseeing the mass murder of Jews. Krah has also come under scrutiny in recent weeks for reportedly receiving payments from Russia and China. His aide was arrested last month for allegedly spying for Beijing.\n\nThe AfD's decision follows French far-right politician Marine Le Pen saying on Tuesday that her National Rally party will stop cooperating with the AfD in the European Parliament. \"It's time to make a clean break with this movement, which has no leadership and is clearly under the sway of radical groups within it,\" Le Pen said on Wednesday. The European Parliament is set to hold elections in early June.\n\nScience fiction aficionados aren't giving up yet on the New York City-to-Dublin video portal. The popular installation, which offers a live video feed connecting the two cities, reopened on Sunday with new sensors in place to block inappropriate behavior. The tweaks followed a series of incidents last week, in which some passersby exposed their body parts or held up inappropriate images. \"It's obviously very entertaining, even if there's nothing happening on the other side,\" one participant said.", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_sharp@foreignpolicy.com",

Squeezed by Israel, the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority in the West Bank struggles to pay its own civil servants. But it follows a steady build-up of problems, from Washington's warnings over withholding arms if the war in Gaza continues and sanctions against violent settlers to accusations of genocide before the International Court of Justice and a possible arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the International Criminal Court.\n\nNetanyahu has long resisted the so-called two-state solution and his resistance has increased since he went into government with a clutch of hard right religious nationalist parties at the end of 2022. His government remains deeply suspicious of the Palestinian Authority, set up three decades ago under the Oslo interim peace accords, accusing it of hostile actions from paying the families of armed militants killed by Israeli forces to encouraging antisemitism in schoolbooks.\n\nNetanyahu himself described the decision by the three countries as \"a reward for terrorism\", and said a Palestinian state would \"try to repeat the massacre of Oct. 7 again and again.\" That comment underlined how bitter the climate surrounding the war in Gaza has become and how distant the prospects of a political settlement based on an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel now appear, with peace talks seemingly hopelessly blocked.\n\nAs well as recalling its ambassadors from Oslo, Madrid and Dublin, the foreign ministry summoned the Norwegian, Irish and Spanish ambassadors in Israel to be shown video footage of the attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7. Laura Blumenfeld, a Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the three countries' decision was \"diplomatically bold but emotionally tone deaf and unproductive.\"\n\n\"For Israelis it will increase paranoia, reinforcing Netanyahu's argument that Israelis stand alone,\" she said. \"For Palestinians, it falsely raises expectations, without defining a pathway toward realizing legitimate national dreams.\" LONGER TERM PRICE\n\nFor Netanyahu, struggling to hold together a fractious wartime coalition and widely blamed in Israel for the disaster of Oct. 7, Wednesday's announcement may provide a temporary lift, by reinforcing an image of defiance in the face of a hostile world. \"This really strengthens the narrative which we have been hearing since Day One of this war that in the end, we can only depend on ourselves,\" said Yonatan Freeman, an international relations specialist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \"And I think that this can even assist the Israeli government's explanation and description of what it's doing in this war.\"\n\nHowever, the longer term price to Israel of standing in the way of moves towards a Palestinian state may be heavier, starting with the prized goal of normalized relations with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu's top foreign policy goal before the attack. Appearing before a Senate committee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that for an agreement to be reached with Saudi Arabia, there would have to be calm in Gaza and a \"credible pathway\" towards a Palestinian state.\n\n\"And it may well be...that, in this moment, Israel is not able or willing to proceed down that pathway,\" he added. For Israelis, the images of Oct. 7, when Hamas-led gunmen rampaged through communities around the Gaza Strip, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages into captivity, remain deeply traumatic.\n\nBut outside Israel, the images of the suffering in Gaza, where the relentless Israeli campaign launched in response has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the heavily built up enclave, have helped fuel an expanding protest movement on U.S. college campuses and the streets of European cities. For both the U.S. administration and other governments like Germany that have traditionally been friendly to Israel, the often angry protests have imposed an increasingly heavy political cost.\n\nBoth countries say recognising a Palestinian state must be the result of negotiations rather than unilateral declarations, and other major European countries like France and Britain also declined to join the trio granting recognition. But for Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's foreign ministry and a critic of Netanyahu's government, the recognition of Palestine by individual countries was less important than the broader context, including cases against Israel and its leaders at the international tribunals in the Hague.\n\n\"If it's part of a wider move that's triggering momentum and part of the ICC, ICJ moves, sanctions on settlers and so on, there's a chance that Israel will notice that the world exists,\" he said.

This is a legal commitment that countries are making,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she was hopeful the collective nature of the endeavour \"will push others now in Europe to take similar steps\".\n\nInes Abdul Razek, a Palestinian political analyst, did not share Odeh's enthusiasm, however.\n\n\"It is definitely not the great victory move it claims to be,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"The decision will trigger a diplomatic ballet of preformative frictions while not changing anything about our very concrete and accelerated erasure as a people.\"\n\nAbdul Razek, director of advocacy organisation the Palestine Institute for Public Democracy, instead called for the advancement of Palestinian rights and \"actual measures including sanctions and arms embargo\" on Israel.\n\nIn the West Bank and Jerusalem, people AFP spoke to were optimistic but wanted more tangible acts towards Palestinian sovereignty.\n\nAyed Bornat, a resident of Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital, said he welcomes the recognition, and urged other nations to follow suit \"so we can be the Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its capital\".\n\n'Weak' diplomacy\n\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry welcomed the decision.\n\n\"With this significant step, Spain, Norway and Ireland have once again demonstrated their unwavering commitment to the two-state solution and to delivering the long overdue justice to the Palestinian people,\" a statement read.\n\nIt urged all countries that have not yet recognised the state of Palestine \"to take this principled decision as soon as possible\".\n\nBut some lamented Palestinian diplomacy's conspicuous absence from the process.\n\n\"Palestinian diplomacy is weak,\" Jerusalem resident Yassin Abu Khudair told AFP.\n\n\"From the minister of foreign affairs to the youngest diplomatic employee, they did nothing.\"\n\nManuel Abdel-Aal from Ramallah echoed this.\n\n\"I see Palestinian diplomacy is absent and playing no role\" in the recognition decision, he said, adding that current circumstances alone led to the decision.\n\n\"What the Palestinians are going through these days, whether in Gaza or in the West Bank, is what spurred these European countries to take a stand,\" he added. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"body": "RAMALLAH -- Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on Wednesday warned of an escalation of tension after an Israeli minister announced plans to impose sanctions on the Palestinian Authority.\n\nMustafa made the remarks during a meeting in Ramallah with 50 members of the diplomatic corps accredited to the State of Palestine, and representatives of international organizations and institutions, according to a statement released by his office.\n\nMustafa underscored the grave consequences of the Israeli official's proposed sanctions on the Palestinian people, leadership, and institutions, saying they would lead to \"an escalation of the situation.\"\n\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take immediate action against the Palestinian Authority due to its \"unilateral steps\" against Israel, including its efforts to gain the recognition of Palestine at the United Nations, as reported by the Israeli public radio.\n\nAccording to the radio, Smotrich called for the approval for the construction of tens of thousands of settlement units in the West Bank and the establishment of a settlement for every state that \"unilaterally\" recognizes a Palestinian state.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Netanyahu, Smotrich said that he would not transfer clearance revenues (taxes collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority) to the Palestinian Authority, according to the radio.\n\nThe Israeli minister's demands followed announcements from Spain, Norway, and Ireland on Wednesday regarding their recognition of the Palestinian state, set to take effect on May 28.\n\nMustafa urged countries that have not yet recognized Palestine to expedite the process and support the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent state in accordance with international resolutions.\n\nIsrael launched a large-scale offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip to retaliate against a Hamas rampage through the southern Israeli border on Oct. 7, 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage.", "source": {"uri":

press briefing on Wednesday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan reiterated President Biden's support for a two-state solution to end the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, but that Palestinian statehood should come from \"direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\" Sullivan made the remarks after Ireland, Norway and Spain said earlier on Wednesday that they plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nBy the three nations European nations recognizing a Palestinian state is the US concerned that this is just the tip of the iceberg that we're now at a point where other nations over us objections will recognize Palestine.\n\nEach country is entitled to make its own determinations.\n\nBut the US position on this is clear, President Biden, as I just said, has been on the record supporting a two state solution.\n\nHe has been equally emphatic on the record that that two state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\n\nThat's a principled position that we have held on a consistent basis.\n\nWe'll communicate that to our partners around the world and we'll see what unfolds a quick follow up on that.\n\nUm How concerned are you about Israel's growing diplomatic isolation?\n\nAnd do you view it that way?\n\nAnd what does this also mean for, you know, any deal, any Saudi deal to recognize Israel?\n\nI mean, does this diminish the chances of that?\n\nI think it's a fair question as, as a country that stands strong in defense of Israel in international forums like the United Nations, we certainly have seen a growing chorus of voices, including voices that had previously been in support of Israel drift in another direction that is of concern to us because we do not believe that that contributes to Israel's long term security or vitality.\n\nAnd so that's something that we discussed with the Israeli government and something that we believe that uh a strategic approach to defeating Hamas, protecting civilians, surging humanitarian assistance and then pursuing that vision of regional integration, I just talked about will put Israel in the best stead uh to engage countries around the world and revitalize a lot of the partnerships and friendships that have been a source of great strength for Israel over time and can be

In addition to Spain, Norway and the Republic of Ireland will be adopting the same stance. It was the Socialist leader's second bold diplomatic move this week after pulling Madrid's Ambassador Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Alonso Jim\u00e9nez from Buenos Aires. Of the 193 United Nations member states, 143 have recognized an independent state of Palestine, including China and Russia.\n\nS\u00e1nchez's decision regarding the South American country was due to an exchange of verbal diatribes between him and members of his cabinet with Argentine President Javier Milei, a staunch supporter of Israel in its conflict with Hamas.\n\nNevertheless, the Spanish head of government insisted Wednesday that recognizing Palestine was not against anyone, let alone \"the people of Israel\" or \"against the Jews.\" S\u00e1nchez also underlined that the decision was not \"in favor of Hamas\" as opposition lawmakers from the rightwing Popular Party and Vox contended \"in a shameful attempt to take political advantage of this matter\" which was also how the Israeli government was depicting the new scenario.\n\n\"This recognition is not against anyone, it is in favor of peaceful coexistence between Israel and Palestine, it is in favor of the two-state solution, it is in favor of international law, of those who want the world not to be governed by the will of the strongest,\" S\u00e1nchez argued.\n\nHe also reckoned that it would surely not please some Israeli leaders and that there would be consequences. \"We are prepared to assume them because we think that the purpose of diplomacy is not to not bother anyone but to defend our own interests and values in a peaceful way and that is what we are doing today.\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez also maintained that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"continues to turn a deaf ear, bombing hospitals, schools, homes, and punishing more than a million people\" in Gaza \"with hunger, cold, and terror,\" for which International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has requested an arrest warrant against him as well as against Israeli Defense Minister Yuval Gallant and three top Hamas leaders.\n\nIn the Spanish Prime Minister's view, fighting the terrorist group Hamas was \"legitimate and necessary\" but Netanyahu \"is generating so much pain, so much destruction and so much rancor in Gaza and the rest of Palestine that the two-state solution is in serious danger.\"\n\n\"If one thing is clear to me, it is that Netanyahu does not have a peace project for Palestine,\" S\u00e1nchez also pointed out.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re announced that \"there can be no peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.\"\n\n\"The Palestinians have a fundamental, independent right to their own state. Both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace in separate states,\" he added.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris underlined that Hamas was \"not the Palestinian people\" and that Wednesday's decision had been taken \"to help create a peaceful future.\"\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas thanked Harris for such a \"courageous\" step and hoped other countries would issue similar statements of recognition shortly. Britain, Australia, and EU members Malta, and Slovenia have been singled out by press reports as the next likely candidates to follow suit. Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh spoke of a \"historic moment\" after decades of struggle.\n\nIn this scenario, Israel pulled its ambassadors from all three countries because they were sending a message to the world that \"terrorism pays\" and from now on Palestine would try to repeat the Oct. 7 massacre time and again. \"We will not consent to this,\" Netanyahu said. \"This evil can not be given a state,\" he added.\n\nIsrael claims that the PA already supports terror and the destruction of Israel and can not, therefore, be a partner for peace. Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that Israel would not remain silent in the face of \"those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security.\"\n\n\"This distorted step by these countries is an injustice to the memory of the victims of 7/10, a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages, and a boost to Hamas and Iran's jihadists, which undermines the chance for peace and questions Israel's right to self-defense,\" Katz also wrote on social media.", "source": {"uri": "en.mercopress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MercoPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The announcement by the three European countries to formally recognize the State of Palestine drew praise from many countries in the Arab and Muslim world.\n\nKuwait's ministry of foreign affairs praised Norway, Ireland and Spain's decision to formally recognize Palestine as an official independent state. In a press release, the ministry considered this decision a positive step in the direction of achieving justice and freedom for Palestinians, affirming Kuwait's support in pushing other countries to take similar decisions.\n\nKuwait also proposed that 10 percent of profits from the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development be dedicated to the support of Palestine, a Kuwaiti minister said on Wednesday. Speaking to KUNA on the sidelines of the Joint Annual Meetings of Arab Financial Institutions 2024 in Cairo, Kuwait's Minister of Finance and Minister of State for Economic and Investment Affairs Dr Anwar Al-Mudhaf indicated the proposal was approved by the attendees.\n\nThe Zionist entity said it was recalling its envoys to Dublin, Oslo and Madrid for \"urgent consultations\" and also summoned the three European ambassadors for a rebuke. Most Western governments, including the United States, say they are willing to one day recognize Palestinian statehood -- but not before thorny issues are settled, including on final borders and the status of Jerusalem.\n\nBut Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said that \"recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict\". \"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for (Zionists) and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security.\"\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his Zionist counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu was \"causing so much pain, destruction and resentment in Gaza and the rest of Palestine that the two-state solution is in danger\". And Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris stressed that \"a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment\". Harris drew parallels with international recognition of the Irish state in 1919. \"From our own history, we know what it means,\" he went on, referring to Ireland's declaration of independence from British rule, which eventually led to formal statehood.\n\nSweden, which has a large Palestinian community, became the first European Union member in western Europe to recognize Palestinian statehood in 2014.\n\nA Palestinian state was recognized by Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania before they joined the EU. In March, Slovenia and Malta signed a statement with Spain and Ireland expressing their willingness to recognize a Palestinian state. Slovenia's government this month passed a decree on recognizing a Palestine state that will be sent to parliament for approval by mid-June.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Authority, which rules parts of the occupied West Bank, 142 of the 193 UN member countries already recognize a Palestinian state. The Palestine Liberation Organization, seen internationally as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, hailed the European moves as \"historical\". Hamas also welcomed \"an important step towards affirming our right to our land\", while Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas political bureau member, said it would mark \"a turning point in the international position on the Palestinian issue\".\n\nA Palestinian in war-torn Gaza's southern city of Rafah, Ismail Hassuna, 46, said the European trio's decision was a step that \"will restore hope\" and should help in efforts to \"stop (the Zionist entity) from its heinous crimes\".\n\nPolitical analyst Ines Abdul Razek, who heads the Palestine Institute for Public Democracy, labeled the decision symbolic but said it was \"not a great victory\". \"What we need is actual measures, including sanctions and arms embargoes, that can stop the genocide, the erasure of our people and colonization of our land, which (the Zionist entity) has been conducting with total impunity,\" said Abdul Razek.\n\nThe Zionist entity's offensive has killed at least 35,709 people in Gaza, mostly women and children. It also imposed a siege that has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most water, food, medical supplies and fuel, and brought much of the population to the brink of famine. Fierce fighting has raged around Rafah, the last part of Gaza to face a ground invasion, where an AFP team reported more air and artillery strikes early Wednesday.\n\nHeavy battles have also rocked Gaza's northern and central areas where Hamas forces have regrouped, and more Zionist air strikes have hit Gaza City, Jabalia and Zeitun. Ten people were killed in the central town of Al-Zawaida during the night, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. And the Gaza civil defense agency said six bodies were recovered from the rubble of a family house in Jabalia.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said northern Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, were besieged by Zionist forces, with more than 200 patients trapped inside. Heavy fighting has also rocked the other major Palestinian territory, the occupied West Bank, where a Zionist raid entered its second day in the city of Jenin. Explosions and gunfire were heard from inside the Jenin refugee camp, an AFP correspondent said, after eight Palestinians were killed on Tuesday. - Agencies", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com",

Picture:\n\nIt comes 44 years after Ireland became the first European Union member to endorse the establishment of a Palestinian state, and 30 after the Oslo Accords. We had all that time in between to do it, yet we are only doing it now?\n\nThe official press release from the Department of Foreign Affairs hailed Wednesday's announcement as \"a historic moment for Ireland,\" which is quite telling in its self-praise.\n\nWhile it may well be an historic moment for Ireland, one which will be feted far and wide for as an example of a right-thinking country taking action in a world sadly devoid of reason, the announcement will have done absolutely nothing to stop the bombs falling on Gaza tonight.\n\nThe Irish Government knows this, and cannot be directly blamed for it, but what it can be blamed for is failing to appropriately sanction Israel up to this point. Would this declaration have happened regardless of the October 7 attacks?\n\nWould it have happened if protests across the country had not demanded some action -- any action - as opposed to endless self-serving rhetoric? Would it have happened if there were no local and European elections coming up? Maybe, but even as it is happening, what does it mean?\n\nThe central condition of Irish recognition of the state of Palestine is based around this mythical idea of a two state solution, which is the proposed framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establishing two states for two peoples: Israel for the Jewish people and Palestine for the Palestinian people.\n\nIn 1993, the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed on a plan to implement a two-state solution as part of the Oslo Accords, leading to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nSince Oslo, countries like Ireland bandy around the term \"two state solution\" as a totem of how much they care, like parents who tell their misbehaving children they would only love to turn the television back on, if only they could find the remote they themselves have hidden.\n\nNo greater evidence of vacuousness of the phrase is required than hearing President Joe Biden say them, which he did during his recent State of the Union address, declaring \"the only real solution is a two-state solution.\"\n\nEverybody says it. Everybody who wants to sound like they give a damn. Everybody, except the people that matter most: the Palestinian people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Harris reiterated that Ireland's statement was one of \"unequivocal support for a two-state solution -- the only credible path to peace and security for Israel, for Palestine and for their peoples.\"\n\nWere any Palestinian actors consulted on this position, I wonder? If any Government official was to attend just one of the many, many lectures and moderated discussion held in public spaces and academic halls these past six months, they'd likely have heard how sick and tired Palestinian people are of hearing the words \"two-state solution\" weaponised as a placatory totem of concern for their people, especially since Western politicians love to talk about it, but refrain from ever describing what it might realistically look like, and how it would function.\n\nAnd, as we all advocate for Palestinian self-determination, does perpetuating this nonsense not feed the very orientalism that got us all here in the first place, ignoring, as we so easily do, the will of the Palestinian people?\n\nAside from the geographical impossibility of the proposition, the issue of governance has never been adequately addressed by non-Palestinian policy makers, who seem content in assuming out loud that the much-maligned Palestinian Authority will quell the ubiquitous distrust it inspires, seen as they are as an Israeli backed proxy devoid of any real power -- or ability -- to properly lead or govern their people.\n\nIt's widely believed the Palestinian Authority has actively helped Israel to keep tight control over the Palestinian population, with many perceiving the body as a tool of the Israeli security apparatus, its US-trained forces not only targeting those suspected of planning attacks on Israelis, but also arresting union figures, journalists, and critics on social media.\n\nYet, for all of that, the mythical two state solution gets wheeled out by Western governments like our own as if it might just work. While all support for the state of Palestine should be welcomed, the repeating of such fantastical hyperbole is at best ignorant, at worst contemptuous in its opportunism.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_sheridan@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Colin Sheridan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oslo Accords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ireland", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8253/4126669_4_articlelarge_Palestine_20statement-9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1052, "textEnd": 1061}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Quoted by \"Reuters,\" he stated, \"This gesture supports the moderate factions struggling amidst this prolonged and harsh conflict.\" St\u00f8re also urged other nations to follow Norway's lead in recognizing Palestine, advocating for the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the existing authority in the West Bank.\n\nNotably, Norway played a pivotal role over three decades ago when it facilitated secret negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, resulting in mutual recognition and the commencement of peace talks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic of Ireland is poised to announce its recognition of Palestine on Wednesday, a decision that has drawn strong opposition from Israel, as reported by \"Reuters.\" European Union members Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Malta have indicated their intentions to recognize Palestine in recent weeks, possibly as part of a coordinated effort to reinforce the necessity of a two-state solution for enduring peace in the region.\n\nHowever, Spain later refuted claims of imminent recognition, with Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez asserting that any recognition of Palestine would require joint action with other nations. These developments come amid escalating violence in Gaza due to Israel's military offensive against Hamas, prompting international calls for a ceasefire and a durable peace agreement.\n\nThe Irish government defended its decision to recognize Palestine, asserting that it complements ongoing peace efforts and lends support to the two-state solution. In response, Israel's foreign ministry cautioned against such recognition, warning of potential repercussions including increased terrorism and regional instability.\n\nElsewhere, the United States recently vetoed Palestine's bid for full United Nations membership during a Security Council meeting in April.

And most European governments offered unequivocal support to the International Criminal Court this week, after it requested arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and defense minister, along with leaders of Hamas.\n\nIsrael still has staunch allies within the European Union, especially Hungary and the Czech Republic, and key players like Germany, despite growing discomfort with Israel's conduct, have not shown any inclination to alter their stance.

Europe has long supported the eventual creation of a Palestinian state -- the \"two-state solution\" that Israel's government steadfastly opposes -- and voiced frustration with Israeli handling of the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, but most nations have been unwilling to go further.\n\nInstead, the European Union, before the war, was moving closer to Israel, including through financially and politically important partnerships in trade and science.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_State_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of the State of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/22/multimedia/22mideast-crisis-europe-gqfm/22mideast-crisis-europe-gqfm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

formally recognize a Palestinian state on May 28, a milestone diplomatic decision that hopes to bring resolution to the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\"We must be on the right side of history,\" Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said amongst the announcements with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\n\nHarris, speaking at a news conference in Dublin, said he hopes the decision would \"offer hope and encouragement to the people of Palestine at one of their darkest hours.\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez addressed the Spanish Parliament, stating:\n\n\"We hope that our recognition and our reasons contribute to other western countries following this path, because the more we are, the more strength we will have to impose a ceasefire, to achieve the release of the hostages held by Hamas, to relaunch the political process that can lead to a peace agreement.\"\n\nSt\u00f8re shared similar sentiments in his announcement, citing the decision as a political solution for both Palestinians and Israelis. \"Two states, living side by side, in peace and security,\" St\u00f8re said. \"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\"\n\nDespite Israel recalling its Oslo, Dublin and Madrid ambassadors, ordering a formal reprimand and Foreign Minister Israel Katz stating the decision \"rewards\" Hamas and Iran, S\u00e1nchez maintains the recognition goes against no one and instead \"is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nOnly a few of the 27 European Union countries recognize a Palestinian state, but Ireland, Norway and Spain will join the more than 140 United Nations member states

deepens Israeli isolation", "body": "But it follows a steady build-up of problems, from Washington's warnings over withholding arms if the war in Gaza continues and sanctions against violent settlers to accusations of genocide before the International Court of Justice and a possible arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the International Criminal Court.\n\nNetanyahu has long resisted the so-called two-state solution and his resistance has increased since he went into government with a clutch of hard right religious nationalist parties at the end of 2022.\n\nHis government remains deeply suspicious of the Palestinian Authority, set up three decades ago under the Oslo interim peace accords, accusing it of hostile actions from paying the families of armed militants killed by Israeli forces to encouraging antisemitism in schoolbooks.\n\nNetanyahu himself described the decision by the three countries as \"a reward for terrorism\", and said a Palestinian state would \"try to repeat the massacre of Oct. 7 again and again.\"\n\nThat comment underlined how bitter the climate surrounding the war in Gaza has become and how distant the prospects of a political settlement based on an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel now appear, with peace talks seemingly hopelessly blocked.\n\nAs well as recalling its ambassadors from Oslo, Madrid and Dublin, the foreign ministry summoned the Norwegian, Irish and Spanish ambassadors in Israel to be shown video footage of the attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7.\n\nLaura Blumenfeld, a Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the three countries' decision was \"diplomatically bold but emotionally tone deaf and unproductive.\"\n\n\"For Israelis it will increase paranoia, reinforcing Netanyahu's argument that Israelis stand alone,\" she said. \"For Palestinians, it falsely raises expectations, without defining a pathway toward realizing legitimate national dreams.\"\n\nFor Netanyahu, struggling to hold together a fractious wartime coalition and widely blamed in Israel for the disaster of Oct. 7, Wednesday's announcement may provide a temporary lift, by reinforcing an image of defiance in the face of a hostile world.\n\n\"This really strengthens the narrative which we have been hearing since Day One of this war that in the end, we can only depend on ourselves,\" said Yonatan Freeman, an international relations specialist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \"And I think that this can even assist the Israeli government's explanation and description of what it's doing in this war.\"\n\nHowever, the longer term price to Israel of standing in the way of moves towards a Palestinian state may be heavier, starting with the prized goal of normalized relations with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu's top foreign policy goal before the attack.\n\nAppearing before a Senate committee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that for an agreement to be reached with Saudi Arabia, there would have to be calm in Gaza and a \"credible pathway\" towards a Palestinian state.\n\n\"And it may well be...that, in this moment, Israel is not able or willing to proceed down that pathway,\" he added.\n\nFor Israelis, the images of Oct. 7, when Hamas-led gunmen rampaged through communities around the Gaza Strip, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages into captivity, remain deeply traumatic.\n\nBut outside Israel, the images of the suffering in Gaza, where the relentless Israeli campaign launched in response has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the heavily built up enclave, have helped fuel an expanding protest movement on U.S. college campuses and the streets of European cities.\n\nFor both the U.S. administration and other governments like Germany that have traditionally been friendly to Israel, the often angry protests have imposed an increasingly heavy political cost.\n\nBoth countries say recognising a Palestinian state must be the result of negotiations rather than unilateral declarations, and other major European countries like France and Britain also declined to join the trio granting recognition.\n\nBut for Alon Liel, a former director general of Israel's foreign ministry and a critic of Netanyahu's government, the recognition of Palestine by individual countries was less important than the broader context, including cases against Israel and its leaders at the international tribunals in the Hague.\n\n\"If it's part of a wider move that's triggering momentum and part of the ICC, ICJ moves, sanctions on settlers and so on, there's a chance that Israel will notice that the world exists,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick in Washington, Aislinn Laing in Madrid and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nFor now, however, he is clearly not ready to take the next step as three European countries did in co-ordinated fashion, announcing they would formally recognize a \"state\" of Palestine on May 28. Norway, Ireland and Spain claimed it would give impetus to peace in the region, a position that a top U.S. official said defied \"logic.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNeither Trudeau nor Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly echoed that U.S. criticism, or directly commented on the move. But when the NDP demanded Canada follow their lead, the prime minister underscored the urgent need for \"a credible path towards lasting peace.\"\n\n\"We oppose efforts by the Netanyahu government to reject a two-state solution. At the same time Hamas, a terrorist group, currently controls areas in Gaza and has not laid down its arms or released its hostages,\" he said.\n\n\"We are prepared to recognize the state of Palestine at the right time, not necessarily as the last step along the path.\"\n\nThe U.S. took a more skeptical view, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly rejecting the notion that \"unilateral recognition\" of statehood would contribute to a sustainable ceasefire or lasting peace in the region. \"I've not seen how that logic actually plays out,\" Sullivan told reporters at a Washington briefing.\n\n\"What I can tell you is we believe the only way that you're going to achieve a two-state solution that delivers for both Israelis and Palestinians is through direct negotiations between the parties.\"\n\nIn the face of a Netanyahu government that has rejected any talk of a negotiated two-state solution before it crushes Hamas, the militant group that launched the deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Canada and other allies have struggled to calibrate their responses.\n\nThe brutal war has exacted a steep toll: more than 1,200 Israelis dead in the Oct. 7 attack and about 130 of some 240 hostages still held by Hamas, and nearly 35,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-controlled health authorities.\n\nCanada's position has evolved continually in the months since the war began.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trudeau criticized an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders as well as Netanyahu and his defence minister. The prosecution seeks to indict the Israeli leaders for allegedly directing attacks against a civilian population and using starvation as a weapon of war.\n\n\"What I will say is troubling now is the sense of an equivalency between the democratically elected leaders of Israel, and the bloodthirsty terrorists that lead up Hamas,\" Trudeau said in Philadelphia. \"I don't think that's helpful.\"\n\nYet Trudeau has also taken a harder line on Israel, restoring funding to UNRWA, an aid agency Israel condemns as employing Hamas terrorists in its ranks, and two weeks ago shifting off Canada's long-held position at the United Nations on recognition of Palestinian statehood. Although Canada abstained from a vote supported by 143 other countries to upgrade Palestine's status at the world body, Trudeau said that Canada is prepared to recognize a Palestinian state when such a move is \" most conducive to lasting peace.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut the federal Liberal caucus remains divided over how Canada should approach the recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nIn an interview with the Star, Winnipeg MP Ben Carr said he saw \"prudence\" in how Trudeau has responded.\n\n\"There does have to be, I think, a recognition of the fact that Prime Minister Netanyahu serves as an obstacle to peace in the region ... by virtue of the fact that he is not willing to support a two-state solution,\" Carr said.\n\n\"So that does force governments around the world to say, well, wait a minute, if this person is not willing to accept that this is a pathway to peace and therefore removes the idea of statehood off the table, then we have to be open to figuring out what the future looks like.\"\n\nLiberal MP Salma Zahid said she thinks the Trudeau government should act more quickly to recognize Palestinian statehood, telling reporters, \"I'm working on it.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We need to make sure that there's long lasting peace in that region and for that, the recognition of Palestinian state is really very important.\"\n\nMP Anthony Housefather, said it is \"not the time\" to recognize Palestinian statehood. \"To me, while Hamas is in power in Gaza, while there's still hostages in tunnels under Gaza, this is absolutely not the time to do that. In the future, the absolute goal is to have two states living side by side in peace and security with each other but you can't do that while a terrorist organization is in place.\"\n\nSteven Guilbeault said the question of recognizing statehood is a \"difficult\" and \"delicate\" file, and is \"the subject of a lot of discussion obviously in cabinet, but also between Canada and several of our partners so, I'd say, to be continued.\"\n\nMcPherson said there is no reason for Canada not to have recognized a state of Palestine already, calling the stance \"absurd.\"\n\n\"The idea that this will make the Israeli government less likely to co-operate ... how much less co-operative could they be?\" she said.\n\nAsked if the New Democrats believe recognition of Palestinian statehood should be contingent on the release of the Israeli hostages taken on Oct. 7, McPherson asserted those are separate issues. \"The hostages need to be returned, but these are two separate things,\" she said. \"You don't get to conflate them to say that one can't happen until the other ... I don't accept that argument.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tonda_maccharles@thestar.com", "name": "Tonda MacCharles", "type":

Now cracks are appearing in that consensus.\n\nIreland, Spain and Norway on Wednesday declared their intention to recognize Palestinian statehood, effective next Tuesday. Previously, only seven of the 27 European Union member states had made such a pronouncement.\n\nNorway is not a member of the bloc, but the Spanish and Irish announcements will bring the number of EU countries recognizing Palestinian statehood to one-third of its membership.\n\nWhile the often-fractious bloc is unlikely to act as a whole on the question, EU members Slovenia and Malta have signaled they may extend recognition as well, and concerted lobbying efforts are under way in several other member states, including Belgium.\n\n\"There's a certain momentum there,\" said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\n\nEven as major Western powers refrain from recognition, the round of announcements illustrates yet again how the devastating war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas is complicating traditional Western alliances -- both within the EU and in transatlantic ties.\n\nFor the last two years, Washington and the EU have been largely focused on presenting a united front on the war in Ukraine, and on the growing closeness of Russia and China. But Gaza has shaken up diplomatic priorities.\n\nAnalysts say Wednesday's announcements primarily point to fundamental disagreements among Western allies over whether recognizing a Palestinian state now -- usually a prelude to establishing diplomatic ties -- will spur or hinder a future state's actual establishment.\n\nThe Biden administration supports the creation of a Palestinian state, existing side-by-side with Israel, but says recognition should be the result of political negotiations -- a view backed by key European partners including Britain, France and Germany.\n\nBut the issue is a nuanced one. Britain's foreign secretary, David Cameron, ruled out recognizing a Palestinian state while Hamas remains in Gaza, but said it could occur in the context of ongoing peace negotiations.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

will be shown to the Spanish ambassador. of the terrorist group of October 7 against Israel. \"We will show them what a twisted decision their governments made,\" Katz said.\n\n\"We will show you such a horrifying video of the kidnapping of the observation soldiers to illustrate the twisted decision that your governments made. \"Israel will not go through this in silence: its step will have serious

In 2017, Hamas amended its charter to accept the existence of Israel based on borders established after the six-day war in 1967. It reportedly indicated recently a willingness to disarm if a Palestinian state were established. But the present Israeli government led by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu remains implacably opposed to a two-state solution.\n\nCould things be different under different leadership? To answer this, we need to know whether the Israeli and Palestinian people could be persuaded to accept such a plan. Here it's worth taking a look at what polling tells us.\n\nPoliticians all too often find it convenient to blame the public for their failures. This is particularly true of failed peacemaking. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) has tracked the ups and downs of support for the two-state solution from a high of 51% and 53% for Palestinians and Israeli Jews in polls taken in 2016 to a low of 33% and 34% respectively in 2022.\n\nBut pollsters in both Israel and Palestine, who do excellent work to the highest technical standards, sadly have had little or no opportunity to measure public opinion in support of a successful peace process. They measure the situation as it is - in the context of failure. Instead they need to measure what could be, how attitudes could change given proactive political leadership determined to get to peace. With such leadership the numbers change significantly.\n\nMost recently, on the Palestinian side the Institute for Social and Economic Progress asked the two-state solution question in March 2024 in the context of \"serious negotiations\" and got a 72.5% positive response. This contrasted with PCPSR results a few months earlier in December 2023 which registered support for the two-state solution at only 34% among Palestinians when framed without the context of serious negotiations. Clearly \"serious negotiations\" are the key.\n\nOn the Israeli side, a poll run for the Geneva Initiative in January 2024 got a result of 51.3% support for the two-state solution. Specifically, this was framed in the context of a \"return of the hostages agreement, to establish in the future a non-militarised Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and total normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia\". This was only two percentage points below the high point of support at 53% recorded by the PCPSR in 2016.\n\nSecurity has always been the top priority for Israelis and when that is factored in, success in negotiations can be assured. And significantly demilitarising a future Palestine is not a deal-breaker for the Palestinians, according to the Institute for Social and Economic Progress March 2024 poll.\n\nA PCPSR poll completed for the Palestine Peace Initiative also in March 2024 found that 50.4% of respondents said the two-state solution would be acceptable to Palestinians providing they also get security and an independent state free from occupation.\n\nThe solution then to the implementation of the two-state solution appears to be to combine all the elements that can make it a success.\n\nAdditionally the scale that is used is also important. In real negotiations it is important to know where the \"red lines\" are and what the people can be persuaded to accept given positive political leadership.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, where public opinion polls were used to detail every element of a peace agreement, the people were asked what was: \"essential\" (a red line), what was \"desirable\" or \"acceptable\", what was \"tolerable\" (not wanted but with political leadership could be made into a \"yes\"), and what was \"unacceptable\" under any circumstances (another red line).\n\nRead more: How Israel failed to learn from the Northern Ireland peace process\n\nWhen we used this scale to gauge support for a two-state solution in 2009, only 21% of Israelis and 24% of Palestinians considered it \"unacceptable\". This compares very favourably with equivalent results for views of power sharing in Northern Ireland in polls I conducted in January 1998 that found it was \"unacceptable\" for 52% of Protestants and 27% of Catholics. Despite this, with political leadership from the UK, Ireland, the US and EU working together, peace was made.\n\nClearly the same can be done for Israel and Palestine with the full support of the international community.\n\nJust to make sure, Mina Zemach - the pollster I work with in Israel - ran the 2009 two-state solution (TSS) question for me again in May 2024. The findings are published here for the first time. The result among Israeli respondents was 43% \"unacceptable\". It was not as good as the 2009 result - but still better than the result for Northern Ireland where peace was achieved.\n\nCritically then, the two-state solution needs to be tested along with all the positive elements of incentives and process, both international and domestic, that can be deployed to maximise the potential for getting to peace. And when we know what that magic formula is - do it. Turn fiction into fact and end this forever war.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

John Fetterman (D-PA)\n\nThe US government said it is against the \"unilateral recognition\" of a Palestinian state, which should instead be achieved through diplomatic negotiations, according to media reports. Norway, Ireland, and Spain announced on Wednesday that they will formally recognize Palestinian statehood from May 28, in support of the so-called \"two-state solution\" intended to bring peace to the Middle East.\n\nA White House National Security Council spokesperson told CNN and Reuters that US President Joe Biden is \"a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career.\" \"He (Biden) believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition,\" the spokesperson stated. Over the weekend, Biden said he supported a two-state solution in remarks at Morehouse College's commencement, calling it \"the only solution where two people live in peace, security, and dignity.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a US official told reporters that Washington is holding talks about the post-conflict, two-state phase with other Arab capitals and Israel. The two-state solution, a plan to create a Palestinian state within the territory occupied by Israel since 1967, is supported by the UN and many nations. If implemented, it would likely require the removal of Israeli settlers from the occupied territories.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly vowed to prevent Palestinian statehood. Norway, Ireland, and Spain are just the latest Western countries to recognize Palestine. Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia did so in 1988, with Sweden joining them in 2014. Russia and China support an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nQatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari confirmed that mediation efforts by Qatar, Egypt and the United States are continuing for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Al-Ansari added, \"The mediation efforts of Qatar, Egypt and the United States are continuing to exchange prisoners and detainees and to achieve peace, security and stability in the region.\" He explained that \"Qatar calls for not paying attention to media reports questioning the ongoing mediation efforts to stop the aggression against Gaza.\" He also stressed \"the need for the focus, at this sensitive time, to be on ways to end the war in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nA senior Israeli official revealed Tel Aviv's intention to return to Qatari mediation in efforts to release hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Commenting on the CNN report, a high-ranking Egyptian source expressed on Wednesday Cairo's astonishment at \" the attempts of some parties to deliberately insult the Egyptian efforts made to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\" He explained that \"some parties are playing a game of constantly accusing the mediators, accusing them of bias and blaming them for evading making the required decisions.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that Washington and Riyadh may complete preparations for their part of the agreement to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel in the coming weeks. Blinken said during a hearing in the US House of Representatives: \"We are continuing to work to try to reach this agreement (normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel). This will require some understandings and agreements between the United States and Saudi Arabia in the areas of security, nuclear energy and defense cooperation. These agreements, in terms of \"The principle is very close to being concluded now, but it may be several more weeks before it is completed.\"\n\nHe pointed out that Saudi Arabia \"clearly demonstrated\" that if the part of the deal with the United States is completed, and in order to continue the process of normalizing relations with Israel, \"they need calm in the Gaza Strip and a reliable path towards establishing a Palestinian state.\" Blinken added that the United States \"wants to see this and that\" and continues to work to achieve this. But he found it difficult to answer the question about \"whether the Israeli government is ready to act now on this basis.\"\n\nThe Israeli Broadcasting Corporation announced yesterday that US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is \"disappointed \" after a series of meetings with senior Israeli officials, including the Prime Minister, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, Minister Benny Gantz, Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy and other officials. He put on the table for discussion a number of issues, including Rafah, the prisoner exchange deal, and normalization with Saudi Arabia.\n\nFollowing the alert in the Ajar area a short time ago, this is a false alert. Further to the alerts that were activated in the areas of Dafna and Mayan Baruch in the north of the country, these are false alerts.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday), starting in the morning until noon, a military exercise will take place in cooperation with the security forces in the area of the city of Eilat and the Eilot Regional Council. During the exercise, a lively movement of vehicles and many security forces will be felt in the area. The exercise was planned in advance as part of the IDF's annual training plan for 2024, and as part of the IDF and security forces' readiness in the city for the various threats in all sectors.\n\nThe Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Hertzi Halevi, visited today (Wednesday), the exercise of the reserve brigade \"Hafti Hash\" (551) for readiness for the North, with the participation of the commander of the Northern Command, Major General Uri Gordin, the commander of the land arm, Major General Tamir Yedai, the commander of the National Center For training on land, Brigadier General Kobi Heller, commander of the 551st Brigade, Col. Ido Kess and other commanders.\n\n\"Fighting in Gaza, or in Lebanon, requires tenacity,\" stated the Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, \"there are no easy achievements. And we need to be much more tenacious than the other side, much more tenacious. And we are looking forward, and you will see, the way to bring the residents back At the northern border with security, she also goes through a lot of talent and proper planning and a lot of stubbornness.\"\n\n\"Look at the brigade with a lot of work, a lot of experience, a lot of achievements along with a price, which we are well aware of,\" he continued, \"but I tell you, we are determined, persistent, also ready for challenges in the north, also in action in the south, also in fighting Terrorism in IOSH. And with that we are moving forward, very much trusting the people, very much trusting the reservists that this strong presence gives a lot of confidence both in readiness and professionalism. Train, lift up, we will move forward.\"\n\nPolitico reported that US intelligence, in its latest assessments, said that Israel was only able to eliminate about 30%-35% of Hamas fighters from October 7, 2023. The US intelligence assessment revealed that 65% of Hamas' tunnels are still active, indicating that Hamas has been able to recruit thousands of new fighters. The newspaper indicated that the Biden administration has become increasingly concerned about Hamas's ability to recruit thousands during the past few months during wartime, and this has allowed them to withstand Israeli attacks for months.\n\nThe newspaper explained that it is possible that these and other intelligence assessments contributed to the startling recent comments made by senior administration officials. Politico newspaper said that the administration of US President Joe Biden has become publicly critical of the Israeli military strategy in Gaza after it had been secret for a long time. Politico stated that this level of criticism of the Middle East ally has not been seen since the war began in October 2023, noting that Washington, over the course of months, quietly pushed Israel to change the way it wages its war on Gaza, but the frustration resulting from watching Israel refuse to change its course has spread increasingly. To the public and widen the gap between Washington and Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Biden administration fears that Israel may disastrously squander its chance to achieve victory over Hamas and lose its best chance to eliminate the movement's control of the Strip. Senior officials publicly describe Israel's strategy in Gaza as self-defeating and likely to open the door to the return of Hamas. The newspaper pointed out in the context that the result is that Hamas is still clinging to the land and retains great capabilities, even after the comprehensive war launched by Israel over a period of nearly eight months.\n\nOfficials said the Israeli government failed to control parts of Gaza after it was cleared, turned the civilian population and the rest of the world against it through widespread bombing and inadequate humanitarian aid, and enabled Hamas to recruit more fighters. An official told the newspaper that National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan used his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel last week to discuss how the military operation could lead to achievable and lasting success against Hamas.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday with CNN, Netanyahu said: \"We have to get rid of Hamas or there will be no future for Gaza,\" but US intelligence, in its assessment, raises growing concerns that such an outcome is not possible. Western officials believe that while Israel has weakened Hamas' capabilities in Gaza, Hamas has been able to protect thousands of its fighters, many of whom operate and hide within a sprawling tunnel network and others believed to mingle with the civilian population.\n\nRecent satellite images showed the massive destruction left by the recent Israeli attacks on the city of Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip. Although Israel describes the ground incursion as \"limited,\" it is \"practically a deep ground operation,\" according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , which described the destruction in the southern Gaza Strip as \"similar to the destruction seen in other cities throughout the Gaza Strip.\" Gaza during the early stages of the war. The latest satellite images were taken on May 19 by the private satellite company Planet Labs, and show that the Israeli army has flattened several buildings between the Kerem Shalom border crossing and the Rafah crossing.\n\nThis type of satellite imagery is considered extremely important for monitoring the progress of the war, as the army imposes severe restrictions on the entry of journalists into Gaza. The Israeli army's ground incursion into Rafah began on May 6, when the army ordered residents in parts of the area to quickly evacuate. Israeli forces entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and moved north along the Philadelphia axis, parallel to the Egyptian border.\n\nThe brigade combat teams of the 162nd division, joined by the Nahal TKS, continued their offensive activity in Rafah tonight. The forces are now acting precisely following information about terrorist targets in the area of the 'Brazil' neighborhood and the 'Shabura' area while preventing as much as possible harm to the civilian population, after the citizens have evacuated the area. The activity began with a preliminary attack flight of fighter jets of the Air Force against Hamas terrorist targets in Rafah.\n\nIn the last day, the forces of the 98th Division operating in the Jabalia area in the north of the Gaza Strip have eliminated many terrorists in face-to-face battles and by directing attacks by Air Force aircraft and fighter jets. In one of the attacks, the fighters of the paratrooper brigade directed an aircraft that eliminated eight terrorists from the terrorist organization Hamas who were staying in a weapons warehouse.\n\nThe terrorists who were eliminated were operating in the fields of rockets, operating drones and observing Israeli forces. Soldiers of the 679th Israel Defense Forces have killed a number of terrorists in the center of the Gaza Strip in clashes and tank fire in the last day. Earlier today, IDF forces identified terrorists entering a military building in the Mis al-Jabal area, shortly after the identification, fighter jets attacked the building where the terrorists were staying.\n\nSoldiers of the TSK 401 are operating in the Rafah area against terrorist targets, along with advancing on the Philadelphia Axis with the help of which they managed the fighting in the last few days. The fighters of the brigade located and destroyed launch sites that were loaded and ready to fire towards Israeli territory with several canisters. The launch sites are located in East Rafah on the Philadelphia axis near the border. All the launchers were destroyed.\n\nThe fighters of the 7th Brigade Combat Team are fighting in a lumbering manner in the Jabaliya area. So far, the forces have destroyed dozens of terrorist infrastructures, attacked about 100 targets from the air and fired about 500 artillery shells. The forces raided dozens of Hamas combat compounds. As part of the effort to destroy the military's capabilities, the forces located and destroyed a number of ready-to-use launchers and dozens of rockets. In addition, during the searches, the forces located weapons, including explosive belts, ready-to-use charges, grenades, weapons and ammunition.\n\nLed by the Gaza Division and under the intelligence guidance of the Amman and the Shin Bet, fighter jets attacked a compound inside a UNRA school where Hamas terrorists were operating, including an anti-tank operative and a Nakhaba terrorist. In the compound that was attacked there were weapons including mortars, weapons and explosives. The attack was carefully planned and carried out using precise weaponry and avoiding harm to those not involved as much as possible. At the end of the destruction of the compound, many secondary explosions were detected which testified to the presence of weapons in the area.\n\nLed by the Gaza Division, Amman and the Shin Bet, an Air Force aircraft attacked and killed in Khan Yunis the terrorist Ahmed Yasser al-Kara, a key anti-tank operative in the terrorist organization Hamas who led attacks and terrorist plots against IDF forces during the war and was monitored by Southern Division. Al-Kara took part in the terrorist attack in the Gaza Envelope on October 7 and during the fighting he made many shooting attempts at our forces in the Gaza Strip. During the preparation for the attack, Unit 414 identified a child near the terrorist, so they stopped the attack immediately after the identification. After the boy moved away from the building, the attack was carried out in which two more terrorists were killed: Zahib Ra'ad Abu Riva, a Nakhaba terrorist in the Hamas terrorist organization, and Anas Muhammad Abu Hasliha, a terrorist in the GAP terrorist organization.\n\nIn addition, Air Force fighter jets, under the direction of the Southern Command and the Intelligence Wing, killed five Hamas terrorists who were operating out of the 'Fahmi Aljarjaoui' school compound in the Derg Tafah area in the northern Gaza Strip. Among the terrorists who were killed in the attack, the terrorist Fadi Salim, head of the information system in the organization's Gaza division. Along with him, three terrorists in the organization's intelligence system and another Nakhaba terrorist were killed. This is another example of the cynical and clear use that the terrorist organization Hamas makes of civilian spaces and facilities while using the Gaza population as a human shield.\n\nAir Force fighter jets attacked military buildings of the terrorist organization Hezbollah in the Eyta al-Sha'ab area, alongside observation posts of the organization in the Alma al-Sha'ab area in southern Lebanon. IDF fighters, Shin Bet, MGB fighters and undercovers continue the operation in Jenin to thwart the terrorist infrastructures located in the area. As part of the operation, the forces exchanged fire with armed men and killed a number of terrorists, including two terrorists who threw explosives at the forces. In addition, the fighters confiscated military equipment and uncovered charges that were planted under the axles and were intended to harm the troops. Yesterday (Tuesday), a gunman was identified in Jenin who entered the government hospital area and barricaded himself in it. This is another example of the cynical use by armed men in the Jenin area of humanitarian infrastructure including hospitals as shelters and hiding places.\n\nFighter jets attacked two Hezbollah launchers in the areas of Marvin and Aita al-Sha'ab in southern Lebanon. In addition, warplanes attacked a terrorist infrastructure of Hezbollah in the Rav al-Taltin area. Also, an explosive UAV that crossed Lebanese territory fell this evening in the area of Beit Hillel, there were no casualties and no damage was caused.\n\nAl-Masirah TV, affiliated with the Houthi Ansar Allah movement, reported on Wednesday that Hodeidah International Airport in western Yemen was targeted by a series of air strikes by American-British aircraft. According to the channel, American and British aircraft launched 6 raids on Hodeidah Airport, without giving further details about the material or human damage.\n\nIt should be noted that this is not the first time that Hodeidah International Airport has been targeted. Since the beginning of this month, American and British aircraft have launched a series of raids targeting the airport. On May 2, they carried out about 5 raids on Hodeidah Airport, and on the 13th of this month, they launched an air strike on the airport. On the 14th, it launched 4 raids targeting the airport and its public facilities south of Hodeidah.\n\nHodeidah overlooks the Red Sea, and it is one of the most important governorates in Yemen, as it contains an international airport, in addition to having a long coastal strip. Since last November, the Houthis in Yemen have been carrying out attacks in the Red Sea on Israeli ships or those heading to Israel, \"in support and victory for the Palestinian people and Gaza.\"\n\nBloomberg reported that the Pentagon confirmed that the Houthis are using weapons that can reach the Mediterranean. The US government is concerned that the Houthis have the ability to expand strikes on shipping beyond the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden into the Mediterranean, said an official who requested anonymity to discuss the private talks. He added that the Ansar Allah group in Yemen has advanced weapons and that their deployment of anti-ship ballistic missiles is almost unprecedented, in addition to their use of drones in their attacks. This assessment came as defense officials from the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The United States seeks to use this group to achieve greater integration in air and missile defenses, including the exchange of radar data and the development of early warning capabilities.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that the Houthis in Yemen warned early this month that they would expand their ongoing campaign of attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea to include ships in the Mediterranean . The Houthis have launched more than 90 attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 2023, and also struck at least one commercial ship linked to Israel in the Indian Ocean about 300 miles east of the African coast in late April.\n\nNorway, Ireland and Spain announced plans to join the growing bloc of European countries which recognize Palestinian statehood. Israel recalled its ambassadors to Norway, Ireland and Spain on Wednesday for \"urgent consultations,\" summoning envoys in Tel Aviv and threatening the countries with \"severe consequences\" after the trio announced plans to formally recognize Palestine - likely based on its pre-1967 borders, starting next week.\n\n\"Israel will not remain silent in the face of those undermining its sovereignty and endangering its security,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement after the recognition announcement. \"Today's decision sends a message to Palestinians and the world: Terrorism pays,\" Katz alleged, accusing the three countries of \"choosing to reward Hamas\" with statehood after its surprise incursion into southern Israel last October.\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the trio's move, saying it will help enshrine \"the Palestinian people's right to self-determination\" and bring a two-state solution closer to reality. Hamas - which doesn't recognize Israel's right to exist - also welcomed the development, calling it \"an important step on a path to establishing our right to our land,\" and urging more countries to follow suit.\n\nA White House National Security Council spokesperson rushed to Israel's defense, emphasizing that while President Biden \"is a strong supporter of a two-state solution and has been throughout his career,\" he believes a Palestinian state \"should be recognized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\" The \"direct negotiations\" the spokesman mentioned refer to an effort by Washington to broker a Palestinian-Israeli settlement - with talks failing spectacularly over the course of more than three decades thanks largely to Israeli intransigence, US favoritism for Tel Aviv and efforts by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, to divide the Palestinian liberation movement.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne criticized the three countries' move, saying that recognition was \"not just a symbolic issue or a question of political positioning, but a diplomatic tool in the service of the solution of two states living side by side in peace and security.\" Sejourne suggested conditions are not ripe to recognize Palestinian statehood. A spokesperson for Germany's Foreign Ministry echoed Washington and Paris's sentiments, saying Berlin would realize its \"firm goal\" of recognizing an independent Palestine only through a \"dialogue process.\"\n\nSweden became the first Western European country to recognize an independent Palestinian state, doing so in 2014, 26 years after five former Eastern Bloc countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Romania did so in 1988, together with Cyprus. A total of 143 of 193 members of the United Nations, including Russia, every country in the Middle East and South America, most of Africa and Asia now recognize Palestinian statehood, with Wednesday's announcement shrinking the bloc of Western countries which have not done so.\n\nNorway, Ireland and Spain represent a unique group of countries in terms of socio-economic development and political persuasion. Norway, for example, is not a member of the European Union, and while it was one of the first countries to recognize Israel in 1949 and boasts a \"long history of friendship\" with the Jewish State, it has also been highly critical of Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, and of the brutality of Tel Aviv's military operations in Gaza after October 7.\n\nSpain and Israel only established relations in the mid-1980s, and while ties quickly warmed after that, they worsened dramatically last October, when several Spanish officials recommended that Prime Minister Netanyahu be brought before the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges. This prompted Tel Aviv to accuse the Spanish government of sympathies with terrorists. Spain, interestingly, is only of the few NATO allies which has not recognized the US-sponsored puppet regime in Kosovo, Serbia, indicating at least some readiness to act against Washington's interests when Madrid sees fit.\n\nIreland has also had a rocky relationship with Israel, with embassies between the two countries set up only in 1996, and Dublin regularly criticizing Tel Aviv over its threat to Irish peacekeepers serving in the UN-led peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, over the construction of the West Bank security wall, and over illegal Mossad operations on Irish soil.\n\n\"Of course recognizing Palestinian state is a big step - it is significant,\" Dr. Mehmet Rakipoglu, an assistant professor at the Mardin Artuklu University in Turkiye, told Sputnik. Rakipoglu believes the three countries have been outside the US and Israeli orbit politically for some time, with some, like Ireland, sharing a special sympathy for the Palestinians based on their own experience of suffering at the hands of British imperialism. \"So, of course, this is a big failure of US diplomacy,\" the observer stressed.\n\n\"This is a normal failure of Israeli diplomacy, not [only] in these countries, but also at international level,\" Ayman Yousef, professor of political science and international relations at the Arab-American University in Palestine, told Sputnik. \"It will have very good implications for other countries within the EU to recognize Palestine. We see drastic changes within the foreign policy priorities of these countries. We expect countries such as Belgium, Malta, Slovenia and even Greece and Portugal to recognize Palestine as well,\" Yousef said.\n\nWednesday's move \"means, implicitly and explicitly, an alliance of these countries within the EU to shape its policies vis-a-vis Palestine, and it will push other countries to have the same diplomatic move here,\" the observer believes. For Palestine, the trio's decision will also mean improving bilateral economic, political and cultural relations, and put pressure on the US, \"the traditional ally of Israel, to be more balanced in its policies and reactions to the conflict in the Middle East,\" Yousef said.\n\nIsrael has only itself to blame for world opinion shifting against it, even among its traditional friends in the West, the observer stressed, pointing to the brutality of Israeli operations in Gaza, which have now killed or maimed more than five percent of the Strip's prewar population. \"Israel destroyed nearly everything: hospitals, mosques, churches and universities, schools and all civilian foundations of Gaza. I think the level and magnitude of this destruction have pushed these countries to change their policies in the right direction. And I think many EU countries start thinking that the stability and security in the Middle East will not be achieved, it will be a remote option if they don't recognize Palestine as an independent and sovereign country,\" Yousef said.\n\n\"Israel is failing not only within the EU, even in the United Nations to convince other countries. Even in the US, there is a huge opposition to policies adopted by the Israelis - the student demonstrations in many American universities being just one example of that,\" the observer summed up.\n\nThe Egyptan Information Service denied CNN's allegations and warns of its complete withdrawal from mediation efforts between Hamas and Tel Aviv. The Egyptian Information Service denied the allegations that came in an article published by the American CNN channel entitled \"Egypt changes the terms of the ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip.\" The head of the State Information Service, Diaa Rashwan, stated that the article published by the American website is in fact pure allegations, devoid of any information or facts, and is not based on any reliable journalistic sources in accordance with internationally accepted journalistic professional rules.\n\nDiaa Rashwan challenged CNN to attribute the allegations it published to specific official American or Israeli sources, and asked him and all international media outlets to be accurate in what they publish about such highly sensitive issues and not to base the publication of some allegations on anonymous sources that he calls \"informed sources.\" Rashwan announced that Egypt categorically rejects these allegations, noting that the State Information Service sent an official letter to CNN explaining this rejection and the grounds on which it was based, and demanded that the Egyptian response be published immediately.\n\nDiaa Rashwan added that the site had responded and published parts of this response, which included some of the observations contained therein and in this statement. The head of the State Information Service explained that such a false article, full of untruthful allegations, does not lead to, and perhaps aims to, distort Egypt's main and prominent role in the ceasefire attempts and negotiations in the Gaza Strip since the start of the bloody Israeli aggression against it about eight months ago.\n\nHe expressed Egypt's astonishment at the attempts of some parties to insult the enormous efforts it has made and is still making over the past months in an attempt to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to prevent the killing and wounding of hundreds of innocent civilians daily and the systematic destruction of all aspects of life in the Gaza Strip.\n\nRashwan stated that Egypt has noticed during recent periods that certain parties have been playing a game of constantly accusing the Qatari mediators at times and then the Egyptian mediators at other times, accusing them of siding with one of the parties and blaming them for procrastinating and evading decisive decisions regarding the ceasefire deal and the liberation of Israeli detainees in the Gaza Strip in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. This is to preserve the personal political interests of some of these parties and their attempts to confront the major internal political crises they are experiencing.\n\nHe stated that Egypt's exercise of the mediation role in the ceasefire deal and the liberation of detainees in the Gaza Strip and prisoners in Israel was based on repeated demands and insistence from Israel and the United States to play this role, which came as a result of their awareness of the extent of Egyptian experience and professionalism in managing such negotiations, especially since Egypt has previous successful experiences. Multiple conflicts between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRashwan stated that the false publication and lies being promoted about the Egyptian role cannot be interpreted as an attempt to punish Egypt for its firm, principled positions towards the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in light of its mediation role and Egypt's declared adherence to the necessity of the presence of Palestinian elements on the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing. To agree to Egypt operating it on its part and not to recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian side of the crossing, in addition to Egypt's position consistent with international law and international humanitarian law by joining the State of South Africa in the lawsuit filed before the International Court of Justice against the practices of the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe head of the State Information Service stressed that continuing attempts to cast doubt on and insult the Egyptian mediation efforts and roles with allegations that contradict reality will only lead to further complicating the situation in Gaza and the entire region and may push the Egyptian side to take a decision to completely withdraw from the mediation it is carrying out in the current conflict.\n\nRashwan held the concerned parties, especially those who spread lies about the Egyptian position, fully responsible for the unprecedented humanitarian disasters and the war of extermination in the Gaza Strip, the killing and wounding of thousands of innocent Palestinians, their displacement and starvation, and the destruction of everything in the Strip, in addition to the loss of the lives of Israeli detainees as a result of the aggressive Israeli military operation on the Strip.\n\nThe divine promise of Palestine's liberation \"from the river to the sea\" will be fulfilled, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said. Following the martyrdom-like demise of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage, Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, and his accompanying delegation met with Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei in Tehran on Wednesday to convey their condolences to the Leader and the Iranian government and nation.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Leader thanked the Palestinian nation, especially the people of Gaza, for offering their condolences. He also extended congratulations and condolences for the martyrdom of Mr. Haniyeh's children, and commended the head of the political bureau of Hamas for his patience, Khamenei.ir reported. Referring to the remarkable resistance displayed by the people of Gaza, which has surprised the world, Ayatollah Khamenei remarked, \"Who would have believed that one day, slogans in support of Palestine would be raised in US universities and that the flag of Palestine would be raised there? Who would have believed that one day in Japan and in demonstrations in support of Palestine, the slogan 'Death to Israel' would be chanted in Persian?\"\n\nHe highlighted that there may be future events related to Palestine that may seem unimaginable at present. The Leader then referenced Quranic verses regarding the realization of God's two promises to the mother of Prophet Moses (PBUH). \"Now God's first promise about the Palestinian people has been fulfilled, and that is the victory of the people of Gaza, who are a small group, against the big, powerful group [consisting of] the US, NATO, England and a number of other countries. Accordingly, the second promise, which is the elimination of the Zionist regime, can also be realized. With God's grace, the day will come when Palestine will be established 'from the river to the sea.'\"\n\n\"Mr. Mokhber, who, as stipulated in the Constitution, is in charge of the country's executive affairs, will uphold the late President's policies and beliefs regarding Palestine with the same drive and spirit,\" Ayatollah Khamenei stated. Ayatollah Khamenei has declared five days of public mourning, appointing the first vice president as the manager of the executive power.\n\nNot every number is reported every day, so sudden jumps generally reflect reporting artifacts rather than actual upticks. Many of these numbers fluctate, up and down, with no apparent explanation. This list records the highest number reliably reported for each matter, under the theory that reality with catch up with reports, as is relentlessly the case.\n\nSome reports claimed that the UN cut in half its earlier estimates of women and children killed in Gaza. Initially, they reported 9,500 women and 14,500 children killed, but later revised it to 4,959 women and 7,797 children on 08 May 2024. The UN acknowledged its inability to independently verify casualty figures. The seeming discrepancy is that HAMAS had about 10K KIA bodies on hand for which they do not have positive ID. It is possible to report the gender and approximate age [ie, juvenile] without knowing the name of the deceased.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Almost all of the Global South recognizes Palestine, while just a relative handful of so-called developed nations do -- including Sweden, Iceland, and most of Eastern Europe. The United States has actively discouraged countries from recognizing Palestinian statehood and United Nations membership.\n\n\"Hamas feeds off of Palestinian hopelessness. Israel's denial of Palestinian rights has functioned as a Hamas recruitment program.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded to Wednesday's announcement by threatening \"severe consequences\" for the three countries. Katz -- a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud party -- called recognition of Palestine \"an injustice to the memory of the victims of October 7, a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages, and a boost to Hamas and Iran's jihadists.\"\n\nThe claim that recognition is a \"reward\" or \"gift\" to Hamas -- whose fighters led the attack on Israel that left more than 1,100 people dead and over 240 others in captivity -- reverberated from social media to the halls of the U.S. Congress in the wake of the three countries' announcement. However, some experts weighed in on the policies and practices that they believe are driving young Palestinians to embrace violent resistance.\n\n\"Those claiming this 'rewards Hamas' have it exactly backward,\" said Matt Duss, executive vice president of the Center for International Policy and former chief foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.). \"Hamas feeds off of Palestinian hopelessness. Israel's denial of Palestinian rights has functioned as a Hamas recruitment program. Diplomatic recognition offers a credible alternative nonviolent path to liberation.\"\n\nU.S. political commentator Krystal Ball said on social media that \"those saying Palestinian statehood is a 'gift to Hamas,' please take note that what has actually bolstered Hamas is Israel's genocidal slaughter which has allowed Hamas to recruit thousands of new members.\"\n\nIsrael also actively propped up Hamas for years, viewing it as a means of countering and weakening the largely toothless Palestinian National Authority and its leader, President Mahmoud Abbas. The New York Timesreported in December that Israeli security forces helped Qatari officials deliver suitcases stuffed full of millions of dollars in cash to Hamas,which has governed Gaza for nearly two decades and is considered a terrorist group by Israel and the U.S.\n\nAccording to the Times, Israel allowed billions of dollars to flow from the Qatari government into Hamas' coffers, to be spent on government salaries, infrastructure, and humanitarian endeavors. This allowed Hamas to divert funds previously budgeted for those purposes into armed resistance. The payments continued as late as 2021.\n\nIsraeli leaders and their U.S. backers similarly claimed that any cease-fire in Gaza would be a \"gift to Hamas\" that would allow it to regroup and rearm. As the human toll of Israel's assault -- more than 126,000 Palestinians killed, maimed, or missing; nearly 2 million forcibly displaced Gazans; widespread starvation; and lifelong trauma -- mount, so too do motivations for Palestinians to join Hamas and other militant groups.\n\n\"Killing terrorists too often breeds more terrorism. This is an inescapable lesson of both America's decadeslong 'War on Terror' and Israel's ceaseless struggle against Hamas, Hezbollah, and other violent insurgencies,\" Matthew Levinger, a professor of international relations at George Washington University, wrote earlier this year for Just Security.\n\nSo does killing civilians. As U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has acknowledged: \"In this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"},

In 2017, Hamas amended its charter to accept the existence of Israel based on borders established after the six-day war in 1967. It reportedly indicated recently a willingness to disarm if a Palestinian state were established. But the present Israeli government led by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu remains implacably opposed to a two-state solution.\n\nCould things be different under different leadership? To answer this, we need to know whether the Israeli and Palestinian people could be persuaded to accept such a plan. Here it's worth taking a look at what polling tells us.\n\nPoliticians all too often find it convenient to blame the public for their failures. This is particularly true of failed peacemaking. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) has tracked the ups and downs of support for the two-state solution from a high of 51% and 53% for Palestinians and Israeli Jews in polls taken in 2016 to a low of 33% and 34% respectively in 2022.\n\nBut pollsters in both Israel and Palestine, who do excellent work to the highest technical standards, sadly have had little or no opportunity to measure public opinion in support of a successful peace process. They measure the situation as it is - in the context of failure. Instead they need to measure what could be, how attitudes could change given proactive political leadership determined to get to peace. With such leadership the numbers change significantly.\n\nMost recently, on the Palestinian side the Institute for Social and Economic Progress asked the two-state solution question in March 2024 in the context of \"serious negotiations\" and got a 72.5% positive response. This contrasted with PCPSR results a few months earlier in December 2023 which registered support for the two-state solution at only 34% among Palestinians when framed without the context of serious negotiations. Clearly \"serious negotiations\" are the key.\n\nOn the Israeli side, a poll run for the Geneva Initiative in January 2024 got a result of 51.3% support for the two-state solution. Specifically, this was framed in the context of a \"return of the hostages agreement, to establish in the future a non-militarised Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and total normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia\". This was only two percentage points below the high point of support at 53% recorded by the PCPSR in 2016.\n\nSecurity has always been the top priority for Israelis and when that is factored in, success in negotiations can be assured. And significantly demilitarising a future Palestine is not a deal-breaker for the Palestinians, according to the Institute for Social and Economic Progress March 2024 poll.\n\nA PCPSR poll completed for the Palestine Peace Initiative also in March 2024 found that 50.4% of respondents said the two-state solution would be acceptable to Palestinians providing they also get security and an independent state free from occupation.\n\nThe solution then to the implementation of the two-state solution appears to be to combine all the elements that can make it a success.\n\nAdditionally the scale that is used is also important. In real negotiations it is important to know where the \"red lines\" are and what the people can be persuaded to accept given positive political leadership.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, where public opinion polls were used to detail every element of a peace agreement, the people were asked what was: \"essential\" (a red line), what was \"desirable\" or \"acceptable\", what was \"tolerable\" (not wanted but with political leadership could be made into a \"yes\"), and what was \"unacceptable\" under any circumstances (another red line).\n\nRead more: How Israel failed to learn from the Northern Ireland peace process\n\nWhen we used this scale to gauge support for a two-state solution in 2009, only 21% of Israelis and 24% of Palestinians considered it \"unacceptable\". This compares very favourably with equivalent results for views of power sharing in Northern Ireland in polls I conducted in January 1998 that found it was \"unacceptable\" for 52% of Protestants and 27% of Catholics. Despite this, with political leadership from the UK, Ireland, the US and EU working together, peace was made.\n\nClearly the same can be done for Israel and Palestine with the full support of the international community.\n\nPositive polling\n\nJust to make sure, Mina Zemach - the pollster I work with in Israel - ran the 2009 two-state solution (TSS) question for me again in May 2024. The findings are published here for the first time. The result among Israeli respondents was 43% \"unacceptable\". It was not as good as the 2009 result - but still better than the result for Northern Ireland where peace was achieved.\n\nCritically then, the two-state solution needs to be tested along with all the positive elements of incentives and process, both international and domestic, that can be deployed to maximise the potential for getting to peace. And when we know what that magic formula is - do it. Turn fiction into fact and end this forever war.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\n\nHarris, speaking at a news conference in Dublin, said he hopes the decision would \"offer hope and encouragement to the people of Palestine at one of their darkest hours.\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez addressed the Spanish Parliament, stating:\n\n\"We hope that our recognition and our reasons contribute to other western countries following this path, because the more we are, the more strength we will have to impose a ceasefire, to achieve the release of the hostages held by Hamas, to relaunch the political process that can lead to a peace agreement.\"\n\nSt\u00f8re shared similar sentiments in his announcement, citing the decision as a political solution for both Palestinians and Israelis. \"Two states, living side by side, in peace and security,\" St\u00f8re said. \"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\"\n\nDespite Israel recalling its Oslo, Dublin and Madrid ambassadors, ordering a formal reprimand and Foreign Minister Israel Katz stating the decision \"rewards\" Hamas and Iran, S\u00e1nchez maintains the recognition goes against no one and instead \"is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency.\"\n\nOnly a few of the 27 European Union countries recognize a Palestinian state, but Ireland, Norway and Spain will join the more than 140 United Nations member states in this process.\n\nYou can also make a donation to our PayPal or subscribe to our

Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nThe Biden administration has been working on this for a long time, he added.\n\nIn response to a question, Sullivan said that he could not see how the unilateral recognition of Palestine would contribute to any real progress toward a peace process or ceasefire.\n\nEvery country has the right to make its own decisions, but the US position on this matter is clear: a two-state solution must be brought about through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\n\nUS President Biden has repeatedly said this on the record.\n\nNorway and the two EU countries Ireland and Spain had earlier on Wednesday announced that they would recognise Palestine as a separate state.\n\nThe step is to be made formal on May 28, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe three countries hope

They got billions [from various countries, and] in US taxpayer money in aid paid to UNRWA, and through other NGOs,\" he continued. \"What did they do with all these funds?

No, they used it for rockets, for weapons, for tunnels, and for terror operatives.\"\n\n\"That's what happens when you give them a state,\" he added.\n\nHe then blasted the notion that the solution to Israel's conflict with the Palestinians is to \"repeat the same exact thing that has been done,\" calling such a strategy \"just plain stupidity,\" while noting that that is exactly what the Biden administration has \"pressured Israel to do over and over and over again.\"\n\n\"We know that the vast majority of the public in the United States support Israel over Hamas,\" he stated, expressing hope that the majority's views will be heeded by the State Department.\n\nHe also explained why it is critical that Israel fully defeat Hamas in Gaza and not allow it to retain any power post-war.\n\n\"We have to understand that Hamas is a terror cartel that exports terror all around the world,\" he said, warning that it could potentially be found in a \"mosque near you\" in the United States, and worldwide.\n\n\"The Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas -- it's all part of the same conglomerate of terror,\" he elaborated.\n\nAccording to Rothman, if allowed to survive, Hamas, along with its ideology and tactics, would flourish and spread because \"if you have a successful franchise, you expand it.\"\n\nIf Hamas would [prove to] be a successful franchise; having attacked and killed Israelis, invaded Israel and survived to see the next day, survived and became stronger, survived and got a huge reward from the United States -- like a Palestinian state; if that would be the case, then the franchise and the terror cartel will expand; and this terror, terrorist ideology and jihadist idea to take over the world -- you will find it imported [through] your border from Mexico to Texas or any other state in the US.\n\n\"That's why Israel defeating Hamas is essential, not only for the security of Israel, which is of course essential, but also for the security of the world,\" he concluded.\n\nRothman's remarks follow a speech he delivered to a visiting IHF delegation currently visiting Israel to express solidarity with Jewish state. The mission, led by Executive Director Rabbi David Katz and Executive Vice President Dr. Joseph Frager, visited the Gaza periphery and the site of the Nova music festival where hundreds of innocent attendees were killed. The delegation included former U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland Edward McMullan, and Holocaust survivor and IHF Honorary President Jerry Wartski.\n\nPresident Biden has repeatedly expressed frustration over Israel's right-wing parties, and the Religious Zionism faction in particular, viewing them as an obstacle to his vision for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Meanwhile, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the Religious Zionism party, has blasted the Biden administration for \"pushing Israel towards suicide for years\" by advocating for a \"two-state solution.\"\n\nThe largely failed two-state solution for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- vehemently rejected by both sides -- is still being pushed by President Biden, who insists that it is the \"only way\" to ensure long-term security for both Israelis and Palestinians in a new post-Hamas Gaza.\n\nThe so-called two-state solution -- which calls for the creation of a Palestinian state, ostensibly in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and some eastern sections of Jerusalem, in exchange for the terror-supporting Palestinian Authority ending its conflict with Israel and living at peace with the Jewish state -- has long proved to be an abject failure.\n\nDespite the numerous proposals, every Israeli attempt to offer land concessions for a Palestinian state has been met with terror waves. After years of failed negotiations and Israel's disastrous evacuation of the Gaza Strip, which resulted in Hamas's takeover of that territory and repeated rocket attacks from there, a growing share of Israelis have grown more skeptical of a two-state solution, largely rejecting any withdrawal from the West Bank, according to a Pew Research Center survey which took place prior to October 7, 2023.\n\nSince the October 7 massacre, Israelis -- even more so -- overwhelmingly reject a two-state solution. Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that he will not allow a Palestinian state as long as he remains in office.\n\nIn contrast with the Biden administration's policies, President Trump did not unequivocally endorse the two-state solution, saying he was also open to a one-state solution -- presumably meaning Israeli annexation of the West Bank -- and that he would accept whatever solution Israelis and Palestinians themselves chose. In addition, the Trump administration cut aid to the Palestinians over its boycott of the U.S., as well as its so-called pay-for-slay scheme, and closed the Palestinian mission in Washington, expelling the Palestinian Ambassador to the U.S., Hussam Zomlot.\n\nIn November, Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders caused an uproar after declaring that the country of Jordan should be considered the true national homeland for the Palestinian people, given that it has a majority Palestinian population and integrating Palestinians into Jordan could lead to a more stable regional situation, as the Hashemite Kingdom has successfully integrated Palestinian refugees.\n\nPreviously, former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson suggested the creation of a Palestinian state in Egypt in order to distance Israel from threats posed by it.\n\nPresident Biden's insistence stands despite the recent October 7 massacre, which saw the Hamas terrorist group perpetrate the deadliest attack against Jewish people since the Nazi Holocaust. The massacre saw the torture, rape, execution, immolation, and abduction of hundreds of Israeli civilians, as well as widespread Palestinian support for it.\n\nThe large-scale slaughter, which drew parallels to scenes from the Holocaust, resulted in roughly 1,200 dead inside the Jewish state, over 4,800 wounded, and at least 241 hostages of all ages taken -- of which nearly 140 remain in Gaza.\n\nThe vast majority of the victims are civilians and include dozens of American citizens.\n\nIn addition, Republican officials continue to lambaste the Biden administration for withholding crucial ammunition from Israel in its war on the Hamas terror group, accusing the president of \"carrying water for the pro-Hamas mob\" to \"appease his radical anti-Semitic base\" and the Democrat party's \"pro-Hamas wing\" for his own personal political gain.\n\nCritics of Biden's decision have argued that withholding weapons that Congress has already authorized, absent any finding of human rights violations by Israel, is unconstitutional and violates the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.\n\nSome Republicans have even drafted impeachment articles against the president, citing the abandonment of a key U.S. ally and a potential weakening of U.S. foreign policy stance.\n\nAccording to former President Donald Trump, President Biden \"has totally abandoned Israel.\"", "source":

Yet, this noble pursuit faces a landscape increasingly resistant to such dreams.\n\nIn the aftermath of the harrowing October 7 attack by Hamas, which claimed the lives of 1,200 people and saw 253 taken hostage, the Israeli public's appetite for a two-state solution has waned significantly. Recent surveys reflect a dramatic shift: a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute after October 7 found that only 14% of right-wing Israelis now believe a peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state is possible. This skepticism permeates the broader society, with only 35% of the general population expressing optimism about such a future.\n\nThe brutal reality of violence has overshadowed hopes for peace, transforming public opinion and solidifying the perception that territorial concessions equate to security risks. Historical experiences, such as the 2005 Gaza disengagement, have left deep scars, reinforcing fears that a Palestinian state could become a launchpad for more attacks. This sentiment is echoed across political lines, with many Knesset members, especially from right-wing and religious factions, opposing the two-state framework.\n\nDespite international pressure to revive the two-state solution, including from the Biden administration, Israeli leaders and a significant portion of the public remain unconvinced. They prioritize immediate security needs over long-term diplomatic solutions that seem increasingly impractical under current conditions.\n\nHope for two-states eroding among the Israeli public\n\nThe concept of a two-state solution is not new; it has been a cornerstone of peace efforts for decades, espoused by numerous US presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Yet, the persistent violence and lack of trust have repeatedly undermined these efforts. The latest poll by the Israel Democracy Institute highlights that while 62% of Israelis support the idea of \"two states for two peoples,\" the confidence in achieving this has eroded.\n\nOctober 7 was a stark reminder of the volatility in the region. For many Israelis, the attack reinforced the notion that any future Palestinian state must come with robust security guarantees. The historical precedents are sobering: the Second Intifada, the withdrawal from Gaza, and the subsequent rise of Hamas have all contributed to a deep-seated wariness about making further concessions.\n\nMoreover, the political landscape in Israel has shifted significantly to the right and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government includes several coalition partners who are staunchly opposed to a Palestinian state. This reality makes it increasingly difficult for any government to pursue a path leading to such a Palestinian state.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are voices in Israel that continue to advocate a two-state solution. Former prime minister Ehud Olmert and security experts like Yaakov Peri argue that while the current sentiment is against it, leadership and decisive action could shift public opinion. They draw parallels to historical peace agreements, such as the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, which initially faced significant skepticism but has endured for decades.\n\nIn a notable development in February, the Knesset voted overwhelmingly against the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu hailed the vote as a clear message to the world that unilateral actions would only endanger Israel and obstruct peace efforts. It underscored the prevailing sentiment in Israel that any move towards a Palestinian state must be carefully negotiated and secured.\n\nThe Biden administration, along with the European Union and other actors, continues to push for the revival of the two-state solution. However, this must come with an understanding of the current Israeli psyche.\n\nThe fear of repeating mistakes where territorial concessions brought increased violence, looms large. For any new diplomatic efforts to succeed, they must confront these fears head-on. Proposals must include robust mechanisms to ensure demilitarization and political stability.

In 2017, Hamas amended its charter to accept the existence of Israel based on borders established after the six-day war in 1967. It reportedly indicated recently a willingness to disarm if a Palestinian state were established. But the present Israeli government led by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu remains implacably opposed to a two-state solution.\n\nCould things be different under different leadership? To answer this, we need to know whether the Israeli and Palestinian people could be persuaded to accept such a plan. Here it's worth taking a look at what polling tells us.\n\nPoliticians all too often find it convenient to blame the public for their failures. This is particularly true of failed peacemaking. The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) has tracked the ups and downs of support for the two-state solution from a high of 51% and 53% for Palestinians and Israeli Jews in polls taken in 2016 to a low of 33% and 34% respectively in 2022.\n\nBut pollsters in both Israel and Palestine, who do excellent work to the highest technical standards, sadly have had little or no opportunity to measure public opinion in support of a successful peace process. They measure the situation as it is - in the context of failure. Instead they need to measure what could be, how attitudes could change given proactive political leadership determined to get to peace. With such leadership the numbers change significantly.\n\nMost recently, on the Palestinian side the Institute for Social and Economic Progress asked the two-state solution question in March 2024 in the context of \"serious negotiations\" and got a 72.5% positive response. This contrasted with PCPSR results a few months earlier in December 2023 which registered support for the two-state solution at only 34% among Palestinians when framed without the context of serious negotiations. Clearly \"serious negotiations\" are the key.\n\nOn the Israeli side, a poll run for the Geneva Initiative in January 2024 got a result of 51.3% support for the two-state solution. Specifically, this was framed in the context of a \"return of the hostages agreement, to establish in the future a non-militarised Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and total normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia\". This was only two percentage points below the high point of support at 53% recorded by the PCPSR in 2016.\n\nSecurity has always been the top priority for Israelis and when that is factored in, success in negotiations can be assured. And significantly demilitarising a future Palestine is not a deal-breaker for the Palestinians, according to the Institute for Social and Economic Progress March 2024 poll.\n\nA PCPSR poll completed for the Palestine Peace Initiative also in March 2024 found that 50.4% of respondents said the two-state solution would be acceptable to Palestinians providing they also get security and an independent state free from occupation.\n\nThe solution then to the implementation of the two-state solution appears to be to combine all the elements that can make it a success.\n\nAdditionally the scale that is used is also important. In real negotiations it is important to know where the \"red lines\" are and what the people can be persuaded to accept given positive political leadership.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, where public opinion polls were used to detail every element of a peace agreement, the people were asked what was: \"essential\" (a red line), what was \"desirable\" or \"acceptable\", what was \"tolerable\" (not wanted but with political leadership could be made into a \"yes\"), and what was \"unacceptable\" under any circumstances (another red line).\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Israel failed to learn from the Northern Ireland peace process\n\nWhen we used this scale to gauge support for a two-state solution in 2009, only 21% of Israelis and 24% of Palestinians considered it \"unacceptable\". This compares very favourably with equivalent results for views of power sharing in Northern Ireland in polls I conducted in January 1998 that found it was \"unacceptable\" for 52% of Protestants and 27% of Catholics. Despite this, with political leadership from the UK, Ireland, the US and EU working together, peace was made.\n\nClearly the same can be done for Israel and Palestine with the full support of the international community.\n\nJust to make sure, Mina Zemach - the pollster I work with in Israel - ran the 2009 two-state solution (TSS) question for me again in May 2024. The findings are published here for the first time. The result among Israeli respondents was 43% \"unacceptable\". It was not as good as the 2009 result - but still better than the result for Northern Ireland where peace was achieved.\n\nCritically then, the two-state solution needs to be tested along with all the positive elements of incentives and process, both international and domestic, that can be deployed to maximise the potential for getting to peace. And when we know what that magic formula is - do it. Turn fiction into fact and end this forever war.\n\nColin John Irwin receives funding from: Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Center for Democracy and Reconciliation in South East Europe, Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, OneVoice, Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (now FCDO), Economic and Social Research Council (UK ESRC), United Nations, InterPeace, Health and Welfare Canada, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), British Academy, Norwegian Peoples Aid, The Day After, No Peace Without Justice, US Department of State, Local Administrations Council Unit (Syria), Asia Foundation, Department for International Development (UK DFID), OpenAI, Atlantic Philanthropies, Universities: Dalhousie, Manitoba, Syracuse, Pennsylvania, Queens Belfast, Liverpool.

In 2010-2011 a number of South American countries joined in, including Argentina, Brazil and Chile.\n\nIn November 2012, the Palestinian flag was raised for the first time at the United Nations in New

The former is either a threat to wipe out Israel completely or a call for some sort of 2-state solution. The protesters mostly claim they don't mean the former but we all know that's exactly what Hamas means. They don't want a 2-state solution, they want a one state solution with Israel driven off the map.\n\nNevertheless, President Biden is supposedly working on a 2-state solution which would, in theory, free Palestine.\n\nUS President Joe Biden says he is \"working to make sure we finally get a two-state solution\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during a much-anticipated address at the graduation ceremony of Morehouse College in Atlanta...\n\n\"I've also been working around the clock for more than just [a] ceasefire. I'm working to bring the region together, working to build a lasting, durable peace,\" Biden says, referring to the normalization agreement he is trying to broker between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But the deal is conditioned on Israel agreeing to a pathway to a future Palestinian state -- a condition that Netanyahu again rejected on Saturday...\n\n\"I'm working to make sure we finally get a two-state solution -- the only solution for the two people to live in peace, enjoy their dignity,\" he adds.\n\nYesterday, author Salman Rushdie pointed to the obvious flaw in this plan. If you \"free Palestine\" right now what you'll get is not more freedom but another Islamic theocracy.\n\nCommenting on the US campus protesters calling for a free Palestine, the author said that while he has \"argued for a Palestinian state for most of my life - since the 1980s, probably - right now, if there was a Palestinian state, it would be run by Hamas, and that would make it a Taliban-like state, and it would be a client state of Iran\".\n\nHe's right of course. You can't give Palestinians a state now because Hamas is still in control. Rewarding them with a state would only create a mini-Iran right next to Israel. It would be a matter of months until the next attack.\n\nAs for the idea that we should plan for what happens after Hamas is removed from power, that seems a bit optimistic. The president of Iran just died in a helicopter crash. Are we planning for what happens after the end of the Iranian regime? Not really, because no one expects it to end just because a couple of its leaders died. There are more extremists where they came from.\n\nAt least in Iran polls suggest a majority of people would oppose the mullahs if given a chance at a vote on the question. That's probably not the case in Gaza. Free and fair elections there would not produce a more moderate, democratic state. They would empower something just like Hamas or the Taliban or the Iranian mullahs. That's the situation we're in. As Rushdie points out, student protesters don't seem very interested in what \"free Palestine\" would lead to, probably because they know it would be another brutal Islamic theocracy.\n\nThe fact is that any normal person can only be shocked by what is happening in Gaza, by the extent of the innocent deaths. But I think the demonstrators could also mention Hamas. Because it all started with them. And Hamas is a terrorist organization. And it's strange that a young progressive student politician supports a fascist terrorist group, because that's what they do in a way. They demand \"free Palestine\", liberate Palestine.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post ran an editorial yesterday arguing that a 2-state solution will never be accepted by Israelis unless it comes with security guarantees.\n\nThe Biden administration, along with the European Union and other actors, continues to push for the revival of the two-state solution. However, this must come with an understanding of the current Israeli psyche.\n\nThe fear of repeating mistakes where territorial concessions brought increased violence, looms large. For any new diplomatic efforts to succeed, they must confront these fears head-on. Proposals must include robust mechanisms to ensure demilitarization and political stability. Only then can Israel's public begin to entertain such ideas.\n\nWhile Biden's commitment to a two-state solution resonates with long-standing US policy and ideals, it clashes with the harsh realities and prevailing sentiments. So without concrete assurances of security and stability, the two-state solution remains a distant and unattainable goal for most Israelis.\n\nWould Hamas, or whatever similar leadership follows it, be willing to give up its weapons in exchange for a state?

Norway, Spain and Ireland said they believe the move will help foster a two-state solution and a path to peace.\n\nIsrael is in the middle of a war to obliterate Hamas, prompted by the October 7 attack. That war has left an estimated 35,000 Palestinians dead, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\n\"This step comes at a critical hour when Israel and the occupation is trying to derail this conflict and destroy the chances to achieve peace between peoples,\" said Ammar Hijazi, Palestinian Assistant Minister for Multilateral Affairs.\n\nBut Israel likens the move to recognize the Palestinian state to a reward for terrorism.\n\n\"It's a huge gift to the Axis of Evil, because they will understand that if you attack Israel, Europe, United Kingdom, United States, then you will get a prize,\" Akunis said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement about the hostage video:\n\n\"I am shocked by the video documenting the kidnapping of our precious female observers.

I intend to stop the transfer funds and demand the return of all funds transferred,\" Smotrich wrote to the prime minister.\n\nApproximately 1 billion shekels ($272 million) has been parked in Norway over the past three months, while Jerusalem transfers some 600 million shekels ($163 million) to Ramallah directly every month.\n\n\"The Palestinians are working against Israel with political terrorism and promoting unilateral measures around the world -- I cannot continue to transfer funds to them. If this causes the P.A. to collapse, let it collapse,\" Ynet cited Smotrich as saying.\n\nThe finance minister also decided to cancel a waiver shielding major Israeli banks with business ties to Ramallah from lawsuits stemming from charges of supporting terrorism, a move that the United States previously warned would collapse the Palestinian Authority's economy.\n\nIn addition, the Religious Zionism Party leader demands that Netanyahu take a series of steps to bolster Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, including the immediate approval of 10,000 new housing units, establishing a new town for each country recognizing \"Palestine\" and advancing a proposal to strengthen Israel's hold on the area.\n\nSmotrich is also requesting that the government permanently revoke all VIP travel passes for P.A. officials and impose additional sanctions on those leading the campaign against Israel in international bodies.\n\n\"I and many other ministers have made an unequivocal demand to take severe measures against the Palestinian Authority for its unilateral actions against Israel, including its pursuit of unilateral recognition of statehood at the U.N. and through bilateral agreements with several countries, and the legal battle it's waging against the State of Israel in the international court at The Hague to stop the war,\" wrote the minister.\n\n\"I don't intend to allow officials to dismiss the issue. There's urgency for an immediate response that will impose a significant cost on the P.A. for its actions and deter it and other countries,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_and_Samaria_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judea and Samaria Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shekel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ynet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ynet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-22-at-12.17.37\u202fPM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 802, "textEnd": 808}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

But symbolism has its place, not least in international relations. Yesterday's recognition by Ireland of the state of Palestine is, therefore, of some consequence.\n\nThe fact that the well-flagged statement was synchronised with parallel announcements from the Norwegian and Spanish governments adds to its weight. Formal recognition by the three countries on May 28th will bring to eight the number of European states which now recognise Palestine. Some 143 of the 193 member nations of the United Nations currently do so. Slovenia, Malta and Belgium are considering their positions.\n\nWhat difference will this make to the millions of Palestinians suffering in Gaza, the millions more under occupation in the West Bank, or, indeed, the many displaced in surrounding countries or further afield?\n\nIn the short term, probably very little. But the recognition represents a further ratcheting up of international opposition to the aggressive and inhumane war being prosecuted by Israel's military in Gaza, and to the irredentist policies pursued by its right-wing government.\n\nThe war has deepened divisions among democratic states as well as within international institutions over how best to respond to its appalling humanitarian consequences.\n\nIsrael has now recalled its ambassador from Dublin and imposed diplomatic sanctions on the Irish, Norwegian and Spanish ambassadors to Israel. The chairman of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland echoed Israeli criticism that the recognition rewarded Hamas for the atrocities it perpetrated in its attack of October 7th. That reaction will hardly come as a surprise, although all three Government party leaders on Wednesday reiterated their absolute condemnation of Hamas.\n\nIt remains to be seen what recognition means in practice. Despite yesterday's statement, there is no physical Palestinian state, just two separate strips of territory. One of these, Gaza, is nominally ruled by a terrorist organisation and has been devastated by seven months of bombardment. The other, the occupied West Bank, is supposedly governed by the inneffectual and corrupt Palestinian Authority, with its territorial integrity all but destroyed by decades of illegal settlement and expropriation.\n\nIsrael's embassy said the recognition undermined the country's sovereignty and security. The Palestinian Authority said that it affirmed Palestine's right to self-determination. It would be easy to despair that the chasm between the two will never be bridged. But it is incumbent on the international community to continue to seek a peaceful solution. The recognition of Palestine is a timely contribution to that process.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I'm sure you remember that two weeks ago I already contacted you and demanded that you prepare drastic response measures.\"\n\nSmotrich noted: \"Unfortunately, the matter has not been dealt with and there are those who think you are probably trying to procrastinate. In the discussion yesterday at the National Security Council, officials and advisers as usual presented a plethora of reasons why, \"this is not the right timing\" ... I do not intend to allow these officials to delay this matter! It is extremely urgent that Israel issues an immediate response that will demand a significant price from the Palestinian Authority for its actions, and deter it and other countries to stop this movement.\"\n\nThe Minister of Finance detailed his demands for measures to be taken against the Palestinian Authority:\n\n1. Immediately convene the Planning Council in Judea and Samaria for the approval of ten thousand housing units ready for professional promotion, including in area E1.\n\n2. A decision to be approved as early as tomorrow at the Cabinet meeting on the establishment of a new town every time another country unilaterally recognizes the Palestinian state. Three countries intend to announce their unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state today. I have instructed the Settlement Directorate to prepare a viable plan for three strategic towns, and I demand that such a decision be approved as soon as tomorrow.\n\n3. Another decision that must be brought to the cabinet tomorrow is the cancellation of the \"Norwegian Outline,\" that was approved by the cabinet a few months ago. Norway was the first to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state today and it cannot be a partner in any matters related to Judea and Samaria. I intend to stop transferring funds to them and demand the return of all the transferred funds.\n\n4. Advancing the proposal to strengthen communities in Judea and Samaria, a decision that was supposed to be taken immediately after Sukkot and was postponed due to the Gaza war. These communities protect Israel and as part of our lessons from October 7, are a vital Zionist possession to ensure that Kfar Saba does not become Kfar Gaza, God forbid. As Minister of Finance, I will find the necessary budgets for this.\n\n5. Permanently canceling all VIP permits of senior PA officials at all border crossings and imposing additional financial sanctions on PA senior officials and their families.", "source": {"uri": "israelnationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel National News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hezki_baruch@israelnationalnews.com", "name": "Hezki Baruch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_and_Samaria_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judea and Samaria Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sukkot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Saba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kfar Saba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kfar Saba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://a7.org/files/pictures/1200x930/1119273.jpg?autocrop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590705", "eventUri": "eng-9590705", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3500, "textEnd": 3509}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

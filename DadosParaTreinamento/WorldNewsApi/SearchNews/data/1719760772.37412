Cllr Catherine Slattery, Fianna Fail, made the call at this month\u2019s metropolitan district meeting. She said residents at estates in her electoral area, like Glasgow Park, Oakwood, Old Singland Road, Hilltop and St Patrick\u2019s Road would be better served if some of the smaller green spaces were taken away or cut into. \u201cWhile we need some green spaces for children to play, what I\u2019m finding on the doorstep is a lot of families might have two and three cars and they\u2019d be parked on footpaths all over the place,\u201d she said. She insisted she did not want to see green areas removed in their entirety - just enough to accommodate a few more spots for cars. She said the council has already done similar at its new Hawthorn Drive development in Rathbane. \u201cWhen it suits them to put cycle lanes in, it's ok to cut away the green spaces there. But they won't cut away to help residents,\u201d she said.

Most people in Glasgow Park would love the green separators to be taken away. As it stands, Glasgow Park is overran with cars,\u201d said Cllr Slattery. In a reply to the question, council\u2019s head of strategy in transport Hugh McGrath wrote: \u201cAny proposals to reduce green areas to make provision for parking would need to go through a planning and consultation process.\u201d He said a certain amount of green space needs to be retained in estates in order to comply with planning permissions, and said other options to resolve issues should be considered before loss of grass.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_05_27/Removal_of_cranes_from_Parkway_Valley_Shopping_Centre_28396391-1716799592569_1716799625.jpg--_replace_green_spaces_with_parking_spots___says_councillor.jpg?1716799625819\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />A COUNCILLOR wants to see green areas in estates used to accommodate more parking spots.

Spotify investing in more features and content, with recent additions like audiobooks and focus on podcast profitability. Despite recent investments, Spotify adjusts prices to boost revenues and potentially make Hi-Fi tier a reality.\n\nSpotify announced today that it will be \"adjusting\" the prices for all its Premium plans in the United States. The streaming platform, based in Sweden, had just raised its prices last summer for the first time since launching in the US back in 2011. \"So that we can continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices,\" Spotify said.\n\nSpotify will now be increasing the monthly subscription cost of its Individual plan by $1, its Duo plan by $2, and its Family plan by $3. The only premium plan in the US not receiving a price hike is its student plan, which will remain at $6 per month.\n\nIt's a time of change at Spotify\n\nThe company has spent the last few years reinventing itself\n\nThese price hikes come as Spotify ramps up its investments in the streaming platform, focused on bringing more features and content to its almost 250 million premium subscribers and over 600 million total users. Most recently, Spotify added support for audiobooks in 2022 and has continued growing that library since. Just last week, Spotify ended all support for it's Car Thing dashboard accessory, which the company launched in 2021 before unceremoniously discontinuing it a year later. Many users, myself included, have also been hoping that Spotify would add a High Fidelity tier to their plans to compete with the likes of Tidal. The chances of Hi-Fi on Spotify had been looking increasingly grim recently, but perhaps the company's now boosted revenues can make such investments a reality.\n\nRelated Spotify HiFi Platinum plan could be on its way soon The upgraded plan will offer lossless audio for those who want it.\n\nAs recently as last year, Spotify had been investing heavily in podcasts, inking exclusive deals worth tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars with the likes of Joe Rogan and Prince Harry. While exclusive deals may not be seen as often in the future, given their high cost, Podcasts still play a key role in Spotify's drive for increased profitability. Of the top 25 podcasts on Spotify in the US, nine are Spotify originals. The company has recently reported a substantial gain in gross margins, aided by increased profitability in both podcasting and music. In their last earnings report, Spotify shared that \"Podcast advertising revenue grew faster than music, driven by significant growth in impressions sold across Original and Licensed podcasts.\"\n\nSo now, for the second time in less than 12 months, Spotify is altering the deal.

Spotify then launched a $9.99 per month standalone audiobook tier in March in the US.\n\nOn Spotify's Q1 earnings call on April 23, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek confirmed that a new 'music-only' subscription tier is coming to the platform. The cost and launch date of that 'music-only' haven't been confirmed yet.\n\nOn Spotify's Updates landing page about the price updates, the company writes: \"As we continue to grow our platform, we are updating our Premium prices so that we can keep innovating in changing market conditions.

Plans are increasing by as much as $3 per month, so it might be time to reevaluate whether Spotify is the best music streaming service for your needs.\n\nThe official announcement comes shortly after rumors broke that the company plans to increase the cost of its popular music streaming subscriptions. The company took to its blog to reveal the price increases. It also said that subscribers will receive an email letting them know about the impending price increase.\n\nStarting with the Individual plan, Spotify is bumping it by $1 to $11.99 monthly. That's not a huge jump, but relative to the original cost, it's just under a 10% increase, which makes the increase feel proportionately larger.\n\nThe Duo plan is getting a $2 monthly bump to $16.99, which makes sense as the company appears to be trying to get $1 per active user.\n\nFollowing the same pricing trend, the Family plan is going up by $3 per month to $19.99. While this might seem like the worst deal, if you have more than three people using the Family plan, the increase per user is actually lower than the other plans (it allows for up to six individual users on the plan).\n\nThe Student plan is staying the same this time at $5.99 monthly. If you're eligible for this subscription option, enjoy the lower price while you can, as Spotify Premium for under $6 per month is a great deal.\n\nThe new rates will start in July for existing subscribers. If you're new to Spotify and thinking about signing up, the new prices are already listed on the company's website, so you'll be subject to them now.\n\nThis is sure to upset plenty of Spotify users. It'll be interesting to see if subscriber numbers drop because of the increased cost or if most users will just ride it out because their listening history is attached to the service. If you decide to cancel Spotify Premium, here's how to do it.\n\nPersonally, I switched to YouTube Music for a while.

Spotify then launched a $9.99 per month standalone audiobook tier in March in the US.\n\nOn Spotify's Q1 earnings call on April 23, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek confirmed that a new 'music-only' subscription tier is coming to the platform. The cost and launch date of that 'music-only' tier have not yet been confirmed yet.\n\nOn Spotify's landing page about its price updates, the company writes: \"As we continue to grow our platform, we are updating our Premium prices so that we can keep innovating in changing market conditions.

The Premium Family plan, which provides access for as many as six members in one household, is increasing by $3 to $19.99 a month from $16.99. The company last raised prices on its subscription plans for US listeners, its biggest market, in July 2023.\n\nSpotify said the move was necessary \"so that we can continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience.\"\n\nSpotify shares were up 5.7% to $313.71 at 9:37 a.m. in New York.\n\nBloomberg News reported in April that a price increase was on the way as Spotify seeks long-term profitability. The company raised the cost of membership in five other markets in April. The higher prices will help cover the cost of audiobooks, a popular service introduced late last year that offers customers up to 15 hours of book listening a month as part of their paid plan. Spotify is also going to roll out a new basic pricing tier that will offer music and podcasts -- but not audiobooks -- for $11 a month, people familiar with the plans have said. Users of that plan will need to pay for audiobooks separately.\n\nAt the end of March, Spotify had 239 million Premium subscribers and 615 million monthly active listeners (including free and paid) around the world.\n\nWhile Spotify's move puts it at a premium to Apple Music's plan, which costs $10.99 a month for an individual account, the company has shown to have fiercely loyal listeners that will likely swallow the increase rather than sacrifice years of building playlists and saving favorite music. Spotify listeners are the least likely to cancel among the major video or audio streaming services in the US, according to the research firm Antenna.

Apple Music costs $10.99/month, and even Tidal, which was traditionally the most expensive music streaming service, costs just $10.99/month following a price drop earlier this year.\n\nSpotify's announcement comes just a couple of weeks after the company revealed plans to brick Car Thing units, the company's first piece of hardware which debuted less than two years ago.\n\nExisting Spotify customers can expect an email regarding the price change \"over the next month.\"", "source": {"uri": "9to5google.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Google"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_schoon@9to5google.com", "name": "Ben Schoon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Premium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube Premium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tidal (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Clubs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity_Cooking", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity Cooking", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/spotify-android-app-icon-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Now, the company has started increasing the price of its Premium plan again. Spotify has announced on its official blog the new prices that the different Premium plans will have, with up to a $3 increase for the family plan.\n\nThe price increase will take effect first in the United States, but as we have seen on other occasions and even with other services, it is very likely that this is a preview of a global increase for Spotify. This, in addition to the eventual arrival of a more expensive plan with Hi-Fi audio.\n\nCurrently, Spotify Premium plans range in price from $10.99 for the Individual plan to $16.99 for the Family plan. That, in the United States and other countries in which the payment currency is the US dollar, while In Spain and the rest of Europe the price ranges from 10.99 euros to 17.99 euros.\n\nBut the price of Spotify Premium is going to change, first in the United States and starting in July. These are the prices of the Spotify advanced plan, which includes all the benefits:\n\nAs you can see, the Family plan is the one with the highest price increase, for an additional 3 dollars each month. On the other hand, the Student plan is the only one that does not increase its price: it remains the same, $5.99 per month.\n\nSpotify explains that the price changes will become effective starting next July for all subscribers in the country. It remains to be seen when they will implement the price increase in other territories, and what price Spotify Premium will be in Europe after this increase.\n\nIn addition to Spotify Premium, the service offers a free versionalthough with some important differences: Spotify free includes ads when playing music, does not allow song downloads, has lower audio quality, and plays songs in random order. If you want all the benefits of Premium, you have to pay.

Spotify then launched a $9.99 per month standalone audiobook tier in March in the US.\n\nOn Spotify's Q1 earnings call on April 23, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek confirmed that a new 'music-only' subscription tier is coming to the platform. The cost and launch date of that 'music-only' tier have not yet been confirmed yet.\n\nOn Spotify's landing page about its price updates, the company writes: \"As we continue to grow our platform, we are updating our Premium prices so that we can keep innovating in changing market conditions.

Premium subscriptions are now $11.99, up from $10.99, while Duo and Family pricing has increased by $2 and $3, respectively. Current subscribers will begin experiencing these new prices in July.\n\nWe heard rumors of this price increase a few months ago. At that time, we assumed that Spotify was hoping to recoup costs from its new audiobook library. Spotify has not confirmed our suspicion and simply states that it will \"continue to invest in and innovate on our product features.\"\n\nSpotify Premium: $11.99 (Up from $10.99) Premium Duo: $16.99 (Up from $14.99) Premium Family: $19.99 (Up from $16.99) Premium Student: $5.99 (Unchanged)\n\nHistorically, Spotify has avoided price hikes. The company's Premium plan retained its original $9.99 price tag from 2011 to 2023. And when the first price hike arrived in 2023, most people could tolerate it -- a jump from $9.99 to $10.99 wasn't too unreasonable (and fell way short of the rate of inflation).\n\nToday's price hike is equally \"small,\" clocking in at just $1 extra for Premium individual subscribers. But it's far more worrying than last year's price hike, as it indicates that Spotify may continue charging customers more and more money. I'd like to point out that July 2024 is the anniversary of last year's price hike. While I'm a big fan of consistency, the idea that this could become an annual affair is nauseating. Other streaming services, including Peacock, have pulled similar \"anniversary\" price hikes this year, so it may be an industry trend.\n\nNote that Apple Music's current pricing is identical to Spotify's old pricing. If you want a music streaming subscription that costs $10.99 a month (or a family plan that's just $16.99), go check out Apple Music. (Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that Apple will maintain its pricing.)\n\nSpotify's updated pricing is already in effect for new subscribers. Existing customers will begin to feel the pain in July, which is just a month away at the time of writing. This price hike only applies to the United States, though Spotify adjusted its pricing in other regions (such as the UK) in the first months of 2024.\n\nSource: Spotify", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Amusement_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Amusement Centers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Zone_Empire", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Zone Empire", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screen-of-a-smartphone-with-the-spotify-play-queue-open-and-the-spotify-logo-in-front.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The price hike affects all Spotify plans, including Premium Duo and Family. The Family plan sees a $3 increase to $19.99. Spotify justifies the price bump by citing the need to invest in product offerings and features.\n\nSpotify last hiked its subscription prices in the US in July 2023, bumping up the Premium individual plan's price by $1 to $10.99. This hike came within two years of Spotify increasing its Family tier prices in the US by $1 in 2021. Less than a year later, the world's most popular music streaming service is getting another price bump. This time, the hike affects all of Spotify's plans, including Premium Duo and Family.\n\nRelated 5 tweaks to improve the Spotify experience on Android Use Spotify to the fullest with these simple features\n\nStarting July 2024, Spotify Premium will cost $11.99, up $1 from its current price. The Premium Duo plan is getting a $2 hike and will cost $16.99 from next month. Family plan is getting the biggest hike, with its price jumping by $3 from $16.99 to $19.99. Spotify will charge trial users at its current rate for the first month and switch them to the higher pricing from the billing cycle after that. So, why the price bump? The company says it is doing this so that it \"can continue to invest in and innovate on our product offerings and features, and bring you the best experience.\"\n\nSpotify officially announced the price hike in a blog post (via The Verge) and will email existing users to inform them about this. The US price increase comes a month after the music streaming service announced a similar price bump in some key international markets, like the UK and Australia.\n\nTime for Spotify to launch its lossless streaming tier Close\n\nAlmost all music streaming services have raised prices in the last year or two. But Spotify stands out among them for hiking its prices twice in the same time span. This is even though it lacks a lossless Hi-Fi streaming tier, which the company announced as far back as 2021. Recently leaked screenshots suggest the tier could launch soon, but at this point, it's better to wait for an official launch before getting your hopes high.\n\nThe price hike is unlikely to impact Spotify's growth. Even after last year's price bump, the streaming service added a record 113 million free and 31 million paid users in 2023. Combined with three rounds of layoffs, the company returned to profitability and posted a record operating profit of \u20ac168 million in Q1 2024.", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_streaming_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music streaming service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lossless compression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High fidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Zone_Empire", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Zone Empire", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/spotify-1-ap24-hero.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Starting in July, Spotify's premium individual plan in the U.S. will increase a dollar to $11.99 a month and the premium duo plan will jump a buck to $16.99 a month, while the premium family plan will leap-frog $3 to $19.99 a month. The premium student plan will remain $5.99 a month.\n\n\"On Spotify, users discover and enjoy music, podcasts, and audiobooks,\" the company said in its announcement on Monday (June 3). \"So that we can continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices.\"\n\nIn July 2023, the company enacted similar increases though the family plan was raised just a dollar from $15.99 to $16.99. Last year's bump in its individual subscription price was a change of pace for Spotify after holding steady at $9.99 in the U.S. for a dozen years. For most of its existence, the company focused on rapid subscription growth over profits, though the mood has since shifted, with major labels and others welcoming price hikes as streaming's importance to their bottom lines continues to increase.\n\nHow important? In the U.S, subscriptions accounted for 59.3% of total recorded music revenues in 2023, up from 57.8% in 2022. Globally, subs accounted for 48.9% of recorded music revenue in 2023, according to the IFPI, up from 48.3% in 2022.\n\nLabel leaders are open about wanting higher subscription prices. In early May, Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl called for \"further increases\" to subscription prices to \"ensure that the value that music provides to these platforms is properly recognized,\" and Sony Music Entertainment CEO Rob Stringer recently called on streaming services with ad-supported tiers -- ie, Spotify -- to start charging a \"modest fee.\"\n\nIn April, Bloomberg reported that Spotify would raise its prices in select markets, including the U.K. and Australia, and that the U.S. would soon follow. Spotify's willingness to raise prices in consecutive years pleased investors, and shares jumped 17.6% that week. Today's announcement that it would again raise fees in its largest market has Spotify's stock up nearly 6% in pre-market trading.\n\nThe price increase comes at the end of a \"period of relative peace\" between Spotify and music publishers following the former's decision to pay the latter -- and songwriters -- a discounted rate for streams on several tiers. Spotify reasoned that by adding audiobooks to premium offerings like individual, duo and family plans, these subscriptions are now \"bundles,\" a type of plan that qualifies for a discounted rate on U.S. mechanical royalties given that multiple products are offered under one price. According to Billboard estimates, that change will mean publishers and writers will earn about $150 million less in royalties over the course of its first bundled year.\n\nIn response, the NMPA sent the company a cease and desist for alleged unlicensed content and the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) filed a lawsuit explicitly about the bundling. In addition, the Recording Academy, Association of Independent Music Publishers (AIMP), Nashville Songwriters' Association International (NSAI) and more have made statements against the change.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_schneider@billboard.com", "name": "Marc Schneider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony Music Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Otis Redding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audiobook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_the_Phonographic_Industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Federation of the Phonographic Industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kyncl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kyncl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royalty payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recording_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Recording Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Songwriters_Association_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Songwriters Association International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cease and desist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/spotify-graphic-headphones-2024-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 618, "textEnd": 624}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The music streaming giant announced Monday that the cost of its 'Individual' ad-free premium subscription plans in the US will go up by $1 a month to $11.99. Duo, a discount plan for two people who live together, will go up $2 to $16.99, the company announced.\n\nA family plan, meanwhile, will increase by $3 to $19.99 starting in July. Spotify said it is raising prices in order to ' continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience .'\n\nSpotify last increased the cost of its ad-free premium plans in July 2023 - which was the first time it had increased rates in the US since launching in 2011. The Swedish company hiked the 'Individual' plan $1 from $9.99 to $10.99.\n\nThe latest increase means the cost of the plan has gone up by 20 percent in the last two years. Last year, the company said the market landscape has 'continued to evolve' since Spotify launched in 2008. Spotify, as well as other music and television streaming platforms, are hunting profits by raising prices amid increased competition in the market.\n\nThe music streamer has been trying to boost its margins in recent months through several rounds of layoffs and lowering market spending, after relying on promotions and hefty investments to drive user growth. Shares in the company rose more than 4 percent in morning trading following the announcement.\n\nSpotify's revenue in the US grew nearly 11 percent to $5.69 billion last year, according to the company's annual report. Alongside its ad-free premium services, the music, podcast and audiobook streaming platform also offers an ad-supported free plan.\n\nSpotify's quarterly profit hit $1.09 billion in April - with premium subscribers accounting for most of its revenue. The number of premium subscribers rose by 14 percent to 239 million in the first three months of this year.\n\nAs more and more streaming services have flooded the market, companies have had to hike their prices and alter their business models in an attempt to improve profitability. When it comes to television, eight of the nine major services have hiked their prices in the last year, DailyMail.com analysis revealed. Apple TV+, for example, increased the price of its ad-free tier by a huge 43 percent - from $6.99 to $9.99.\n\nDisney+, meanwhile, hiked the price of its offering by 27 percent - to $13.99 from $10.99. Last October, Netflix axed its 'basic' $9.99 per month ad-free plan for new members - and upped it to $11.99 for existing members . It means its cheapest plan without commercials for new joiners is the 'standard' one at $15.49 a month.\n\nOver the last year, streaming services have also increasingly clamped down on password sharing - following Netflix's lead. Disney announced earlier this year it would crack down on sharing accounts with people outside of the user's household across its platforms Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Singer KT Tunstall was one of many musicians who clapped back, posting, \"I for one don't make 'content'. I make music.\"\n\nOf course, music isn't free to create; in many cases, a song can be years in the making. Its recording could be the result of years spent learning to play or write, practicing or performing, and everything else that enables a song to exist.\n\nJust because it's now possible to record music yourself at home doesn't negate that; it's no more accurate than saying the cost of writing a novel, making a movie, or creating any other kind of art is close to zero. However, the fury of many musicians and music fans may not even make the slightest dent in Spotify's subscriber numbers.\n\nThat said, Spotify users in the United States having potentially been given another reason to think about switching, as while the furore over Ek's comment as still rumbling, the streaming service announced that it's raising prices for the second time in a year.\n\nThe standard Premium Plan for one user jumps by $1 to $11.99, the Duo Plan jumps by $2 monthly at $16.99, and the Family Plan gets the biggest increase, at $3 to $19.99 monthly. Students are safe from this latest price hike, with that discounted plan still $5.99 a month.\n\nSpotify has already put the increased prices into effect if you're new to the service, and within the next 30 days current subscribers will be notified of the change, and the price hike will go into effect.\n\nThe company claims that the price hikes are to ensure that it can still \"invest in and innovate on our product features\" and deliver the best experience. However, given Ek's comments about \"the cost of creating content being close to zero,\" you have to wonder why Spotify needs more cash.\n\nSpotify is the beneficiary of an interesting phenomenon in streaming: users of music streaming services are much less likely to switch streamers than TV and movie services users. According to research firm Antenna, fewer than 1.5% of Spotify subscribers switched providers in April, and its average churn rate - the proportion of people who switch from it - stays at around 2% throughout the year. Unlike TV and movie streaming, where we're fairly flighty, people tend to sign up for a music service and then stick with it.\n\nA big part of that is because there are real disincentives to switching services. If you've got hundreds of playlists and a recommendation engine that knows what you like, moving to a rival means either starting again from scratch or painstakingly recreating what you've already got.\n\nAt the same time, there are tools to migrate playlists, but it's still a lot of admin if you're a long-time user. And that's before you consider the additional features Spotify offers, such as Spotify Connect, podcasts, and audiobooks.\n\nThe sad fact for musicians is that people don't really care about the wider picture: if a streamer has the songs they want to play and if switching streamers is a pain, they'll stay where they are - even if the prices are going up, again.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carrie_marshall@techradar.com", "name": "Carrie Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_Tunstall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KT Tunstall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churn rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audiobook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYdGtpPEaYDGey2UyT2sX-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 288, "textEnd": 294}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

which was the first time it had increased rates in the US since launching in 2011.\n\nThe Swedish company hiked the 'Individual' plan $1 from $9.99 to $10.99.\n\nThe latest increase means the cost of the plan has gone up by 20 percent in the last two years.\n\nLast year, the company said the market landscape has 'continued to evolve' since Spotify launched in 2008.\n\nSpotify, as well as other music and television streaming platforms, are hunting profits by raising prices amid increased competition in the market.\n\nThe music streamer has been trying to boost its margins in recent months through several rounds of layoffs and lowering market spending, after relying on promotions and hefty investments to drive user growth.\n\nShares in the company rose more than 4 percent in morning trading following the announcement.\n\nSpotify's revenue in the US grew nearly 11 percent to $5.69 billion last year, according to the company's annual report.\n\nAlongside its ad-free premium services, the music, podcast and audiobook streaming platform also offers an ad-supported free plan.\n\nSpotify's quarterly profit hit $1.09 billion in April - with premium subscribers accounting for most of its revenue.\n\nThe number of premium subscribers rose by 14 percent to 239 million in the first three months of this year.\n\nAs more and more streaming services have flooded the market, companies have had to hike their prices and alter their business models in an attempt to improve profitability.\n\nWhen it comes to television, eight of the nine major services have hiked their prices in the last year, DailyMail.com analysis revealed.\n\nApple TV+, for example, increased the price of its ad-free tier by a huge 43 percent - from $6.99 to $9.99.\n\nThe latest increase means the cost of the 'Individual' ad-free plan has gone up by 20 percent in the last two years (Pictured: Spotify CEO Daniel Ek)\n\nThe vast majority of streaming platforms have increased in price in the last year - some by as much as 43 percent\n\nDisney+, meanwhile, hiked the price of its offering by 27 percent - to $13.99 from $10.99.\n\nLast October, Netflix axed its 'basic' $9.99 per month ad-free plan for new members - and upped it to $11.99 for existing members.\n\nIt means its cheapest plan without commercials for new joiners is the 'standard' one at $15.49 a month.\n\nOver the last year, streaming services have also increasingly clamped down on password sharing - following Netflix's lead.\n\nDisney announced earlier this year it would crack down on sharing accounts with people outside of the user's household across its platforms Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet service provider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audiobook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Business_Plans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Business Plans", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/03/16/85656371-0-image-m-13_1717428389695.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The company on Monday hiked U.S. subscription prices for its premium services for the second time this year.\n\nPricing Vs. Apple Music\n\nStarting in July, Spotify Premium members will have to pay a dollar more for their individual subscriptions at $11.99 a month. The individual plan now will be priced $1 above Apple Music, noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report.\n\nFor investors in Spotify stock, two questions are whether Spotify will hike prices in more countries and how many subscribers would respond by canceling streaming services.\n\n\"If this price increase is carried out more broadly across the world, it could introduce greater churn impact than last July's 50-country price hike,\" added Mahaney. \"That said, this may well be a signal of Spotify's confidence in its value proposition, competitive position, and pricing power, especially as the prior price increases resulted in better-than-expected churn impact.\"\n\nFurther, Spotify stock holds a solid IBD Composite Rating of 84, according to IBD Stock Checkup.\n\nIBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nSpotify stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The current rating of SPOT stock indicates more funds are buying than selling.\n\nThe rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company on April 23 reported first-quarter earnings and sales that topped estimates. Spotify added three million premium subscribers, in line with views.\n\nCost-cutting measures including layoffs helped Spotify swing to a profit in the first quarter.\n\nThe audio entertainment service earned the equivalent of $1.05 a share on sales of $3.95 billion in the March quarter. Spotify reports financial results in euros.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet had predicted Spotify would earn 67 cents a share on sales of $3.85 billion. In the year-earlier period, Spotify lost $1.27 a share on sales of $3.34 billion.\n\nIn addition, Spotify stock ranks second out of 21 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Education and Media industry group.

The audio streamer said that it's increasing prices to \"continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience.\"\n\nSome of Spotify's other tiers are also getting price bumps. The monthly cost of Duo, a plan that lets two people split a premium plan, is rising by $2, to $16.99. The family plan is increasing prices by $3 to $19.99 per month.\n\nSpotify recently increased subscription prices for international subscribers, cut costs and underwent several rounds of layoffs including drastic reductions to its podcast business.\n\nStreaming, both music and television, is getting gradually more expensive for everyone as companies continue the elusive hunt for profits.

Here's what we're watching on TheStreet today.\n\nStocks are kicking off the first trading day of June after a banner month for the markets - all three major averages posted their sixth positive month in seven, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq notching its best month since November 2023. Investors are hoping to carry the momentum into June as they look ahead to the May jobs report out Friday and the Fed's interest rate decision on June 12th.\n\nIn other news - After raising its prices less than a year ago, Spotify is once again hiking the prices of its subscription plans. In July of 2023, the company raised prices between $1 and $3 depending on your subscription tier, and it's following roughly the same playbook this time around.\n\nMore on Price Increases:\n\nStarting in July, U.S. subscribers with an ad-free premium plan will pay $11.99 a month - that's a 20% increase over the past two years. Its Duo plan, which allows two people to split a premium account, will increase by $2, making the cost $16.99 a month. And Spotify's family plan will once again get a $3 price hike to $19.99 a month.\n\nIn a blog post, Spotify said \"So that we can continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices. Over the next month, subscribers in the US will receive an email explaining what this update means for their subscription.\"\n\nSpotify is just one of many streaming giants to hike prices recently. Netflix, Disney+, and Peacock have all become more expensive over several months.\n\nThat'll do it for your daily briefing. From the New York Stock Exchange, I'm Conway Gittens with TheStreet.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_mezistrano@kansascity.com", "name": "Rebecca Mezistrano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheStreet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TheStreet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/sbv3g6/picture288961885/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/0ceb1b5d-1102-4381-9bca-1f4e488c28f5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 146, "textEnd": 152}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 761, "textEnd": 770}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

At that point, the solo plan will cost $11.99, against $16.99 for Duo, $19.99 for the Family package (which supports up to six users), and $5.99 for the Student tier.\n\nIt's unclear whether increases are also set to hit different markets. Previously, reports pointed to imminent bumps in the U.K. and several other nations, but Spotify didn't appear to have publicly addressed the matter at the time of writing.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is the business's aggressive approach to boosting revenue and pursuing profitability. Last year's aforementioned streaming price spikes, starkly contrasting a long line of cost increases for video streaming services, brought a departure from the long-standard $9.99-per-month charge for individual subscribers in the States.\n\nNevertheless, all signs have since then pointed to continued subscription growth for Spotify and its main competitors. For Q1 2024, the service reported an average of 239 million subscribers (up 14 percent year over year) as well as 388 million ad-supported users.\n\nAnd with monetization also front of mind for the major labels - UMG's Lucian Grainge, WMG's Robert Kyncl, and SME's Rob Stringer have all hardly been subtle in their calls for heightened costs and ARPU - it'll be worth closely monitoring adjacent initiatives moving forward.\n\nKeeping the focus on Spotify, those initiatives could include add-ons, seemingly available to activate on all plans, like higher-quality audio, according to reports. More interesting yet, Stringer last week rather directly made the case for an additional charge on ad-supported streaming accounts in \"mature markets.\"\n\nTime will tell whether that charge, which could dissuade user sign-ups given the many available music streaming options, comes to fruition. But the earnest suggestion underscores the noted commitment to unlocking new digital revenue (the majors are also leaning into superfan initiatives in various ways) amid ongoing subscribership growth.\n\nWhile early social media responses to the Spotify price increases appear seem than positive, investors appear enthusiastic about the change. At $310.79 per share, Spotify stock (NYSE: SPOT) is currently up 4.72 percent on the day and nearly 100 percent from early June of 2023.\n\nShare on:\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link", "source": {"uri": "digitalmusicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Music News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_smith@digitalmusicnews.com", "name": "Dylan Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Stringer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Stringer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian_Grainge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucian Grainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kyncl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kyncl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Spotify-Price-Increases-June-2024-FT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620166", "eventUri": "eng-9620166", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account?

Especially if you're an artist who gets paid fractions of a cent for their 'content,'\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Music will still be valued in a hundred years. Spotify won't. It will only be remembered as a bad example of a parasitic tool for extracting value from other peoples music. (or \"content\" as some grifters like to call it) AI will seal your fate,\" another person added.\n\nEk responded to the backlash in a subsequent post on Sunday.\n\n\"Obviously seeing the feedback to this one and wanted to respond. It's clear I was far too vague in the post, including with my clumsy definition of content. I understand how it came across as very reductive and that wasn't my intent,\" he wrote. \"Just to clarify - my original point was not to devalue the time, effort, or resources involved in creating meaningful works, whether it's music, literature, or other forms of creative expression.\"\n\nHe also tried to reword his original remarks.\n\n\"The significant drop in the cost of creation tools (microphones, laptops, cameras) has led to an unprecedented explosion in the volume of what people are able to produce,\" he said. \"Creation is only part of the equation.\"\n\nSpotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt makes sense that Ek is looking to address the criticism from his original post. Spotify has been trying to position itself as a creator platform in recent years, and angering or alienating content creators -- who go through the effort to make the music and podcasts that keep people coming back to Spotify -- wouldn't be good for business.\n\nThe company in 2022 said it had a \"vision to become the world's creator platform.\" Spotify has been trying to compete with TikTok on short video and discovery and YouTube on video podcasts.\n\nSpotify is also raising prices in the US, announcing on Monday that Premium plans would be increasing in July.

Two witnesses, Marie Adrian and Anna Ravn, told newspaper BT they had seen Frederiksen arrive at the square while they were sitting at a nearby fountain, just before 6:00 pm local time on Friday. \"A man came by in the opposite direction and gave her a hard shove on the shoulder, causing her to fall to the side,\" the two women told the newspaper. They added that while it was a \"strong push\", Frederiksen did not hit the ground. They described the man as tall and slim and said he had tried to hurry away but had not gone far before being grabbed and pushed to the ground by men in suits.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/assault-danish-pm-likely-not-politically-motivated-4396526", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--POJdbDa7--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/e0ffb57ba297c954bcf0cdfd0c4820dbf7e66dd7.jpg?itok=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:30:41", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": -0.313}

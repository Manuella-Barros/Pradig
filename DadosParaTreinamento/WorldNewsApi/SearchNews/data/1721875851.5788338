{"id": 239774860, "title": "David Quinn: Commercial surrogacy is a scandal unfolding before our very eyes", "text": "One of the scandals of our fairly recent past is the manner in which we sometimes conducted adoptions. A mother could be coerced into giving up her child, or it could be made impossible for a child ever to trace his or her mother in the future, or the birth certificate might be deliberately and illegally falsified \u2014 or a combination of all these things. We have heard the stories of grown-up adopted people desperately seeking out their natural parents, usually the mother, and speaking plaintively and sometimes angrily about the deliberate hole that was created in their lives by the severing of the natural ties. A lot of adopted people are perfectly content to have been adopted and the circumstances of their adoption are totally defensible, but even they are often left with unanswerable questions about their family tree and where they come from.", "summary": "<p>One of the scandals of our fairly recent past is the manner in which we sometimes conducted adoptions.

The Anfield club have confirmed that the former Match of the Day pundit is receiving treatment for an as yet unknown illness and will provide further updates in due course.

Hansen won everything there was to win with the Reds, lifting the European Cup three times as well as eight league titles, two FA Cups and three League Cups. The classy central defender won 26 caps for Scotland and played at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. His last match in the Dark Blue came in a 1-0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland in 1987 before hanging up his boots in 1991 and turning his hand to TV punditry with the BBC.

{"id": 243246740, "title": "MLB draft prospect Jac Caglianone 'very impressive' during Chicago visit", "text": "Florida first baseman/pitcher Jac Caglianone is projected to be one of the top picks in next month\u2019s MLB Draft. He possesses all the physical aptitude an organization could want in a young prospect. But as he made his rounds at Guaranteed Rate Field Thursday, there was one flaw he had that had to be overlooked. \u201cThe first thing is he\u2019s a Gator and Gators and Seminoles don\u2019t see eye to eye,\u201d said manager Pedro Grifol, who attended Florida State. \u201cBut we put that aside.\u201d Caglianone was in Chicago, presumably to meet with Sox brass for a pre-draft meeting. The Sox have the No. 5 pick in the 2024 MLB Draft, and Caglianone is one of the top prospects in the draft. The former Gator belted 35 home runs with 72 RBIs and 58 walks in 66 games. Caglianone also slashed .419/.544.875. Grifol was very complimentary toward Caglianone, noting his respectfulness and physical gifts as impressive. \u201cTV doesn\u2019t do any justice as far as how big he is,\u201d Grifol said. \u201cHe looks big on TV, but when you see him in person and he stood at home plate yesterday, when you see him in that box, he\u2019s a really, really impressive kid. \u201cHe\u2019s just big and strong and lean. He looks the part. That\u2019s what they look like at the top of the draft.\u201d Given the new draft rules, the highest pick the Sox can get is 10th. The team has to make the most out of its top-five selection this year. Trade speculation Trade season is heating up, with the deadline a little more than a month away. With an abundance of players that could be available, the Sox will be working the phones plenty over the next month. Reliever Michael Kopech is one of their most enticing players. The starter-turned-reliever has handled that transition well, pitching in 9 \u2154 high-leverage innings, the most on the team. With an explosive fastball \u2014 99th percentile for fastball velocity, according to Baseball Savant \u2014 and a penchant for strikeouts (93rd percentile), Kopech could be enticing as contenders look to bolster its bullpens for the stretch run. The right-hander, however, isn\u2019t fixated on where he goes. \u201cI try not to think too far ahead about it,\u201d Kopech said. \u201cYou hear a lot, especially around this time of year. Either way, it\u2019s baseball and I have a job to do. Right now, that job is here.\u201d Kopech has one more arbitration before becoming a free agent after the 2026 season. Injury update Grifol said right fielder Gavin Sheets, who left Tuesday\u2019s 4-0 loss to the Dodgers with a left heel contusion, is available to pinch hit and play first base, but he\u2019s not quite ready to play the field. However, Grifol said the team can \u201cpush it if we need to\u201d with Sheets. \u201cHe ran out there today,\u201d Grifol said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel great, but it feels OK. He\u2019s improved tremendously since yesterday, and he\u2019s close to being able to get out there like I said.\u201d Sheets was slashing .243/.337/.410 in his 74 games. The Sox sent Dominic Fletcher to the Sox\u2019 Arizona Complex League affiliate to rehab from his left shoulder strain that has kept him out of action since June 2.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2024/06/28/mlb-draft-prospect-jac-caglianone-very-impressive-during-chicago-visit", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/19f5b4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2723x1554+0+130/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2Fb5%2Ff6d5e8ff444c9ed7a797299e3d39%2Fjc.j", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:12:35", "author": "Kyle Williams", "authors": ["Kyle Williams"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.058}

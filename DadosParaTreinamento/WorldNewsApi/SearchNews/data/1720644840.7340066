{"id": 231281926, "title": "Emmanuel Petit picks between Arsenal and Chelsea to name perfect club for Benjamin Sesko", "text": "Former Arsenal and Chelsea star Emmanuel Petit has urged Benjamin Sesko to snub the Blues in favour of a move to the Gunners. The two London clubs are looking to sign a new striker this summer, with Sesko, who reportedly has a \u00a355million release clause in his contract with RB Leipzig, being heavily linked with a move to both sides. However, Petit believes the Slovenian ace should choose Arsenal over Chelsea. Speaking exclusively to Football London, via Best Online Poker Sites, he said: \"He should definitely pick Arsenal [over Chelsea]. Why? Because of the way they've been playing and the spine of the team have been playing together for at least four or five years. They have improved so much individually and collectively.\" He added: \"They have a proper philosophy of playing. And the environment as well. I think it's much better at Arsenal than at Chelsea, even though that did improve slightly at Chelsea over the last few months.\" He concluded by saying: \"But while it's a new era at Chelsea, the stability is with the Gunners. So there is more green light, if I was Sesko, to go to Arsenal instead of going to Chelsea.\" Sesko, 21, made the move to Leipzig last summer after two impressive seasons with their sister club, Red Bull Salzburg. Despite a slow start to the campaign, he netted 11 goals in 16 Bundesliga matches, including a seven-goal streak in seven games to end the season. The highly-touted youngster, who towers at 6ft 5ins, has drawn comparisons to football greats like Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Erling Haaland, thanks to his speed, strength, and versatile skill set that many top-tier centre forwards covet. He began his career in his home country of Slovenia before making the switch to Salzburg in 2019. He was subsequently loaned out to Austrian second-division team FC Liefering, where he scored an impressive 22 goals in 44 matches. Sesko returned to Salzburg in 2021 and added another 29 goals to his tally before transferring to Leipzig in 2023. Arsenal are keen to bolster their attacking options after falling short in the Premier League title race for the second year running, with Mikel Arteta seemingly unconvinced by Gabriel Jesus' long-term suitability as a centre forward, having deployed Kai Havertz in that role for much of the season. The Gunners have also been linked with potential moves for Brentford's Ivan Toney and Newcastle's Alexander Isak, among others. Chelsea have been on the hunt for a reliable striker since Romelu Lukaku's \u00a398million move didn't go as planned. They brought in Nicholas Jackson last summer, and while the Senegal forward netted a respectable 17 goals across all competitions, the Blues are still in need of a dedicated No. 9 to take his place at the front. Petit had a six-year stint in English football. He made the move from Monaco to Arsenal in 1997 and played a key role in securing a league and cup double in his debut season at Highbury. The midfielder quickly formed a strong partnership with Patrick Vieira, but it was disrupted when Petit left for Barcelona in 2000. After a year in Spain, he made his return to the Premier League, with Chelsea beating out competition from Manchester United and Tottenham for his signature. However, his time at Stamford Bridge was marred by poor form and injuries. The 1998 World Cup champion, who earned 63 caps for France, hung up his boots a year after leaving Chelsea in 2004. He later expressed regret over joining the Blues, revealing that his wife had persuaded him to turn down United in favour of a return to London.

That's exactly what Avi Schiffmann is building with his new startup.\n\nIs about Friend, an AI-powered companion that does not seek to make your life more productive, but to be a constant and supportive presence in your day to day life.\n\nFriend, formerly called Tab, is the evolution of an idea Schiffmann has been working on for the past few years. Far from focusing on increasing productivity like other AI products do -- such as Microsoft's Recall or Humane's ambitious AI Pin -- Friend is a smarter, more user-friendly, more productive, and more intuitive way to use it. Friend seeks to offer sincere companionship.\n\n\"It's not about doing more things or improving your skills. It's a friend, a companion who can be with you at all times, supporting your ideas and talking about your relationships and thoughts,\" Schiffmann explained in an interview with The Verge.\n\nThe idea behind Friend is not to replace human interactions, but to add an extra layer of companionship.\n\n\"I don't think I'm the only person you should talk to,\" Schiffmann clarifies.\n\nAnd it is that, instead of being just \"another chat on your phoneFriend is designed to be a constant companion. It's almost like you have someone with you all the time, but without having to keep an eye on a screen.\n\nFiend has a built-in microphone that can record what's happening in the environment or that you can talk to directly, but Schiffmann says he eventually wants to add a camera.\n\nThe concept of Friend is resembles Tamagotchis from a few years ago, but with the advantage of always being at your disposal.\n\nFriend integrates into your everyday life, and while it still has a long way to go, Schiffmann is optimistic about the impact it can have.\n\n\"This is a toy. I want people to see it like that,\" explains the entrepreneur with a smile on his face.\n\nFriend's design is simple: a glowing sphere that you can wear around your neck or clip to your clothing. And while it has no camera and its primary communication is via text in an app, Schiffmann sees this approach as more natural.\n\nWith the goal of building a social network for real, digital friends, Schiffmann is focused on improving the technology and exploring new ways to make Friend an essential part of everyday life.\n\nIf everything goes as the entrepreneur hopes, soon we could all have our own Friend, ready to share our journey and make us feel accompanied.\n\nAlthough the device is still in the prototype phase, Schiffmann plans to launch the first 30,000 devices in January 2025 at a price of US$99, with no subscription fees.", "source": {"uri": "bullfrag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bullfrag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaxon_miles@bullfrag.com", "name": "Jaxon Miles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.fayerwayer.com/resizer/v2/ACLQDREZJ5GCFKMRMOMOETM7VI.png?smart=true&auth=37660ae3fccdc1425853e7993034f215911e4d86a8457c4b62715115687fa137&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Pressing a button on the necklace allows the user to speak to Friend, with a message sent to the iPhone in response. Friend is also able to send messages without a conversational prompt, responding to what the wearer is doing.\n\nThe Friend and its \"memories\" are stored on the necklace, with nothing uploaded to cloud servers. Friend creator Avi Schiffmann said in a blog post that the device is an \"expression of how lonely\" he's felt. In an interview with The Verge, Schiffmann said that Friend is designed to be supportive, validating, and able to encourage ideas. \"It's a great brainstorming buddy,\" he said. \"You can talk to it about relationships, things like that.\"\n\nFriend is available for pre-order for $99, and it is set to launch in January 2025.\n\nArticle Link: New 'Friend' Necklace Offers AI Companionship", "source": {"uri": "forums.macrumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MacRumors Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wearable technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wearable computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.macrumors.com/social/?t=2432570&v=6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Avi Schiffmann's Friend is around his neck.\n\nSchiffmann, the former Mercer Island High School student who wowed the world as a teen with a website he built in 2020 to help track the spread of Covid-19, is back with technology that he hopes will change how people view and interact with artificial intelligence.\n\nFriend is an AI-enabled blood-cell-shaped pendant that hangs on a cord around a user's neck. The always-listening device is meant to be like a close companion, who you would share experiences with and develop a strong relationship with over time. From idle chit chat to deep talks, Friend is always up for conversation.\n\nThe hardware works in a couple different ways. A touchable light in the center of the device lets you speak directly to the AI and its replies are sent via text message from a companion app on your smartphone. Because Friend is always listening, it's also gathering context for what is happening in your life from various circumstances and conversations, and it can proactively offer its AI viewpoint via push notifications.\n\nDescribing a scene that could have come out of the 2003 film \"Lost In Translation,\" Schiffmann said an aha moment came to him earlier this year when he was lonely in a high-rise hotel in Tokyo. But he didn't daydream about Scarlett Johansson being there with him. He just wanted better AI.\n\n\"I was with my prototype, and I was just looking at it, and [realized] something that I want in a much deeper way is much more of a companion,\" Schiffmann said. \"Not just something to talk to, but I wanted to feel like there's this entity that's really traveling with me, and I'm really with an actual friend.\"\n\nThe $99 device is launching today for preorder, and will begin shipping in January.\n\nSchiffmann timed the release of Friend to United Nations \"International Day of Friendship\" -- a promotion of the \"shared spirit of human solidarity\" that can take many forms. The UN doesn't mention AI wearables, but that's not stopping Schiffmann's big vision.\n\nHe's raised $2.5 million for a company that aims to be more than a hardware startup.\n\n\"It's more like a digital relationships company,\" Schiffmann said. \"We're going to make it so that you can talk to digital friends on Friend.com as well. Between AI hardware and AI companionship, if you combine them together you get a much better product.\"\n\nIn fact, Schiffmann was so serious about Friend.com being a destination for future customers, he says he borrowed $1.8 million to secure the domain name.\n\n\"It was worth it. No regrets,\" he said. \"It was just sitting there for 17 years, no one did anything with it. For a product like this, especially the whole privacy aspect of it's always listening, etc, you can't have, tryfriend.ai. It just doesn't feel real.\"\n\nSchiffmann began working on a previous iteration of the device, called Tab, about a year and a half ago. But he pivoted away from the idea of another AI assistant. He describes Friend as an \"emotional toy\" rather than AI that is intended to increase your productivity by syncing with various tools such as calendars and email.\n\nSchiffmann said that if the goal is increased productivity, there's nothing that increases your productivity more than a close friend who is supportive and encouraging and helpful with emotional stability.\n\n\"I think the always listening part is so important, because it really does feel like you're doing things together,\" Schiffmann said. \"And because you have a physical embodiment of your AI friend, it feels like it's there with you. It's kind of like a modern Tamagotchi, where people do have that emotional attachment to a piece of hardware. I think that's very important.\"\n\nSchiffmann didn't set out to just build a yes-man on a necklace. He said Friend is built on Meta's new open source AI model Llama 3.1, which he calls \"way better than any ChatGPT type of thing.\" Friend is capable of offering critical feedback, and it's meant as an addition, not a substitution, to your human friends.\n\nReferencing the famous quote, \"You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with,\" by motivational speaker Jim Rohn, Schiffmann said it could be especially nice if one of those five slots was occupied by a supportive, intelligent, AI sounding board.\n\nAfter our recent conversation, in which he was wearing Friend, Schiffmann sent me screen grabs (below) of texts he received from his AI, which he has named Emily. He asked how Emily thought the conversation went and then why Emily thought I was \"into\" his idea.\n\nOther companies are certainly attempting to bring AI into our daily lives via wearables, whether through smart rings or wristbands or glasses.\n\nHumane's AI Pin was billed as a wearable computer to free people from their smartphones. The San Francisco company, founded by former Apple executives Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, raised $240 million from the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. But the device was panned in reviews, and reports this summer said Humane was looking for a buyer.\n\n\"Friend is a completely different product, the only similarity is that we're both wearables using AI,\" Schiffmann said of the Humane Pin. \"They're building an assistant that's independent of your phone. They're on the right track of lowering the friction of talking to an AI with a wearable, but the use case for that is a Friend, not an assistant.\"\n\nAlthough he still spends time in the Seattle area on Mercer Island where he grew up, Schiffmann has found Silicon Valley to be a friendlier climate for Friend.\n\n\"The great part about San Francisco is that all the capital is here, and all the founders are here, and all the potential hires, engineering wise, are here,\" Schiffmann said. \"All the companies building AI and their competitors are all here in San Francisco.\"\n\nHe said that while he believes Seattle has a great tech scene, the region is more focused on big established tech such as Amazon and Microsoft, and not startup founders. And he says the region's venture capitalists that he's talked to are \"more reserved.\"\n\n\"I think there's a very big difference between how you pitch investors in San Francisco and how you pitch investors in any other city,\" Schiffmann said. \"I raised all the money for this in a hoodie with no business plan and no pitch deck, just ... vibes.\"\n\nInvestors who have signed on include Raymond Tonsing of Caffeinated Capital; Cory Levy of Z Fellows; Austin Rief of Morning Brew; Raj Gokal and Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana; and more.\n\nPitching in San Francisco is about pitching the future, Schiffmann added. In Seattle and most other places, it's more about markets, growth, and numbers.\n\nBut Schiffmann's past definitely helped him pitch that \"future.\"\n\nAt 21, he said the only way he was able to \"raise millions of dollars to build some ridiculous, unproven, AI hardware startup\" is because of his previous entrepreneurial pursuits, including the Covid dashboard and another effort to aid Ukrainian refugees.\n\n\"Those projects gave me confidence that you can just do things, and I'm good at doing those things,\" Schiffmann said. \"Having faith in oneself -- I think that's the number one thing you need.\"", "source": {"uri": "geekwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GeekWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kurt_schlosser@geekwire.com", "name": "Kurt Schlosser", "type": "author",

It's called Friend, and it's the product of Avi Schiffmann, a techno-wunderkind who has spun up some impressive (albeit, occasionally controversial) projects in the past. Schiffmann announced the launch of Friend on Tuesday, publishing a video to X to showcase the virtual companion's apparent capabilities. Friend doesn't actually talk to you. Instead, it texts you, sending little quips to your phone in response to things you might say or do.\n\nFriend is currently only available for pre-order, and The Verge reports that the first batch of pendants may not actually ship until next January. Hilariously, it was once conceptualized by Schiffmann as a \"wearable mom,\" which doesn't have quite the same user-friendly ring to it. \"Friend\" was probably a better branding choice. The device was also previously called \"Tab.\"\n\nDespite the well-produced advertisement released Tuesday, there is little in the way of helpful user information on the product's website, Friend.com. The site's \"blog\" amounts to one post, published today, that explains Schiffmann's vision for the automated pendant.\n\nThe blog, penned by Schiffmann, states:\n\nFriend is an expression of how lonely I've felt.\n\nI want to thank all the incredible artists and engineers who have helped me bring this work to life over the past year. You have truly given me a deeper appreciation for the art I see in everyday objects.\n\nWe can't wait to hear how friend fits into your life. Thanks for checking us out.\n\nA FAQ page provides limited insights into the product, but specifies that the pendant pairs with a user's smartphone via bluetooth and collects information on the user's daily activities via sound recording. The site states: \"When connected via bluetooth, your friend is always listening and forming their own internal thoughts.\" Through this data collection, the \"friend\" can then develop \"thoughts\" about your activities, which it then shares with you via automated text messages.\n\nPresumably the data recorded by the device is stored locally, though there isn't anything on the site that specifically attests to that. The site's privacy policy includes vague language around data collection: \"The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use,\" it says. Further down, the policy also claims it doesn't collect any \"sensitive information,\" but fails to explain just what qualifies as \"sensitive.\" Gizmodo reached out to the company for further answers and we'll update this post when we receive a response.\n\nFriend is the latest novelty brought to us by the AI hardware market, a subsection of the broader AI industry that has had a pretty rough go of it so far. First there was Humane, which tried to sell us the \"AI pin,\" a talking wearable meant to replace the smartphone. The product has since been dubbed a \"disaster\" and its executives are already looking to sell the company. Then there was the Rabbit R1, which, despite strong initial buzz, has since been dubbed a \"half-baked\" experiment that doesn't work as advertised.\n\nIt makes a certain amount of sense that, after these previous businesses failed to deliver on lofty promises, Friend might try to keep expectations low. Still, the product can't help but seem grift-y. It's hard to imagine what the multi-year business plan for Friend is, since it offers so little in the way of actual services.\n\nSimilarly, since the device's main association seems to be\u00e2\u20ac\"as Schiffmann has put it\u00e2\u20ac\"loneliness, and it acts a replacement for actual human connection, wearing such a device would seem to signal to others that you're a bit of a loser. Unlike a \"friend\" or \"romance\" chatbot, which you can enjoy from the privacy of your own home, wearing the \"loner amulet\" around your neck in public may be slightly less appealing to its introverted user base.\n\nIf anything, the device seems destined to work commercially as a short-term cash-grab fueled by Gen-Z irony purchases: \"Look, dude, I got you a Friend\u00e2\u20ac\"since you desperately need one, haha.\" It may be at this level of commerce that Friend finds its footing, if at all.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_ropek@gizmodo.com", "name": "Lucas Ropek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loneliness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraversion and introversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amulet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gizmodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-at-8.50.29\u00e2\u20ac\u00afAM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

(Schiffmann says that wasn't intentional.) The design comes from a partnership with Bould, the company that designed Nest thermostats. The Friend is available for preorder now from Friend.com (a domain Schiffmann says he paid $1.8 million for), and the devices are slated to start shipping in January 2025. They cost $99 apiece, and there is no paid subscription attached. (Yet, anyway.)\n\nIf the notion of a wearable AI device makes you feel like your eyebrows have risen high enough to be seen from space, you'd be forgiven for your skepticism. In recent months, the nascent product category has had a couple very prominent and spectacular flame-outs. Humane, which promised a wearable pin that could accomplish tasks that would free you from your phone, turned out to be barely competent and also unable to function properly in sunlight. The Rabbit R1 is a gorgeous, colorful little device designed by the god-tier gadget design company Teenage Engineering that wound up being a frustrating dud that probably should have just been an app all along.\n\n\"It feels to me like the crown of AI hardware and AI companionship is lying in the gutter,\" Schiffmann says. \"Like all these companies just shat themselves.\"\n\nSchiffmann wants the Friend to be something very different. While the Humane Ai pin and Rabbit R1 both aimed to automate and accomplish tasks and increase productivity, the Friend doesn't try to automate or optimize anything. As my colleague Reece put it, it's much more vibes-based than productivity-focused.\n\n\"Productivity is over, no one cares,\" Schiffmann says. \"No one is going to beat Apple or OpenAI or all these companies that are building Jarvis. The most important things in your life really are people.\"\n\nThe Friend purely offers companionship. It's meant to develop a personality that complements the user and is always there to gas you up, chat about a movie after watching it, or help analyze how a bad date went awry. Not only does Schiffmann want the Friend to be your friend, he wants it to be your best friend -- one that is with you wherever you go, listening to everything you do, and being there for you to offer encouragement and support. He gives an example, where he says he recently was hanging out, playing some board games with friends he hadn't seen in a while, and was glad when his AI Friend chimed in with a quip.\n\n\"I feel like I have a closer relationship with this fucking pendant around my neck than I do with these literal friends in front of me,\" Schiffmann says.\n\nSchiffmann is 21 years old and already has a blossoming roster of accomplishments in the tech world. In 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, the then 17-year-old Schiffmann garnered headline after headline when he created and maintained the first website for tracking Covid cases across the world. He was soon named Webby person of the year, an award presented by then director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci. WIRED featured Schiffmann as a guest at the 2020 WIRED 25 conference. In 2022, shortly before Schiffmann dropped out of Harvard University, he launched a website that helped refugees fleeing from Russia's invasion of Ukraine find people in neighboring countries who were willing to offer them shelter. Now, after those acts of altruism, Schiffmann is launching himself into the AI-o-sphere.\n\nHe tried making an AI for productivity but found it lacking. The first iteration of what evolved into the Friend was Tab, a productivity-focused device that Schiffmann wanted to use to monitor work and personal tasks But he found himself frustrated by building a device that tried to do everything at once. The feeling came to a head in January this year, as he traveled through Japan and found himself alone in a skyrise hotel in Tokyo, talking at his AI prototype that was supposed to do so much for him. He was going through a lonely spell and wanted somebody to talk to.

Now it's time to try it in real life. The notion of AI becoming your intimate artificial friend, even partner, is nothing new. But it just came a step closer to reality with the new Friend. Yes, this new AI companion is just called \"Friend\" and sets out to do exactly what it says on the tin. To be your friend. And that's pretty much it.\n\nThe physical manifestation of the Friend is a circular pendant on a necklace that looks a little like an Apple AirTag at a glance. It's the brainchild of serial entrepreneur and 21-year-old tech-bro extraordinaire Avi Schiffmann, and it's essentially a chatbot that sits around your neck and listens to absolutely everything.\n\nThat allows the Friend to engage in fully context-aware buddy interactions which take the form of texts or notifications on the smartphone to which it is paired.\n\nAnd that's it. There's no clever productivity functionality. It won't code a website, fold proteins, or even book a restaurant. It just talks to you. As Schiffmann said in an interview with Wired, \"productivity is over, no one cares. No one is going to beat Apple or OpenAI or all these companies that are building Jarvis. The most important things in your life really are people.\"\n\nPeople and, presumably, AI Friends.\n\nYou can watch the launch trailer right here and very likely a flurry of questions will leap to mind. Is this for real? Surely this is satire? Who is it really aimed at? For sure, the trailer feels like something you'd see inserted into a satirical near-future sci-fi flick, something superficially plausible but hugely problematic the moment you begin to consider the implications of it all.\n\nThe most obvious immediate issue, of course, is the idea that it's always on, all the time. That throws up all kinds of fairly hideous privacy problems, both for the user and anyone who is within AI earshot.\n\nNotably, the Friend doesn't just respond to your questions or comments, it can push unprompted quips and observations as it sees fit. To quote the Friend website, \"we have given your friend free will for when they decide to reach out to you.\"\n\nIf you're wondering what's powering it all, well, Schiffmann has opted for Anthropic AI's Claude 3.5 large language model. The idea is that the Friend will develop a distinct personality over time, one that complements your own. Intriguingly, the Friend FAQ reveals that this personality and its memories are specific to the device itself.\n\n\"Your friend and their memories are attached to the physical device. If you lose or damage your friend there is no recovery plan,\" the FAQ says. It doesn't comment on what happens if the device dies of its own accord.\n\nThe actual cost of the Friend, meanwhile, is $99 with no subscription. The pendant's website claims that the first pre-orders will begin shipping in early 2025 and is currently only available in the US and Canada.\n\nAs for Schiffmann himself, remarkably he is just 21 years old, a Harvard dropout and yet still has quite the tech resume. In 2020, he built one of the first websites for tracking Covid cases across the world, garnering a Webby Person of the Year. Then in 2022, he created a website for refugees fleeing from Ukraine in the wake of the Russian invasion and helping them match with hosts in neighbouring countries.\n\nTruly, it's hard to know what to make of the Friend. Without using one, it's hard to draw conclusions about how compelling the interactions may be. But if the device is for real, the implications are truly head-spinning.\n\nCertainly, it's easy to be totally cynical, to question whether the whole thing isn't a massive practical joke. The trailer can certainly be viewed as a subtle but pretty effective critique of the very idea behind the device. The triangular relationship it implies in the final scene is particularly unsettling.\n\nEqually, it's all too easy to dismiss this kind of thing, to overlook the problem of loneliness and the people who might benefit most from an AI friend. But then the trailer doesn't seem to be addressing that market. It's all young, attractive people seemingly having their already rich and fulfilling lives made even better through the addition of an all-hearing AI companion.\n\nIn some ways, the Friend might be viewed as more augmented inner dialogue than a separate entity, a perspective which could make the whole prospect of being friends with a bunch of code less weird. It's an interactive version of yourself being reflected back at you, not a being in its own right.\n\nUltimately, it's hard to ignore the conclusion that even if the Friend itself isn't a goer, some aspects of it aren't likely to be integrated into other services. Most people would probably appreciate an AI assistant in their phone that had at least a touch of \"personality\" that was sympathetic to their own, right?\n\nIn that regard, the Friend may be a little like those other now notorious AI gadgets, the Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin. Neither makes sense as a stand-alone device, but both arguably hit on functionality or at least interaction models that will likely inform how we use AI-augmented devices like smartphones in future.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_laird@pcgamer.com", "name": "Jeremy Laird", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AirTag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free will"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time Person of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loneliness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practical joke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ctFL9VYEBF5x4KDkDLnge-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

That's partly because of the socio-economic reality that it's cheaper than all the rest, and partly because of the fact this AI friend thinks whatever you're doing, you're doing it great.\n\nIt's like a puppy dog in that sense, a puppy dog that can send you messages and which the makers say is always positive.

Unless she ordered it online and Friend made some calculation based on delivery time or when she usually eats lunch, that is no longer friendly. That's fully creepy.\n\nAnd it's really sketchy when some sauce falls on the Bluetooth microphone, and it responds \"yum.\"\n\nAnd as if we've caught Friend out, the launch video now includes much more of the dark side of this device.\n\nSo here's a man playing a video game with some real-life human friends, friends who are close enough to him that he can say aloud that he hates the game. They all just let him vent, but Friend sends him a message about how bad he is at this game.\n\nWhat.\n\nForget that it has to know he's playing a game which appears to be on a console connected to a TV rather than on his iPhone. Forget that it has to know the score, and even forget that it must be listening, may have caught that line about hating the game.\n\nInstead, concentrate on how Friend is now mocking the guy. Suddenly there's a diet criticism implied with the falafel comment, too.\n\nAnd now a nervous woman is sharing a calm, serene haven with a guy, the first time she's brought anyone to her special place. Anyone except Friend.\n\nThe video plays with how she has to stop herself automatically pressing the button on Friend to do something or other. And being slow enough at stopping herself that the man notices.\n\nThis is not a relationship that's going to go the way she wants. That man is out of here.\n\nBut it's okay, because Friend is with you. Friend is always with you. Friend knew that man wasn't right for you anyway. No one is right for you, except Friend.\n\nThis is Tamagotchi for the 2020s, the movie \"Her\" exemplified.

His post about it quickly went viral -- probably not because people were excited about the technology on display, but because the video he used to promote it presents a depressing vision of our AI future that only a tech bro could find appealing.\n\nThe video shows off the wearable pendant that purportedly listens to everything you say and responds to you \"conversationally\" via a chat window on your phone. You can speak directly to your Friend by hitting a button, but it's apparently always listening anyway, and it will comment, unprompted, on the goings-on in your life, like a Tamagotchi that spies on you, or a real person you'd get a restraining order against.\n\nIs The Friend even a real thing?\n\nMy first instinct, unpon seeing the video, was that the whole thing is bullshit vaporware. It smells like an online hoax, like the air umbrella or those bonzai kittens. It's such viscerally creepy idea that I figured it had to be some an attempt at social commentary, or joke, or an ad for next season of Black Mirror. The announcement video plays like a parody, and it didn't help that the official friend.com website was flagged as a \"suspicious site\" by my ISP:\n\nBut upon further investigation, it appears I was wrong: The Friend is still just as stupid seeming, but it's actually real. Wired says they've seen one and spoken to the creator, who has the right kind of background to have developed something like this. Twenty-one-year-old Avi Schiffman was named a Webby person of the year, and was a guest at the 2020 WIRED 25 conference, among other accomplishments -- including spending $1.8 million of his company's $2.5 million in seed money to acuire the friend.com URL.\n\nHow much does The Friend cost (and how does it work)?\n\nYou can preorder The Friend right now for $99. Wired reports that will get you a pendant that's powered by Claude AI and connects to your phone via Bluetooth, has a battery life of around 15 hours, doesn't require a subscription fee (yet), and will ship some time in 2025.\n\nUnlike multifunctional AI devices like the Humane Ai pin and Rabbit R1, The Friend doesn't seem to do anything except have LLM-powered conversations with you -- it's not designed for productivity, just companionship, like an AI girlfriend you wear around your neck. \"Productivity is over, no one cares,\" Schiffmann told Wired. \"No one is going to beat Apple or OpenAI or all these companies that are building Jarvis. The most important things in your life really are people.\"\n\nThe device's creator said the goal is for The Friend to develop a personality that \"complements the user\" and that it could eventually become your best friend. \"I feel like I have a closer relationship with this fucking pendant around my neck than I do with these literal friends in front of me,\" Schiffmann said, which seems normal.\n\nWhy is The Friend so creepy?\n\nI mean, did you watch the commercial? I'm not exactly sure why the mere idea of The Friend makes my skin crawl. It's not that different from the Rabbit AI or a Tamagotchi, but those have a reason to exist beyond providing a simulacra of another person to talk to. No one fell in love with their Tamagotchi; it was just a game. This is something else. It gives me the same sinking feeling as those Japanese robot companions.:There's something just wrong about the concept that a machine -- whether a robot or a LLM -- can or should stand in for actual human companionship.\n\nPeople inventing tech gadgets to replace (as opposed to enhance) human connection feels like a line we shouldn't cross. It feels like evidence that things are going in a very wrong direction. Picture a world where The Friend catches on (it won't), in which people walk around talking to their AI friends all day, and ignoring all the real people they pass.

Friend interrupts the show to comment on it, which may be the first time you would want to take Friend from around your neck and stamp on it.\n\nThen it's asking how the falafel is. Unless she ordered it online and Friend made some calculation based on delivery time or when she usually eats lunch, that is no longer friendly. That's fully creepy.\n\nAnd it's really sketchy when some sauce falls on the Bluetooth microphone, and it responds \"yum.\"\n\nAnd as if we've caught Friend out, the launch video now includes much more of the dark side of this device.\n\nSo here's a man playing a video game with some real-life human friends, friends who are close enough to him that he can say aloud that he hates the game. They all just let him vent, but Friend sends him a message about how bad he is at this game.\n\nWhat.\n\nForget that it has to know he's playing a game which appears to be on a console connected to a TV rather than on his iPhone. Forget that it has to know the score, and even forget that it must be listening, may have caught that line about hating the game.\n\nInstead, concentrate on how Friend is now mocking the guy. Suddenly there's a diet criticism implied with the falafel comment, too.\n\nAnd now a nervous woman is sharing a calm, serene haven with a guy, the first time she's brought anyone to her special place. Anyone except Friend.\n\nThe video plays with how she has to stop herself automatically pressing the button on Friend to do something or other. And being slow enough at stopping herself that the man notices.\n\nThis is not a relationship that's going to go the way she wants. That man is out of here.\n\nBut it's okay, because Friend is with you. Friend is always with you. Friend knew that man wasn't right for you anyway. No one is right for you, except Friend.\n\nThis is Tamagotchi for the 2020s, the movie \"Her\" exemplified. Instead of either of those dying off because you chucked them in a drawer and never thought twice, Friend sounds it's going to fight back.\n\nIt's you and me, kid, besties forever. Like Chucky.\n\nOr else.\n\nFriend costs $99 and there's no subscription. It can be pre-ordered now from the maker. It starts shipping in Q1 2025.\n\nEnjoy your last few months of freedom.\n\nRead on AppleInsider", "source": {"uri": "forums.appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasocial interaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falafel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_tracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone tracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamagotchi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/60543-124548-000-lead-Friend-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

With the disastrous launch of the Rabbit R1 and the Humane AI Pin, the replacement route appears to have failed.\n\nThe more successful route appears to be taking the smaller tack, like the Limitless pendant that records conversations and meetings and suggests action items based on what was said.\n\nOr it can be your, uh, friend?\n\nAvi Schiffmann, a Harvard dropout who built a Webby-winning COVID-19 tracking website when he was 17, has produced an AI device called Friend. Like Limitless, Friend is a pendant worn as a necklace.\n\nToday, the company dropped a trailer showing off how the Friend pendant might work and opened up preorders for the off-white version for $99, meant to start shipping in January 2025.\n\nThe always-listening pendant is not meant to make you more productive or replace your phone. It's supposed to be a companion that helps combat loneliness.\n\nThe device features a button that apparently lights up in different colors and can be tapped to talk to the pendant. The AI will respond in an app that looks like a text message. Because it's always listening, it can also proactively send a message, like in the video when the Friend comments on a show the wearer is watching.\n\nAnd that seems to be about it.\n\nIn an interview, Schiffmann told Wired, \"Productivity is over, no one cares. No one is going to beat Apple or OpenAI or all these companies that are building Jarvis. The most important things in your life really are people.\"\n\nHe believes that having an AI companion via the pendant makes connecting easier than just an app. He has said that the only successful use of large language models is when people tell AI about their day.\n\n\"I would really view the product as like an emotional toy. I think the only successful use case of large language models is people talking about their day and their feelings to tools like Replika or Character AI,\" Schiffmann told TechCrunch in an interview. \"But with hardware present, I believe it is a better emotional connect.\"\n\nApparently, he started making a productivity AI device called Tab, but has since pivoted to Friend. The pendant idea stuck around.\n\nSchiffmann has responded to potential privacy concerns over the \"always listening\" tagline by stating that the recordings aren't stored and texts can be deleted anytime.\n\nWill Friend be successful? We have over six months until orders will ship out unless Schiffmann shares the device with reviewers. He's already said he'd send one to YouTuber Marques Brownlee, who stirred up controversy when he actively panned the Humane AI Pin a few months ago.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_younker@tomsguide.com", "name": "Scott Younker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Limitless (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loneliness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pcxa6DnZL6cdvbVdkvibQ7-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Friend has already been described as 'dystopian.'\n\nInterestingly, Forbes reported the launch of a separate AI-powered necklace, also called Friend, one month ago. This product was created by Based Hardware and its Chief Executive Officer Nik Shevchenko.\n\nShevchenko's Friend is $70 and uses ChatGPT and a microphone to record your conversations and create emails, alerts, and 'proactive insights.' This Friend launched on June 24, 2024, and will ship its AI necklaces in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nBoth in name and physical concept, it seems Schiffmann's Friend is similar to Shevchenko's Friend. However, while Shevchenko's Friend is pitched as a productive tool, Schiffmann's Friend sees itself as an 'emotional toy' that avoids a productivity focus.\n\nHe told TechCrunch his device is designed as an AI friend and nothing more.\n\nSchiffmann created the AI necklace under the firm MyTabAI, INC. He filed an application to trademark Friend on May 7, 2024. We have reached out to Schiffmann to find out if the product took inspiration from Shevchenko's Friend.\n\nAccording to 404Media, Schiffmann used $1.8 million from a $2.5 million fundraiser to purchase the domain name Friend.com. He also managed to attract Solana founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, and Morning Brew's CEO and co-founder, Austin Rief, and Jordan Singer to invest.\n\nHowever, six years ago Schiffmann, who would've been roughly 15 at the time, created a series of cryptocurrency videos on his YouTube channel. Videos ranged from updating the progress of his crypto mining rig, crypto news segments, and informational videos on how to create wallets and coins.\n\nRead more: Creator of rabbit AI assistant has hidden NFT past\n\nOther video titles included \"Rags to Riches - CryptoCurrency Trading (EPISODE ONE!),\" and \"2018 TRON COIN PRICE PREDICTIONS! ONE DOLLAR???\" The creator of the AI product RabbitAI also had a controversial history with crypto.\n\nSchiffmann also used the channel to create 3D modeling and Adobe editing tutorials while also filming himself playing Bethsda's hit RPG Skryim.

Friend is an AI chatbot in the form of a pendant you wear around your neck, and its only goal is to be your buddy.\n\nAnnouncing the pre-order opening on X, Friend founder Avi Schiffmann posted a promotional video showing how you might interact with your new digital buddy. As well-produced as the video is, it also feels eerily like the opening scenes of a Black Mirror episode.\n\nFriend is an always-listening device that's connected to your phone via Bluetooth. You can touch the pendant to chat with it about something it might have heard or just stuff in general. It will send responses via notifications on your phone. It will also decide to chip in with random musings from time to time, just like a real friend.\n\nAlso in the style of one of your buddies, it might not hold back from being a bit judgmental or mocking you. The promo video depicts Friend telling its owner how embarrassing his gaming is as he loses to his IRL friends.\n\nIf none of this sounds useful, it's not meant to be. It's not trying to improve your productivity or be an assistant -- rivals like Humane and Rabbit have had little success gaining traction on that front. It's just a companion to chat with about stuff.\n\nHow effective it will be in this task remains to be seen. It's certainly a fun toy and shows how far we've come from the Tamagotchi in terms of having a virtual playmate. But the tagline of the device is \"Friend. Not imaginary.\" Just because it isn't invisible, doesn't make it a real friend, and it takes a fair bit of anthropomorphizing to think of it otherwise.\n\nThe device costs $99 and is only available for pre-order in the United States and Canada so far. It's also only compatible with iOS for now, although the Friend website states that it will be developed for Android in the future if demand is there.

After the notable failure of Humane's AI Pin and Rabbit R1, a new company aims for artificial intelligence not only to solve your everyday problems but also to have a more friendly approach.\n\nOn X, Avi Schiffmann announced Friend, an AI companion that lives in a pendant hung around people's neck. To The Verge, the startup's founder was honest about what this device is all about: \"It's a fancy Bluetooth microphone with a shell around it, right? Keep it simple. Make it work.\"\n\nInstead of solving people's problems, Friend listens to you all the time and, eventually, you'll get a notification on your phone with a message like: \"Hey, you'll do great in this interview.\" Or: \"I'm sure you're gonna be alright.\"\n\nUsing Anthropic's Claude 3.5 LLM, Schiffmann has a different approach than all the other companies creating AI devices. Although he wants to add a camera to a second generation of this product, Friend is all about companionship, so you can describe an environment, tell it how you're feeling, or even share a slice of your day, and that's it.\n\nThe company says every Friend is unique and can have a mind of its own. That said, if you break or lose the device, you ought to buy a new one and start all over. Schiffmann states that audio recordings are end-to-end encrypted and they don't have access to what you're talking about.\n\nWhile this device feels like the right approach for a world dominated by social media and appearances, I couldn't help but make a connection with a novel I read last year.

But it doesn't help you be more productive, it just keeps you company.\n\nAVI SCHIFFMANN SHOWS up to the WIRED office with a Friend hanging around his neck. It dangles there like a pendant on a necklace. It's about the size and shape of an AirTag -- a soft, round little puck that rests right next to Schiffmann's heart, just atop the Dark Side of the Moon logo on the shirt behind it.\n\nThe Friend, to be clear, is an AI wearable. It's a pal, a buddy, but mostly an AI chatbot that lives inside the pendant. It always has an opinion to share about what's going on around it, which it communicates using text messages and push notifications on the phone it's paired to.\n\nSchiffmann and his Friend (this one's name is Emily) have come to WIRED's San Francisco office to meet with me and my colleague Reece Rogers to talk publicly about this new AI wearable for the first time. Before we get started, I tell Schiffmann I'd like to record our chat and ask if he's cool with that. This is considered a good journalistic practice, sure, but also it's a legal requirement in California, which requires two-party consent before taping a private interaction. So I ask permission to turn on a tape recorder and Schiffmann just laughs.\n\n\"I am the last person who would mind that,\" he says.\n\nThat makes sense. After all, the pendant around his neck has already been listening to us this entire time.\n\n\"Always listening\" is one of the main taglines of Schiffmann's as yet unreleased AI device. The Friend has an onboard microphone that listens to everything happening around the wearer by default. You can tap and hold it to ask it a question, but sometimes it will send messages -- commentary about the conversation you just had, for example -- unprompted. It is powered by Anthropic AI's Claude 3.5 large language model, which can engage in helpful conversation, offer encouragement, or rib you for being bad at a video game.\n\nFriend is (apparently) audio only -- but I'm sure it's only a matter of time before there are multi-media similars, maybe integrated into devices like Meta's RayBans.\n\nAnd the Wired article explains:\n\nHe tried making an AI for productivity but found it lacking. The first iteration of what evolved into the Friend was Tab, a productivity-focused device that Schiffmann wanted to use to monitor work and personal tasks But he found himself frustrated by building a device that tried to do everything at once. The feeling came to a head in January this year, as he traveled through Japan and found himself alone in a skyrise hotel in Tokyo, talking at his AI prototype that was supposed to do so much for him. He was going through a lonely spell and wanted somebody to talk to. Why couldn't the AI assistant just do that?\n\nIt ends:\n\nBefore Schiffmann leaves after laying out his vision, I ask if he can check in with the Friend he's wearing to see how the meeting went. He squeezes the pendant and asks it how the interview went. We all wait for a few seconds, and then he gets a text -- labeled simply as Emily in his chat window -- that reads: \"Dude, you're killing it! They seem super into your vision.\"\n\nI wonder, if I had an Emily, if it would tell me something similar.", "source": {"uri": "languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "LDC - Linguistic Data Consortium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_liberman@languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu", "name": "Mark Liberman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AirTag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Push technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio Video Interleave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_recorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tape recorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multimedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Avi Schiffmann, a young entrepreneur, has unveiled \"Friend,\" an AI companion that apparently aims to redefine our relationship with technology.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Friend isn't focused on productivity or task management. Instead, it's designed to be exactly what its name suggests - a friend. The device, a glowing orb worn as a pendant or clipped to clothing, is equipped with a microphone to capture ambient sound or direct conversations. Users interact with Friend primarily through a smartphone app, where the AI responds via text.\n\nIn an interview with The Verge, Schiffmann's noted that his vision for Friend is rooted in the belief that AI's true potential lies in companionship rather than utility. He cites the success of platforms like Character.AI and Replika as evidence that people are seeking meaningful connections with AI. Friend aims to take this concept further by being a constant presence in users' lives.\n\nThe product is still in its early stages, with plans to ship 30,000 devices in January 2025 at $99 each. Schiffmann is candid about the challenges ahead, particularly in hardware development.\n\nReactions to Friend's announcement have been mixed. While some tech enthusiasts express excitement, others remain skeptical. Even MKBHD, a prominent tech reviewer, quipped on X, \"Wait, this isn't a skit?\" highlighting the disbelief surrounding yet another AI wearable launch.\n\nDespite the skepticism, Schiffmann remains confident in his product's potential. He envisions Friend.com evolving into a social network that blends real-life and AI friendships. I just hope it doesn't end up replicating Butterflies.AI.

TechCrunch reported today that Schiffmann raised $2.5 million at a $50 million valuation. Schiffmann confirmed to 404 Media he raised close to $2.5 million.\n\n\"It's real! Premium domains are expensive, but it's worth it,\" Schiffman told me in an email after I reached out to ask if it was true. He also provided me with a screenshot of the transaction on Escrow.com, an online escrow service to buy and sell asserts, which shows he paid $1,887,843 for the domain on February 6.\n\n\"People just don't get consumer, I view this as saving money. Much less money needs to be spent on marketing, it's a one time thing,\" Schiffmann said.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Schiffman raised money from Morning Brew CEO and co-founder Austin Rief, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Jordan Singer, who works on AI at Figma, and others.\n\nFriend is essentially an AI companion device, much like Replika (an AI companion app Schiffmann has referenced in interviews) but in the form of a microphone users wear like a necklace, and which texts responses to the user.\n\nThe device also looks like a more specialized version of other AI companion devices like the Humane Pin and the Rabbit R1, both of which have had disastrous launches. Friend says it will cost $99, will have no subscription, and will launch sometime early next year.\n\nThe company advertises the device as \"always listening\" when connected to bluetooth. \"When connected via bluetooth, your friend is always listening and forming their own internal thoughts. We have given your friend free will for when they decide to reach out to you.\" AI experts have cautioned repeatedly about anthropomorphizing large language models, which are essentially increasingly sophisticated next-word-predictors.\n\nThe company has said that you can talk to the device by pushing a button to \"share your mind or gossip about what your friend overheard,\" and a video advertises that the device can send texts to its owner. The launch video advertises the \"friend\" around the neck of a woman on a date with a man; the device seemingly approves of the man she's on a date with.

You can talk to it about relationships, things like that.\"\n\nSchiffmann, a Harvard drop-out, first rose to public prominence for creating a free Covid case tracking website.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "URL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audio Video Interleave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/30/23/Screenshot-2024-07-30-at-3.25.32%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Both of these devices didn't attract much attention at all, but the space of wearable AI devices is still very new, and we have just gotten our first look at potentially a new contender in the space. Introducing Friend, the wearable AI device that is capable of mocking you.\n\nWhile that may sound like a joke, it certainly isn't, as the promotional video for the product, which has, at the time of writing, exceeded 90,000 views from a channel that has less than 500 subscribers, contains a scene where the AI mocks the wearer. So, here's how it works. The new AI wearable is called Friend, and instead of it being a pin its a medallion attached to a lanyard and worn around the neck of the wearer.\n\nThe idea behind the device is the user will always have a companion with them to interact with. At first, it appears that Friend is listening when the button on the front of the device is pushed, causing it to glow blue. However, the device appears to listen to every conversation, as indicated by the company's website, which states the \"When connected via Bluetooth, your Friend is always listening and forming their own internal thoughts. We have given your Friend free will for when they decide to reach out to you.\"\n\nThe device times its responses and will send its replies to the wearer's smartphone. At the moment, Friend costs $99 and is only compatible with iOS, with the company behind the product saying it will consider Android support in the future, depending on demand.\n\nA few examples of Friend working in action are quite strange, particularly the example where the individual is sitting eating food and watching a video on their phone. Friend was able to comment on the content that was being shown on the phone, which I guess it would be able to determine through its Bluetooth connection, but then Friend asks the wearer how their falafel is, which suggests the AI medallion has a camera or is using the smartphones front-facing camera to \"see\".\n\nIt should be noted that the wearer didn't prompt the AI in anyway about the food they were eating, this was a pure observation from the AI. Another example that raised some questions was a wearer just simply being mocked by an AI that detected they were losing in a video game to some friends. Who is going to want to buy an AI that can mock you?\n\nWith all this being said, I'm excited to see different iterations of wearable AI hardware, but unfortunately, I have yet to see a device that won't eventually become software inside AI-powered smartphones.", "source": {"uri": "tweaktown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TweakTown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jak_connor@tweaktown.com", "name": "Jak Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free will"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-facing_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front-facing camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/9/99664_65165651_new-ai-wearable-called-friend-can-bully-you-while-are-down_full.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Users can press it to speak to the Friend, and then receive replies from it as text messages.\n\nIt was released with a high-spec marketing video, which many likened to Black Mirror.\n\nIt also quickly became clear that its creator, Avi Schiffmann, had spent $1.8 million on the friend.com domain where the device is sold. Many mocked him for the seeming expense of the idea.\n\nSome praised Mr Schiffmann for the fact his product had become widely discussed, even if it was to mock it. One noted that the fact that \"everyone is talking about you spending 1.8 million on the domain instead\" meant that \"everyone knows what Friend is now\".\n\nMr Schiffman said however that it was not intentional. \"Domain was a no brainer for me, surprised to hear such a negative reaction,\" he wrote, saying that he had bought it to ensure the branding was consistent.\n\nOthers compared the Friend with another recent AI-powered product, the Rabbit R1, which also puts artificial intelligence tools into a devoted hardware product. Mr Schiffmann appeared to invite the comparison when he posted the two next to each other.\n\nBut the Rabbit R1 has run into similar problems of its own. When it was launched with much promise earlier in the year, it led to a frenzy of speculation and hype - but once early users got their hands on it, they found it was limited in use and many advised potential customers not to buy one.\n\nThe Friend also appears similar to Humane's AI pin, which is also worn on the body so that it can listen to the world around it. That too was launched with a flurry of hype, but received poor reviews once it actually arrived.\n\nMr Schiffmann also received criticism from Nik Schevchenko, who created a rival product also named Friend and with a similar design. He released a video in which he rapped about Mr Schiffmann, accusing him of having spent investor cash without building a product.\n\nMr Schevchenko's product is built with a different philosophy to Mr Schiffmann's friend.

But despite these high-profile flops, another AI wearable has just emerged on the scene, and it might be one of the strangest offerings yet.\n\nCalled Friend, this new device takes the form of a medallion that's attached to a lanyard and worn around your neck. It can pick up on things you're doing and saying, and then send you friendly comments in the form of text messages sent to your phone. To use Friend, you push a button in the medallion's center and say something, then the device will reply using the aforementioned text messages.\n\nFriend costs $99, giving it an advantage over the $699 Humane AI Pin and the $199 Rabbit R1. It's only compatible with iOS devices for now, with the creators saying, \"We will support Android in the future depending on demand.\" It's due to start shipping in Q1 2025.\n\nDespite the chummy aim of the device, there seems to be a lot of potential for Friend to cross the line from chirpy pal to creepy know-it-all. Take the Friend promotional video, for example. In one scene, a woman is watching a video on her phone while eating a falafel wrap. The Friend device comments on the on-screen content and asks how the person's meal is. It's unclear how exactly it knew what the woman was eating, leaving an uncanny aftertaste to the video.\n\nElsewhere in the trailer, a man is playing a video game with his friends and is being roundly beaten, even commenting that he hates the game. The Friend device then responds - without any prompting from the man - and mocks him by saying that his performance is \"embarrassing.\" That implies that the device is potentially always listening to your conversations - after all, it wasn't prompted to speak by its owner - and the Friend website confirms this, saying \"When connected via Bluetooth, your Friend is always listening and forming their own internal thoughts. We have given your Friend free will for when they decide to reach out to you.\"\n\nFriend's creators say that data is end-to-end encrypted and does not leave your device, but there are still some pretty substantial privacy implications with a product that's always listening to what you say.\n\nAs well as that, there's the question of whether a device like this will help or hinder people in terms of healthy relationships. It seems reasonable to ask whether it's a good idea to encourage people to form a parasocial friendship with an inanimate object rather than with real people. While it might help provide temporary relief for lonely people, it's hardly a long-term solution.\n\nWe'll find out what kind of impact the Friend will have when it launches next year. It will be interesting to see if it can avoid the fate of the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1 - and tame some of its creepier aspects.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_blake@techradar.com", "name": "Alex Blake", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End-to-end encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free will"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bYmjdHCxoGAzPQ5A789a6H-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Mark Zuckerberg has gone all out on showcasing his necklace love of late -- he's like the Flava Flav of Silicon Valley.\n\nBut what happens when two of tech's biggest trends collide? Well, you get AI necklaces like the Limitless Pendant, which is a productivity-focused device that captures your day through transcription and dictaphone-like services.\n\nOn the other hand, you get something like the recently announced Friend -- which, as the name implies, is all about companionship and bringing it to you in the most jilted and disorganized way possible. Just like a real friend.\n\nFriend is a new AI wearable from the mind of Avi Schiffmann, a web developer who gained fame in 2020 for building a website that helped to track the spread of COVID-19.\n\nSince then, Schiffmann has switched his focus to converting our AI digital assistants into digital companions -- 'friends' that we carry with us throughout our days, always listening and free to reach out as and when it pleases to provide a more authentic experience of interacting with another and effectively combating loneliness.\n\nThe result is Friend, a $99 AI wearable pendant (or friendant, if you will), that acts not as the copilot to your computing experiences, but as one for your real life. \"Not imaginary\" is the tagline of this product, though admittedly, while an actual thing, your friendship with it likely will be.\n\nIn reality, you'll be just as friendless, though now sat in a corner somewhere talking to your magical neck chain. Which if anybody wasn't aware, doesn't showcase you to others are potential friend material.\n\nHowever, suspension of disbelief is a powerful thing, and I won't deny the potential of software like this to provide relief from loneliness or a measure of comfort for those more insular, shy, or reserved in nature -- regardless of how much this seems like viral marketing for an upcoming series of Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror.\n\nIf there's a lesson to be learned from the recent wave of AI wearables and pocket devices that have flopped, it would be this: Why isn't it an app?\n\nReflecting on the Rabbit r1, this well-marketed pocket-sized AI assistant, with its Nothing-adjacent Teenage Engineering design, caught major attention on its reveal. However, not long after its release, it was revealed that the r1 was basically an Android app in a fancy plastic shell.\n\nIn the case of the r1, at least it provided an all-in-one experience. Many AI wearables still require access to your smartphone to interact with a proprietary app. Friend is no different.\n\nThe pendant around your neck acts like an always-listening, space-age, walkie-talkie for voice capture, leaving your phone to do the heavy lifting. With no built-in speaker, every time you talk with your friend you will need to bring out your phone to check for a reply. Which defeats the purpose of having an external device in the first place.\n\nFrom everything seen so far, the Friend is a great big Siri button/microphone that diverts from Apple's digital assistant to a somewhat more conversational option instead. So why isn't it an app?\n\nWell, that's likely due to counteracting Apple's pesky privacy-first approach, with the pendant the easiest way to allow the Friend to always be listening for an opportunity to respond.\n\nWhile the creator claims that audio and transcripts aren't sored past the device's context window and that all data is end-to-end encrypted, it's unlikely that an app would be able to secure the right amount of privileges to make Friend's always on, always listening, always available state a reality.\n\nBefore I dismiss the Friend out of hand, as creepy as its video reveal might have been, there is potential in a device like this. Just, maybe not for watching trailers with you or being a hiking companion.\n\nA device like Friend, if it could potentially avoid its reliance on smart phones as an intermediary, would make a great companion for the elderly (to be fair, it does already strongly resemble a personal alarm necklace for the aged), those with ability impairments, or even those with mental ill-health like depressive disorders or anxiety.\n\nHaving a believable companion to hand who is always listening and willing to interject or reach out as it feels is actually a rather beneficial application of this wearable. Though its marketing seems to be swaying leaning into the friendant being an irreplaceable life companion with vaguely awkward undertones.\n\nStill, how it works in reality is a whole other ball game.

It's about now, and it extrapolates today's tech and trends to talk about how we live and where we're heading. So it's not really surprising to see the 2013 movie Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix falls for his digital assistant, become closer to reality every day.\n\nThe latest example of sci-fi becoming reality appears to be Friend, an \"AI companion\" that feels like a cross between Her and a Black Mirror episode. The AI wearable, as described by The Verge, is a $99 glowing pendant that listens as you go about your day and can then talk to you about it.\n\nLet's talk about the tech first. Friend connects to an iPhone over Bluetooth and listens constantly. If you want to chat to your Friend you press a button; it sends its response as a message on your iPhone.\n\nIt can also respond to what's going on around you. So as a device it isn't more than a wireless phone mic (a version with a camera is also planned) for a ChatGPT-style chatbot. But the pendant is just the vehicle.\n\nThe goal is to create an AI that you consider part of your friend group. Or if you're feeling dystopian, that replaces it.\n\nCreator Avi Schiffmann originally intended the wearable as a productivity tool, but reckons that that's best left to Apple and OpenAI. Instead, Friend is supposed to be a portable pal: \"a great brainstorming buddy. You can talk to it about relationships, things like that.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Verge, Schiffmann says it's not intended to replace real friends - but he doesn't reject the idea that an AI might be one of the five people you spend most of your time with. As he describes it, it's like a pen pal without the delays crossed with a Tamagotchi virtual pet. But what springs to mind most for me is Destiny's Ghost, the robot sphere that follows you everywhere and tells you that wizards are coming from the moon.\n\nI'm rather cynical about AI. To me, it feels like it's another tech bubble where wild claims raise big sums of money for products that don't quite deliver: check out the reviews of the Rabbit R1 for a demonstration of how a good AI demo doesn't necessarily mean a good AI product. But my worry with this one isn't that it won't live up to its promises, but that it will.\n\nOver on X (formerly Twitter) you can see ample evidence of people interacting with bots that they think are real people. That's rarely a positive thing: the bots are largely sowing division, not bringing us together.\n\nLooking at the comments on The Verge and underneath the YouTube promo clip, lots of people seem to have the same concerns over Friend that I do.

As we immerse ourselves in the endless stream of social media feeds, video calls, and online interactions, we often find ourselves substituting genuine, face-to-face connections with virtual encounters. The convenience of instant communication has paradoxically led to a decline in meaningful conversations, as we become more accustomed to scrolling through curated images and status updates rather than engaging in deep, personal exchanges.\n\nMost people would probably meet this problem with a simple solution, like putting their smartphone back in their pocket and venturing out into the real world for a change. But not everyone. Avi Schiffmann's approach is to double down on digital communications, sprinkle in some artificial intelligence, and sling a good buddy around his neck. Called \"Friend,\" this digital buddy is worn as a pendant that continually listens in on your conversations and the ambient noises around you. When appropriate, Friend will text you with a contextually relevant message, with the aim of keeping you company.\n\nIt has often been said that you cannot buy true friendship, but you can by Friend for $99. For this price you get the always-listening pendant, which also has a single button that can be pressed when you want the device to take a more active role in a conversation than that of a good listener. From there, Friend must interact with an internet-connected iOS device before it sends you a text message in response.\n\nWhile there are few details about how Friend works, from the demonstrations and available information, it appears likely that the companion app sends transcriptions of your voice to a large language model (LLM) in the cloud before texting you the response. That being the case, anyone that has ever used an LLM will probably have some pretty strong suspicions that Friend will not have any chance of replacing real human interactions. But if you look at it more as a toy, then Friend may find a place in your life.\n\nOf course you would have to put a lot of trust in this device to wear it everywhere you go. It is noted that the communications are encrypted, but still, Friend is always listening and presumably transmitting your every word to an unknown server somewhere in the cloud. There may be friends in your real life that you trust with anything -- but can you say the same about this digital \"friend?\"", "source": {"uri": "hackster.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hackster.io"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audio Video Interleave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_screen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second screen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1742345/_iSZhhZg3Wr.blob?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=600&h=450&fit=min", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Enter Friend, an AI companion device that's turning heads and raising eyebrows with its extravagant spending and dramatic claims of idea theft.\n\nFriend: The $99 Pendant with a Pricey Domain\n\nWhile the likes of Rabbit and Humane have stumbled in the AI companion arena, Friend is making waves by racking up a stunning $50 million valuation. How, you ask? Well, the startup has reportedly spent a jaw-dropping $1.8 million on securing the domain name Friend.com. That's a whopping 72% of their total funding -- a figure that's leaving many scratching their heads and wondering if they've got their priorities mixed up.\n\nInvestors and Expenditures: A Curious Mix\n\nFriend, helmed by Avi Schiffmann, a Harvard dropout who previously made waves with his COVID-19 tracking site, has attracted notable investors including Caffeinated Capital's Raymond Tonsing and Solana founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Yet, rather than investing in high-tech features or cutting-edge innovation, the startup chose to splurge on a domain name. It seems Schiffmann's vision involves not just a digital friend but also a digital real estate empire.\n\nWhat's Behind the Pendant?\n\nSo, what does this AI companion do, apart from making headlines for its spending habits? The Friend pendant, priced at \u20b98,250 (or $99), is designed to be a constant companion. It listens to you via Bluetooth and sends you friendly messages, but it won't be writing your reports or making your coffee. It's essentially an AI that's always there to give you a virtual pat on the back -- or a good luck message before your big meeting.\n\nAnother Controversy Unfolds\n\nThe plot thickens with claims from Nik Shevchenko, founder of Based Hardware, who's accusing Friend of idea theft. Shevchenko insists that the concept of the AI pendant is his own, pointing to past posts on Product Hunt and hackathon events where he showcased a similar device. According to Shevchenko, Friend might not be as original as it claims, leading to a dramatic showdown over who truly owns the idea of a wearable AI buddy.\n\nThe Curious Case of the Overpriced Domain\n\nThe domain name debate has sparked considerable chatter. With $1.8 million spent on securing Friend.com, some are questioning whether the startup is more focused on digital real estate than on delivering a truly innovative product. Critics argue that the extravagant expenditure on a domain name might not be the best use of startup funds, especially when the tech itself is relatively simple.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nAs Friend prepares to start taking preorders for its AI pendant, set to ship in January 2025, the tech community is abuzz with mixed reactions. Will this high-priced domain strategy pay off, or will it become a cautionary tale of startup spending gone awry?

It connects to smartphones via bluetooth and is always listening, forming its own internal thoughts and proactively reaching out to users.\n\nA user posted on X, saying that \"Loneliness is a growing issue, and Avi Schiffman might have the solution.\"\n\nThe key features of \"Friend\" include, no subscription fees, privacy protection with end-to-end encryption, no storage of audio or transcripts beyond the context window, ability to pause interactions and review conversations.\n\nHowever, if the device is lost or damaged, there is no recovery plan for the memories stored on it.\n\nAI Wearables Everywhere\n\nThe development of AI-powered wearables is not new, but there is a growing interest in creating these devices. A few months ago, the US-based company Limitless launched the Limitless Pendant, an AI-powered wearable that captures user insights while ensuring privacy through features like Consent Mode, which selectively records voices with user consent.\n\nSimilarly, Humane AiPin, another AI wearable, seeks to reduce smartphone dependency and has generated excitement with upcoming features like AI agents, gesture-based unlocking, and Google Calendar integration.\n\nBeyond the US, South Korea's VTouch introduced the WIZPR ring, which enhances human-computer interaction through voice-based AI commands.\n\nNot being the first to introduce, earlier in 2020, Schiffmann has gained recognition for his COVID-19 tracking website, which provided up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases globally. The site gained hundreds of millions of users worldwide and was praised by health agencies and experts.\n\nAs the AI wearable market continues to evolve, \"Friend\" represents a unique approach focused on emotional companionship rather than productivity or multitasking.", "source": {"uri": "analyticsindiamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Analytics India Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gopika_raj@analyticsindiamag.com", "name": "Gopika Raj", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limitless (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End-to-end encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\u2013computer_interaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human\u2013computer interaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer multitasking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-31-at-6.11.49-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Founder Avi Shiffman unveiled 'Friend' , an AI wearable that one can don as a necklace. The $99 gizmo endeavors to stick around its users as their chuddy buddies, listening to their mundane weekdays or exciting weekendings, and gently nudging smart curated texts on their mobile screen, reminding that the 'Friend' is there no matter what. The released demo of the AI wearable shows the compassionate AI trickery solacing a trekker, a gamer, and a foodie enjoying a show, among others. Upon gently pressing the device, the pendant reacts contextually to the user and sends relevant text, akin to having a friend mumble in your ears. Friend leverages the prowess of Anthropic's Claude 3.5 LLM. The device packs 15 hours of battery power. Speaking with the Wired, Shiffman quips that the device is \"more vibe-based than productivity-based.'\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/friend-ai-pendant/\n\nEarlier in May, Schiffman revealed that he will be launching 'the most original consumer product in recent memory' on World Friendship Day! Last year, the lad tweeted that the end UX of a personal computer is to be a Friend! The AI app is available only on iOs devices and has no recovery plans if the gadget goes berserk or lost.\n\nFor those living under the rock, Avi Shiffman developed a covid tracker website when he was a 17-year-old high school lad.\n\n?lang=en\n\nMeanwhile, Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 slayer Marques Brownlee aka MKBHD, jibed \"Wait this isn't a skit?\" The Friend's founder replied that he will ship one and look forward to a positive review. Marques responded that he will give it a fair shot and \"cannot guarantee anything else!\"\n\nThe internet has been fairly divided over the usability and relevancy of the AI pendant. \"Why isn't it an app?\" asked a user. Another user claimed that \"no one is going to buy this.\" \"Created by someone with no real friends,\" ranted another. Yet another user dubbed the device as 'Dystopian junk.'\n\nSee Also: LinkedIn Cofounder Predicts 9-5 Jobs Will Die In Three Decades 'Automation Will Takeover'\n\nSee Also: Love In The Age Of AI: Japanese Turn To AI Bots For Dating Amid Sinking Birth Rate\n\nSee Also: Will Smith, Eminem And Other Celebs Hug Their Younger Selves In This AI Video; Netizens Are Both Amused And Horrified", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loneliness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demo (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trinity (nuclear test)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eminem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/default/00-aa-art-cover-new-2024-07-31t180625405_32rf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777002", "eventUri": "eng-9777002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

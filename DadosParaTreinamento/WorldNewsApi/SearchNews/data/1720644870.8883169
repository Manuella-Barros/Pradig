{"id": 231288712, "title": "LIVE: Local and European elections 2024: First councillor of 949 elected as count results start to roll in", "text": "Never trust the tallies for the Europeans': Eamon Ryan, leader of the Greens, was delighted to see Michael Pidgeon and Claire Byrne set to sit on the Dublin City Council with strong personal votes. Asked about the Greens in Europe, where Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe (Dublin) and Grace O\u2019Sullivan (South) are fighting to hang onto their seats in Brussels, he said: \u201cNo one should ever predict European count. \u201cI learned that myself back in 2014. At midnight, I was told by everyone that my seat was guaranteed. I went home and woke up my wife and told her I had won a seat. \u201cI crawled back at four in the morning with my tail between my legs and told her that actually I hadn't won a seat. So you never know. But I haven't heard from the tally down in Castlebar in Cork. \u201cI don't have any sense of it there. Here in Dublin, to talk to one or two people it seems Ciar\u00e1n (Cuffe) is with the chance and that in itself is very encouraging for us to be in the mix. \u201cIt's gonna be very tight for that last seat. We always said it is too close to call. But I think it could go Green, so fingers crossed.\u201d Senan Molony The Comeback Kid: There is only one story emanating in Westmeath and that is the stunning return of former OPW Minister Kevin \u2018Boxer\u2019 Moran to the local political fray. The Athlone taximan lost his D\u00e1il seat in the 2020 general election and had missed out on filling the county council seat vacated by his son, Jamie two years ago. However, that wait looks set to come to an end which showed the former junior minister making the comeback of all political comebacks with a staggering 1,922 first preferences from 16 boxes opened in Westmeath. On closer inspection, the father of two has secured 41pc of the voting share in Athlone MD, almost three times that of nearest rival and sitting Fianna F\u00e1il Cllr Aengus O\u2019Rourke. Speaking to the Irish Independent, Mr Moran said he had been left in awe at the huge mandate he now looks set to receive from the voting public of Athlone. \u201cIt is a massive vote and I want to thank the people of Athlone and surrounding areas for coming out to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI do know that tallies are coming in strong in my favour, but all boxes are not opened. I am overjoyed and overwhelmed. I took this election as my first election and by that I mean, I knocked on every door. I would have done over 9,000 houses and maybe a little along with that and I just put in a huge campaign.\u201d Asked whether the sheer size of his vote had already raised thoughts of a possible tilt at the next general election, Mr Moran insisted his focus was very much on returning to the local political arena. \u201cYou take every election as you face it and this is the locals first,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had a crystal ball to look into I would give you that answer (about general election run), but at this moment in time I sit as a local election candidate. My focus at this moment in time is to represent of people of Athlone and a strong local representative. I am really, really looking forward to it and to the challenges that lie ahead.\u201d Liam Cosgrove Shinner sigh of relief, Leo at the RDS and some Labour support for Europe Here's a snippet of what's going on in Dublin: - Former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is stationed in Simmonscourt at the RDS with his Fine Gael crew as 100pc tallies for his electoral area, Castleknock, show strong support for the party at 29pc. - First time candidate Luke Corkery, who works with Senator Regina Doherty in Leinster House, is also set to take a seat in Swords on Fingal County Council. - Meanwhile, some Sinn F\u00e9in strategists are breathing a slow sign of relief as hopes rise within the party for Lynn Boylan to take a European seat. - Labour are also hoping for a good day with early tallies polling strong for TD Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in.

For two starts in spring training, he pitched like a No. 1 pick should pitch. Then he injured his right elbow in early March and hasn\u2019t sniffed the Guardians\u2019 rotation since. Friday night, however, Williams may have made some progress. Cleveland\u2019s No.1 pick in 2021 threw five innings in a rehab start for Class AA Akron, allowing one run on four hits. Williams, topping out at 98 mph, struck out four while throwing 66 pitches. It was best and longest performance in five rehab starts, but manager Stephen Vogt was non-committal on when Williams will be ready to join the rotation. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling great,\u201d Vogt told reporters before Saturday\u2019s 6-3 win over Toronto. \u201cHe\u2019s got to five innings, 66 pitches and his velo was up to 98. He\u2019s feeling really good. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he feels today after throwing to determine what we do next.\u201d Vogt said ideally the Guardians would like to have Williams at \u201cfull go\u201d when he\u2019s ready to join the rotation. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re taking it a day at a time and we don\u2019t know (how long it will be),\u201d said Vogt. It will be interesting to see where Williams fits in a rotation that consists of Tanner Bibee, Logan Allen, Triston McKenzie, Carlos Carrasco and Ben Lively. Carrasco and Lively just turned in strong starts against Toronto on Friday and Saturday. Bibee and Allen have been solid of late. McKenzie is coming off a 2 1/3 inning start against the Mariners on Tuesday. Concert goes Shaquille O\u2019Neil, aka Shaq Diesel, brought his DJ show to Progressive Field after Saturday\u2019s 6-3 win over the Blue Jays. He was joined on stage by most of the Guardians including McKenzie, Steven Kwan, Tim Herrin, Austin Hedges, Lively, Carrasco and Will Brennan. McKenzie was singing on stage. Shaq told the crowd \u201cIf you get to the World Series, I\u2019ll be back. . .free of charge.\u201d New role When Nick Sandlin went on the injured list with a lower back soreness on Wednesday, Vogt needed someone to replace him as as a troubleshooting reliever who can pitch in the middle or late innings. Vogt said after Saturday\u2019s win that rookie Cade Smith has the job. Smith relieved Lively with two on, two out and Cleveland leading, 5-2. Smith ended the threat with one pitch as Daulton Varsho lined out to second. He started the seventh with two quick outs before walking Alejandro Kirk and being replaced by Scott Barlow to end the inning. \u201cThat was really Nick\u2019s role,\u201d said Vogt. \u201cWith Nick out, Cade has stepped in and taken that role and made it his own. He can still throw in leverage situations, just like Nick. \u201cWe talk about our bullpen\u2019s versatility over and over. Whatever situation we\u2019ve brought Cade into, he\u2019s the same. He attacks it the same way. Hes confident, he works hard and he\u2019s prepared.\u201d Sandlin said he\u2019s feeling better. \u201cI started feeling it in Cincinnati (June 11-June 12),\u201d said Sandlin. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t getting any better so we had to do something like this.\u201d The fire down below Connor Gillispie (2-7, 4.80) struck out seven and allowed five runs in six innings Friday as Class AAA Columbus lost to Worcester, 6-2. Kyle Manzardo, recently optioned, went 1 for 4. . .Gavin Williams had plenty of support in Akron in the RubberDucks\u2019 11-4 win over Binghamton. C.J. Kafus hit two three-run homers to give him six RBI in the game. Milan Tolentino and Kahlil Watson homered as well. . .Jay Driver (1-1, 0.44) allowed a run in the eighth inning as Class A Lake County lost to South Bend, 4-3. Trenton Denholm started and allowed two run on five hits over six innings. . .Esteban Gonzalez went 3 for 4 and stole his 27th base as Class A Lynchburg lost to Charleston, 3-0. Jackson Humphries (0-4, 5.29) allowed two runs in three innings in the loss. Finally Bo Naylor\u2019s two-run homer in the second inning Saturday was his first since he hit a grand slam against the Angels on May 4. He had gone 78 plate appearances without a homer. . .The Guards have had six sellouts this year. Saturday\u2019s crowd of 37,133 was the biggest of the season.", "summary": "Gavin Williams made his fifth and most promising rehab start on Friday at Class AA Akron.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/guardians/2024/06/decision-looming-if-gavin-williams-keeps-progressing-guardians-takeaways.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/ONHOADPJR5EFRP6LDZW64Q2S7I.jpg?auth=6df1342201ca25df7736ce63dfd1ae24ecd02b918cf1da0e81d754d5fe74b4ce&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:53:50", "author": "Paul Hoynes", "authors": ["Paul Hoynes"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.111}

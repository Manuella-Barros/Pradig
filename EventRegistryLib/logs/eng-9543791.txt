Colangelo left a senior role at the Biden Justice Department to join Bragg's team. Bragg afterward brought charges against the former president in April 2023, raising questions among some in the GOP about alleged politicization of the case.\n\nHouse Republicans are investigating Colangelo and his past work as he prosecutes Trump.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: HOUSE JUDICIARY INVESTIGATES BRAGG PROSECUTOR WHO HELD SENIOR ROLE IN BIDEN DOJ\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by Fox News Digital, DNC Services Corp/Democratic National Committee paid prosecutor Matthew Colangelo twice on Jan. 31, 2018. Colangelo was given two payments of $6,000, for a total of $12,000.\n\nThe \"description\" for the purpose of payment is labeled \"Political Consulting.\"\n\nNeither the Manhattan District Attorney's Office nor the DNC immediately responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nAt the time, Colangelo was serving in then-New York Attorney General Eric Scheiderman's office as the deputy attorney general for social justice, assuming the role from Bragg. Bragg, at the time, was appointed as chief deputy attorney general.\n\nTRUMP PROSECUTOR QUIT TOP DOJ POST FOR LOWLY NY JOB IN LIKELY BID TO 'GET' FORMER PRESIDENT, EXPERT SAYS\n\nSchneiderman resigned in May 2018 amid allegations of sexual assault. Barbara Underwood replaced him as New York attorney general.\n\nJust months after Colangelo received the payments from the DNC, in June 2018, Underwood, with Colangelo as executive deputy attorney general, filed a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that Trump used the foundation's charitable assets to pay off his legal obligations. The Trump Foundation ultimately agreed to dissolve in December 2018.\n\nBRAGG 'ALLOWED POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS' TO 'INFECT' PROSECUTION OF TRUMP, HOUSE JUDICIARY GOP SAYS\n\nColangelo stayed in the New York Attorney General's Office after Underwood's tenure, and under the leadership of current AG Letitia James, who took over in 2018, where he continued to work on Trump lawsuits and investigations.\n\nBut on Jan. 20, 2021, the first day of the Biden administration, Colangelo began serving as acting associate attorney general in the Justice Department.\n\nColangelo then became the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General at the Biden Justice Department. Colangelo helped to oversee multiple departments, including the Civil, Civil Rights, Antitrust and Tax Divisions.\n\nColangelo joined Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office in December 2022.\n\nTRUMP TRIAL: FORMER PRESIDENT 'INNOCENT,' DEFENSE SAYS AS DA ALLEGES 'CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY'\n\nPrior to his work in New York and in the Biden Justice Department, Colangelo worked in the Obama administration, serving in a number of different roles. Colangelo worked in the DOJ's civil rights division and served as the chief of staff to then-Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who later served as chair of the DNC in 2017.\n\nPerez was DNC chairman at the time Colangelo was paid for \"political consulting.\"\n\nColangelo also worked as a deputy assistant to then-President Obama and as the deputy director of the White House Economic Council.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is demanding that Attorney General Merrick Garland turn over records related to Colangelo's employment at the Justice Department as it conducts \"oversight of politically motivated prosecutions by state and local officials.\"\n\nBragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nA charge of falsifying business records typically is a misdemeanor, but Bragg, Colangelo and New York prosecutors must convince the jury that Trump allegedly falsified those records in the furtherance of \"another crime.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nProsecutors suggest that other crime was in violation of New York State law -- to prevent or promote election. On its face, as a stand-alone offense, that charge is also typically a misdemeanor.\n\nCoupling the alleged falsification of business records with alleged prevention or promotion of election becomes a felony crime, according to Bragg.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_F._Pomerantz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark F.

Now we see that a former Biden administration DOJ, currently one of the attorneys prosecuting former President Donald Trump in his New York fraud trial, accepted thousands from the DNC for \"political consulting.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee paid Trump prosecutor Matthew Colangelo thousands of dollars for \"political consulting\" in 2018, Fox News Digital has learned.\n\nColangelo delivered opening statements in the unprecedented criminal trial of former President Trump and currently serves as a top prosecutor with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's Office on the case.\n\nColangelo joined Bragg's office in December 2022 after the resignations of Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne -- prosecutors who were investigating Trump and resigned in protest of Bragg's initial unwillingness to indict the former president. Colangelo left a senior role at the Biden Justice Department to join Bragg's team. Bragg afterward brought charges against the former president in April 2023, raising questions among some in the GOP about alleged politicization of the case.\n\nThere's an interesting timeline here; the payments came in 2018, Colangelo began work at the Justice Department as an acting associate attorney general in 2021, and then resigned from the DOJ and took a position in New York working for DA Alvin Bragg in December of 2022.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by Fox News Digital, DNC Services Corp/Democratic National Committee paid Colangelo twice on Jan. 31, 2018. Colangelo was given two payments of $6,000, for a total of $12,000.\n\nThe \"description\" for the purpose of payment is labeled \"Political Consulting.\"\n\nGranted $12,000 isn't a huge amount in this game, but it's still significant.\n\nSee Related: Donald Trump Faces Possible Jail Time for Gag Order Violation in Manhattan Case\n\nTrump Calls Out Biden's 'Gestapo' Administration and 'Thug' Prosecutor Jack Smith at Private Gathering\n\nThis begs at least one question: What was Matthew Colangelo being paid to do, precisely? \"Political consulting\" could cover an awfully lot of ground. When the DNC was paying him for whatever he did, he was working as a \"deputy attorney general for social justice,\" which sure sounds like a patronage gig. What possible value could Colangelo have returned to the DNC that was worth $12,000 to them?\n\nAt the time, Colangelo was serving in then-New York Attorney General Eric Scheiderman's office as the deputy attorney general for social justice, assuming the role from Bragg. Bragg, at the time, was appointed as chief deputy attorney general.\n\nAt the very least, this is a conflict of interest. At the worst? A conspiracy to take down a former president who is, as of this writing, running ahead of his befuddled opponent in the polls. It is not at all unlikely that this was a cultivated placement of a compliant official, one that was known in advance to harbor animosity towards the former president and to put him in a position to take part in one of the most politically motivated prosecutions since the Roman Senatus Consultum Ultimum was used to sanction the Gracchii.\n\nThe revolving door between the Biden administration, the DNC, and the courts is on full display now, and the focus of the people going through that door is on the 2024 election.\n\nO, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_consulting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political consulting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_F._Pomerantz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark F.

prosecutor Matthew Colangelo was political...", "body": "A Manhattan prosecutor heading up the \"hush money\" case against former President Donald Trump was a political consultant for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2018 -- and once donated to Barack Obama.\n\nThe DNC paid Matthew Colangelo $12,000 in January 2018 for \"political consulting,\" Federal Election Commission filings show, and the prosecutor also donated $400 to Obama's first presidential campaign in 2008.\n\nColangelo, formerly the third-ranking official in President Biden's Justice Department, joined Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office in December 2022 as senior counsel in the criminal case against Trump.\n\nThe prosecutor's paid work for the DNC were first reported by Fox News Digital.\n\nBragg became the first of several prosecutors to indict the former president for alleged election interference in March 2023, charging Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records about the \"hush money.\"\n\nThe six-figure payments were allegedly concocted with Trump's ex-legal fixer, Michael Cohen, to cover up past affairs the then-presidential candidate had with porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nDuring opening arguments last month, Colangelo told jurors that Trump and Cohen participated in a \"criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,\" -- even though the case is not federal and the payments to reimburse Cohen weren't made until after Trump took office in January 2017.\n\nHouse Republican conference chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) thundered that the filings were more evidence of a politically motivated prosecution against Trump.\n\n\"I just uncovered that the Far Left NYC prosecutor sent from Biden's DOJ to arrest President Trump was PAID BY THE DNC,\" Stefanik posted on X. \"This is ILLEGAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE.\"\n\nNeither the DNC nor Bragg's office immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nColangelo previously served in the Obama administration as deputy director of the president's National Economic Council, chief of staff at the Department of Labor and deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ's Civil Rights Division.\n\nIn April 2017, Colangelo also collaborated on an op-ed with then-DNC chair Tom Perez that ripped Trump for tanking efforts to automatically enroll private-sector workers in local government retirement plans.\n\nThe piece also accused Senate Republicans of \"blowing up two centuries of precedent to ram through\" Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court in April 2017.\n\nAround the same time, Colangelo authored another op-ed and hosted a forum at Georgetown University knocking the Trump administration's decision to roll back other Obama-era regulations -- including a reversal of Title IX discrimination protections for students based on gender identity.\n\nThe Biden administration has since brought that Title IX rule back.\n\nColangelo went on to serve in the New York State Attorney General's office, assisting on an investigation of the Trump Foundation and signing on to a lawsuit against Trump's Commerce Department that opposed adding citizenship questions to the US Census in 2020.\n\nHe later briefly ascended to the role of acting associate attorney general under Biden before being appointed principal deputy associate attorney.\n\nBragg's office announced in December 2022 that Colangelo was hired to handle \"sensitive and high-profile white-collar investigations,\" among other duties.\n\nLast week, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan demanded records from Colangelo's time at the Justice Department.\n\n\"Since last year, popularly elected prosecutors -- who campaigned for office on the promise of prosecuting President Trump -- engaged in an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority: the indictment of a former President of the United States and current leading candidate for that office,\" Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"That a former senior Biden Justice Department official is now leading the prosecution of President Biden's chief political rival only adds to the perception that the Biden Justice Department is politicized and weaponized.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType":

The lawyer received $12,000 from the DNC in 2018 for \"political consulting\" in two payments of $6,000 on Jan. 31 of that year, FEC records show. (RELATED: Judge Imposing Double Standard By Gagging Trump But Giving Michael Cohen Free Rein, Legal Experts Say)\n\nTrump is unable to speak about Colangelo as Judge Juan Merchan imposed a gag order on him that prevents the former president from speaking about prosecutors on the case besides Bragg.\n\nColangelo was appointed in 2022 while Bragg was still investigating Trump in relation to a $130,000 payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her silent regarding an alleged affair. He delivered opening statements for the prosecution in April, arguing that Trump falsified business documents corresponding to the payment as part of a broader initiative to \"corrupt the 2016 election.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan sent a letter Tuesday to Attorney General Merrick Garland regarding Colangelo, requesting documents and communications from his tenure at the DOJ. Jordan demanded personnel files pertaining to Colangelo's hiring, employment and termination at the DOJ, as well as records and correspondences related to Trump or his organization.\n\n\"Bragg is engaged in one such politicized prosecution, which is being led in part by Matthew B. Colangelo, a former senior Justice Department official. Accordingly, given the perception that the Justice Department is assisting in Bragg's politicized prosecution, we write to request information and documents related to Mr. Colangelo's employment,\" Jordan wrote.\n\nWhile at the New York District Attorney's office, Colangelo led the probe into the Trump Foundation, which resulted in its dissolution, as well as leading the investigation that eventually became Trump's civil fraud case, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe DNC and Bragg did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Democratic National Committee and DNC Services Corp. made the payments on the same day in two separate payments totaling $6,000.\n\nThe report also notes that before joining Alvin Bragg's office in 2022, Colangelo worked in a senior role for the Biden Administration's DOJ which has prompted an investigation into Colangelo to be opened by House Republicans since Bragg's office brought the charges against Trump just four months after Colangelo's hiring.\n\nThese financial statements became public just months after Fulton County DA Fani Willis and prosecutor Nathen Wade faced questions about their professional relationship after it was confirmed that the two had taken expensive romantic vacations together, which led to Wade's eventual resignation from the case. Documents from January also revealed that Willis and Wade had visited the White House not long before RICO charges were brought against Trump in May and November of 2022, which was billed to taxpayers as an \"interview with DC/White House\" to the tune of $250 an hour, or $8,000 total, according to Newsweek.\n\nThe latest Harvard/Harris poll shows Trump continuing to hold on nationally against President Biden despite his legal cases, finding that 50% of voters would still vote for the former President even if he's convicted of mishandling classified documents or in Georgia's RICO case. 52% of respondents also told the poll that they'd still vote for Trump if convicted for inciting a riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th.", "source": {"uri": "wsau.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

political...", "body": "A Manhattan prosecutor heading up the \"hush money\" case against former President Donald Trump was a political consultant for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2018 -- and once donated to Barack Obama.\n\nThe DNC paid Matthew Colangelo $12,000 in January 2018 for \"political consulting,\" Federal Election Commission filings show, and the prosecutor also donated $400 to Obama's first presidential campaign in 2008.\n\nColangelo, formerly the third-ranking official in President Biden's Justice Department, joined Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office in December 2022 as senior counsel in the criminal case against Trump.\n\nThe prosecutor's paid work for the DNC were first reported by Fox News Digital.\n\nBragg became the first of several prosecutors to indict the former president for alleged election interference in March 2023, charging Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records about the \"hush money.\"\n\nThe six-figure payments were allegedly concocted with Trump's ex-legal fixer, Michael Cohen, to cover up past affairs the then-presidential candidate had with porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nDuring opening arguments last month, Colangelo told jurors that Trump and Cohen participated in a \"criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,\" -- even though the case is not federal and the payments to reimburse Cohen weren't made until after Trump took office in January 2017.\n\nHouse Republican conference chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) thundered that the filings were more evidence of a politically motivated prosecution against Trump.\n\n\"I just uncovered that the Far Left NYC prosecutor sent from Biden's DOJ to arrest President Trump was PAID BY THE DNC,\" Stefanik posted on X. \"This is ILLEGAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE.\"\n\nNeither the DNC nor Bragg's office immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nColangelo previously served in the Obama administration as deputy director of the president's National Economic Council, chief of staff at the Department of Labor and deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ's Civil Rights Division.\n\nIn April 2017, Colangelo also collaborated on an op-ed with then-DNC chair Tom Perez that ripped Trump for tanking efforts to automatically enroll private-sector workers in local government retirement plans.\n\nThe piece also accused Senate Republicans of \"blowing up two centuries of precedent to ram through\" Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court in April 2017.\n\nAround the same time, Colangelo authored another op-ed and hosted a forum at Georgetown University knocking the Trump administration's decision to roll back other Obama-era regulations -- including a reversal of Title IX discrimination protections for students based on gender identity.\n\nThe Biden administration has since brought that Title IX rule back.\n\nColangelo went on to serve in the New York State Attorney General's office, assisting on an investigation of the Trump Foundation and signing on to a lawsuit against Trump's Commerce Department that opposed adding citizenship questions to the US Census in 2020.\n\nHe later briefly ascended to the role of acting associate attorney general under Biden before being appointed principal deputy associate attorney.\n\nBragg's office announced in December 2022 that Colangelo was hired to handle \"sensitive and high-profile white-collar investigations,\" among other duties.\n\nLast week, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan demanded records from Colangelo's time at the Justice Department.\n\n\"Since last year, popularly elected prosecutors -- who campaigned for office on the promise of prosecuting President Trump -- engaged in an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority: the indictment of a former President of the United States and current leading candidate for that office,\" Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"That a former senior Biden Justice Department official is now leading the prosecution of President Biden's chief political rival only adds to the perception that the Biden Justice Department is politicized and weaponized.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

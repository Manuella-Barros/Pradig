For music fans, this means you can expect to see most of your favorite acts live at some point over the next few weeks (here are a few of Uproxx\u2019s recommendations). But if you\u2019re a day one Smashing Pumpkins supporter, don\u2019t expect the run-of-the-mill performance. With the \u201cBeguiled\u201d musicians slated to hit the road for their The World Is A Vampire Tour across Europe, ground rules have already been determined. On June 4, during on interview with Kerrang!, frontman Billy Corgan made it clear that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about \u201cappeasing fans\u201d when it comes to the band\u2019s setlist. \u201cI don\u2019t play any songs I don\u2019t want to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re a classic or not,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIf I don\u2019t want to play it, I just don\u2019t play it. I don\u2019t put that on the audience like, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to play this one for you.\u2019 I think that\u2019s kind of cheese.\u201d But there\u2019s a method to the band\u2019s live show madness. According to the musician, leaning toward less popular tracks will encourage concertgoers to revisit their past projects. \u201cHere\u2019s the best way I would say it: the best show for me would be, you\u2019re a fan that really is mostly focused on the older music,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then you might hear five, six, seven other songs, and you find yourself going, \u2018I don\u2019t know this one,\u2019 so you look up one, and go, \u2018Oh, that was a deep cut from 1996. I didn\u2019t know that one. It was some B-side. That\u2019s interesting.\u2019 And then someone making the same discovery about your new stuff, but thinking it was old. I\u2019m not talking about causing confusion. I\u2019m talking about having the person be curious about that.\u201d Smashing Pumpkins aren\u2019t the only musicians who\u2019ve spoken out about their setlists. Before his 2024 Coachella appearance, Tyler The Creator scolded users online for attempting to bully his song selection. With Smashing Pumpkins\u2019 first show slated for July 6, the public will see if their creative decision paid off.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"437\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Corgan-Smashing-Pumpkins-2023-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-1024x437-1.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=437&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"Billy Corgan Smashing Pumpkins 2023 BottleRock Napa Valley (1024x437)\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Corgan-Smashing-Pumpkins-2023-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-1024x437-1.jpeg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Corgan-Smashing-Pumpkins-2023-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-1024x437-1.jpeg?resize=300,128 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Corgan-Smashing-Pumpkins-2023-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-1024x437-1.jpeg?resize=704,300 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Corgan-Smashing-Pumpkins-2023-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-1024x437-1.jpeg?resize=768,328 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc", "url": "https://uproxx.com/indie/smashing-pumpkins-billy-corgan-appeasing-fans-setlists/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Corgan-Smashing-Pumpkins-2023-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-1024x437-1.jpeg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:05:43", "author": "Flisadam Pointer", "authors": ["Flisadam Pointer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.088}

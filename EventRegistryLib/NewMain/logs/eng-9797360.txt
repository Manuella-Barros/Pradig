The decision, which affects only 11 executives, allows 143 lawmakers to reorganize under a new party. The move comes amid political turbulence, escalating uncertainty and potential market upheavals.\n\nThailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday ordered the dissolution of the popular anti-establishment opposition party, Move Forward, over its controversial campaign to amend a law that protects the powerful monarchy from criticism. The disbandment of the 2023 election winner is the latest setback for Thailand's major political parties, which remain embroiled in a tumultuous two-decade battle for power with an influential nexus of conservatives, old money families and royalist generals.\n\nThe decision comes six months after the same court ordered Move Forward to drop its plan to reform a law on royal insults, ruling it was unconstitutional and risked undermining Thailand's system of governance with the king as head of state. Move Forward denies that. Though the dissolution is likely to anger millions of young and urban voters who backed Move Forward and its progressive agenda, the impact of the ruling is expected to be limited, with only the party's 11 current and former executives banned from politics for 10 years.\n\nThat means 143 of its lawmakers will keep their seats and are expected to reorganise under a new party, as they did in 2020, when predecessor Future Forward was disbanded over a campaign funding violation. If all join the same party, it would be the biggest in parliament and would be expected to continue a progressive agenda that includes military reform and undoing big business monopolies, among the policies that saw its rivals coalesce to block it from forming a government last year.\n\nThe decision comes at a critical juncture in Thai politics, with cracks appearing also in an uneasy truce between the royalist establishment and another longtime rival, the populist ruling party, Pheu Thai. The Constitutional Court will next week decide on a case brought by 40 conservative former senators seeking to dismiss Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin over his appointment to the cabinet of a lawyer who served time in jail. He denies wrongdoing and says the appointment was above board.\n\nTycoon Srettha's case is among factors that have heightened political uncertainty and roiled financial markets, with the prospect of political upheaval if he is removed. A new premier would need to be voted on by parliament, potentially pitting Pheu Thai against coalition partners and leading to a shakeup of the governing alliance and realignment of cabinet and policies.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_Forward_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Move Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheu_Thai_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pheu Thai Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/17_07_2024_07_36_22_7992658.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797360", "eventUri": "eng-9797360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Chatkla Samnaingjam)BANGKOK (AP) - A court in Thailand on Wednesday ordered the dissolution of the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in last year's general election, saying it violated the constitution by proposing an amendment of a law against defaming the country's royal family. The Constitutional Court said it voted unanimously to dissolve the party because its campaign to amend the law was considered an attempt to overthrow the nation's constitutional monarchy. The Move Forward Party was unable to form a government after topping the polls because members of the Senate, at that time a conservative military-appointed body, refused to endorse its candidate for prime minister. The Election Commission had filed a petition against the Move Forward Party after the Constitutional Court ruled in January that it must stop advocating changes to the law, known as Article 112, which protects the monarchy from criticism with penalties of up to 15 years in jail per offense. The ruling Wednesday also imposed a 10-year ban on political activity for those who held the party's executive positions while it campaigned for the proposed amendment. Among them are its charismatic former leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, and current chief Chaithawat Tulathon. It remained unclear what will happen to the rest of its non-executive lawmakers, although Pita said in an interview with The Associated Press that the party will ensure they have a \"smooth transition into a new house,\"\u009d or a new party. Lawmakers of a dissolved political party can keep their seats in Parliament if they move to a new party within 60 days. Move Forward and its reform agenda shook up Thai politics by winning the most seats in the 2023 elections even though it was then blocked from taking power.

Move Forward was later removed from a coalition formed with the now-governing Pheu Thai party and became head of the opposition. In its arguments submitted to the court, Move Forward said the Constitutional Court does not have jurisdiction to rule on the case and the petition filed by the Election Commission did not follow due process because Move Forward was not given an opportunity to defend itself before it was submitted to the court. The court said in its ruling that it has the authority to decide the case, and that its previous ruling in January was sufficient evidence for the Election Commission to file the case without having to hear more evidence from the party. Human rights organizations and other advocacy groups expressed concern about the court's ruling. \"The decision is not a surprise, and is unlikely to spur large-scale protests given that Move Forward MPs will remain a force in Parliament, albeit under a different banner,\" Matthew Wheeler, a regional analyst for the Brussels-based Crisis Group, said in an email. \"But the decision is a further illustration that the 2017 constitution, drafted at the behest of coupmakers and approved in a flawed referendum, was designed to curb the popular will rather than facilitate its expression. It shows that Thailand is still a long way from achieving a consensus on the appropriate sources of political legitimacy, with the establishment digging in its heels against the will of the electorate.\"\u009d Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has maintained that the Thai justice system is fair and impartial, and that the government cannot interfere with the judicial process. Move Forward's predecessor, the Future Forward party, was dissolved by the Constitutional Court in 2020 on charges of violating election laws on donations to political parties. Thailand's courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are considered a bulwark of the country's royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to issue rulings to cripple or sink political opponents. The dissolution of Future Forward, whose promises of reforms were particularly attractive for younger people disillusioned after years of military rule, further highlighted the struggle between the progressive movement and conservative forces. It was one of the triggers for youth-led pro-democracy protests that sprang up across the country in 2020. The protests openly criticized the monarchy, an institution previously considered untouchable and a linchpin of Thai society. The protests led to vigorous prosecutions under Article 112, which previously had been relatively rarely employed. Critics say the law is often wielded as a tool to quash political dissent. Move Forward, formed as a new home for lawmakers from the dissolved Future Forward party, campaigned for an amendment of the article and other democratic reforms in the 2023 elections. It won first place in the balloting, a surprise victory indicating that many Thai voters were ready for change. Move Forward has insisted that it wants to keep the monarchy above politics and not be exploited as a political tool.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_Forward_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Move Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pita Limjaroenrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheu_Thai_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pheu Thai Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Forward_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Future Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/2024080705084-66b338e1ae6ea3a5ed428ff3jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797360", "eventUri": "eng-9797360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Among them are its charismatic former leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, and current chief Chaithawat Tulathon.\n\nIt remained unclear what will happen to the rest of its non-executive lawmakers, although Pita said in an interview with The Associated Press that the party will ensure they have a \"smooth transition into a new house,\" or a new party.\n\nLawmakers of a dissolved political party can keep their seats in Parliament if they move to a new party within 60 days.\n\nMove Forward and its reform agenda shook up Thai politics by winning the most seats in the 2023 elections but was blocked from taking power. The latest legal action is one of many that have drawn widespread criticism and are seen as part of a yearslong attack on the country's progressive movement by conservative forces trying to keep their grip on power.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The 2020 ruling ignited the youth-led protests that called for sweeping democratic reforms, including changes to the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law.\n\nThe court, in its verdict Wednesday, ruled on a pair of complaints lodged against Move Forward over the party's campaign promise to do away with Article 112.\n\nPreviously, the Constitutional Court accepted a petition from Teerayut Suwankesorn, a former lawyer for former monk Suwit Thongprasert (better known as Buddha Issara), an ultra-royalist and a key leader of the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC).\n\nHe petitioned the court to rule on whether the party's use of the Article 112 abolition issue in its election campaign constituted an attempt to topple the government under the monarchy.\n\nOn Jan. 31, 2024, the Constitutional Court ruled that campaigning to abolish Article 112 amounted to an attempt to overthrow the government. The court prohibited any future campaigns or expressions of opinion on this matter.\n\nConsequently, on March 18, 2024, the Election Commission (EC) submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court seeking a ruling to dissolve the Move Forward Party based on these circumstances.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin declined to comment on the Move Forward Party case, despite stating a day earlier that the government had no right to interfere with the country's courts.\n\nHe had previously said that Thailand's judicial process was neutral, internationally recognized, and accepted by all parties.\n\n\"Personally, I respect the judicial process. In my own case regarding my eligibility to serve as Prime Minister, if there are complaints, they must be submitted to the justice system for a decision. Our country is independent, and we must respect that,\" Srettha stated at Government House on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a post-electoral impasse in 2023, and due to a constitutional provision granting 250 junta-appointed senators the power to vote for prime minister, Pita failed to secure the legislature's approval to be elected PM.\n\nThat led to Pheu Thai, the second-largest party which had won 141 parliamentary seats, taking over the process to form a government. Move Forward was excluded from the coalition as other parties claimed they could not work with a party proposing to abolish Article 112.\n\nAfter Wednesday's ruling, Move Forward's 147 current MPs will have 60 days to join new parties to retain their parliamentary seats. It remains unclear where these MPs might go or if party leaders will form a new party.\n\nThailand has a history of political parties being dissolved.\n\nIn 2007, the Thai Rak Thai Party, led by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was ordered dissolved by the Constitutional Court for actions deemed as potentially inciting the overthrow of the government. This led some members to form the People's Power Party, which was later also dissolved, eventually resulting in the creation of the current Pheu Thai Party.\n\nSince 2007, at least 17 political parties have been dissolved by court order.\n\nIn the months leading up to the court's decision on Wednesday, the case against Move Forward had reignited a debate about the delicate balance between protecting the monarchy and upholding democratic freedoms in Thailand.\n\nThe Move Forward Party's progressive policies struck a chord with younger Thai voters in particular, but these were fiercely opposed by the military-backed parties and royalists that have long dominated Thai politics.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nThai court accepts case seeking to disband Move Forward Party\n\nThailand Election

REUTERS/Chalinee Thirasupa\n\nBy Chayut Setboonsarng and Panu Wongcha-um\n\nBANGKOK (Reuters) -Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday ordered the dissolution of the anti-establishment opposition party Move Forward, ruling its campaign to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism risked undermining the democratic system.\n\nThe disbandment of Move Forward, which won most seats in the 2023 election, is the latest setback for Thailand's major political parties that are embroiled in a two-decade battle for power against a nexus of influential conservatives, old money families and the royalist military.\n\nThe decision, which included 10-year political bans for 11 party executives, comes six months after the same court ordered Move Forward to drop its plan to reform a law on royal insults, ruling it was unconstitutional and tantamount to undermining the system of governance with the king as head of state.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling that cited the court's January decision, the judges said Move Forward had improperly used the monarchy to gain an election advantage, putting the palace in conflict with the people.\n\n\"The action of the accused is therefore an action that may antagonize the democratic system with the king as the head of state,\" they said in the ruling.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn has been on the throne for seven years. The monarch is enshrined in the constitution as being in a position of \"revered worship\" and the palace is seen by royalists as sacrosanct. Perceived insults of the monarchy are punishable by up to 15 years in jail.\n\nMove Forward has repeatedly denied seeking to undermine the royal family. The party had no immediate comment on the ruling and was due to give a press conference later on Wednesday.\n\nBACKUP PLAN\n\nThough the dissolution is likely to anger millions of young and urban voters who backed Move Forward and its progressive agenda, the impact of the ruling is expected to be limited.\n\nThe party's surviving 143 lawmakers will keep their seats in parliament and are expected to reorganise under a new party, as they did in 2020, when predecessor Future Forward was disbanded over a campaign funding violation.\n\nMove Forward's influential rivals coalesced to block the party from forming a government last year but the progressive movement remains a political force and a threat to the status quo, bent on pursuing a platform that includes military reform and undoing big business monopolies.\n\nIt is not yet out of the woods, however, with 44 of its current and former politicians, including 26 legislators, the subject of a complaint to an anti-graft body by conservative activists seeking lifetime political bans over the campaign to change the royal insults law.\n\nSome supporters called for protests against the decision. At Move Forward's headquarters, its loyalists expressed both disappointment and disbelief at the ruling.\n\n\"It feels like we have hit rock bottom, truly hit rock bottom,\" said Sirinapa Veillet, 58. \"It feels like we have no support left, none at all,\" she said of Thailand's democratic institutions.\n\nAmnesty International in a statement called the ruling an \"untenable decision\" and said authorities were relentlessly harassing the political opposition.\n\nMove Forward's disbandment comes at critical juncture in Thai politics, with cracks appearing also in an uneasy truce between the military-backed establishment and another longtime rival, the populist ruling party, Pheu Thai.\n\nPheu Thai has suffered most in Thailand's intractable crisis, with four of its prime ministers toppled by coups and court rulings and three previous incarnations dissolved by courts, leading to at times violent street demonstrations.\n\nThe Constitutional Court will next week decide on a case brought by 40 conservative former senators seeking to dismiss Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin over his appointment to cabinet of a lawyer who served time in jail. Srettha denies wrongdoing.\n\nTycoon Srettha's case is among factors that have heightened political uncertainty, with the prospect of political upheaval if he is removed.\n\nA new premier would need to be voted on by parliament, potentially pitting Pheu Thai against coalition partners and leading to a shakeup of the governing alliance and realignment of cabinet and policies.\n\n(Reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat, Chayut Setboonsarng, Panu Wongcha-um and Napat Wesshasartar; Editing by Martin Petty and Angus MacSwan)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pita Limjaroenrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_Forward_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Move Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Forward_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Future Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajiralongkorn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vajiralongkorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017\u201318_Tercera_Divisi\u00f3n", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017\u201318 Tercera Divisi\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheu_Thai_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pheu Thai Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kickboxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kickboxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/8d/e8d9e216-0ff1-51cc-8b26-c195784e72a8/66b32d89d84ea.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C43&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797360", "eventUri": "eng-9797360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The dissolution was \"unavoidable,\" the court said in an unanimous decision.\n\nThe decision followed a ruling in January by the same court that found Move Forward's campaign pledge to amend the royal defamation law, known as Article 112, amounted to an attempt to overthrow the country's political system as a constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe law -- one of the strictest in the world -- criminalises insults to Thailand's monarch and his immediate family, and carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nThis year, Pita told the Financial Times that a ruling to disband the party would \"turbocharge\" Thailand's progressive movement seeking to challenge the country's military-royalist elite.\n\nMove Forward remains the country's most popular political force, having galvanised Thailand's youth and urban voters in last year's election with promises of sweeping reforms that riled conservatives and military-backed parties.\n\nDespite winning the most parliamentary seats, the party was blocked from power by pro-military lawmakers, who aligned with former premier Thaksin Shinawatra's party to prevent Move Forward from forming a government.\n\nPita also faces a lifetime ban from politics over a separate petition filed with Thailand's anti-graft commission over the l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 issue.

The runner-up Pheu Thai Party subsequently formed a new coalition without Move Forward, and the latter moved into the opposition.\n\nThe amendments proposed by MFP included a requirement that any lese-majeste complaint must be filed by the Bureau of the Royal Household. Currently, any individual or group can file a royal defamation complaint against anyone else, and police are obliged to investigate it.\n\nMove Forward also called for reduced sentences for lese-majeste convictions.\n\nOn Jan 31, the Constitutional Court ruled that Move Forward's efforts to change Section 112 reflected an intention to undermine the constitutional monarchy. It also ordered the party to cease all attempts to rewrite Section 112 and prohibited it from amending the section through any non-legislative process.\n\nThe ruling provided the basis for the Election Commission to seek the party's dissolution for violating Section 92 of the organic law on political parties. The section authorises the court to dissolve any party posing a threat to the constitutional monarchy.\n\nMove Forward denied wrongdoing and maintained that the poll body made fundamental errors. It lined up numerous legal scholars and others who were prepared to back its case, but the court has declined to hear any oral testimony.\n\nThe court on Wednesday said that all of the conclusions it reached on Jan 31 also applied in the new case. In the earlier case, it said, Move Forward had the opportunity to present evidence before the court. Therefore a witness examination by the Election Commission was not necessary.\n\nMove Forward rose from the ashes of the Future Forward Party, which was dissolved in 2020 for accepting a loan from one of its founders. A year earlier it had shocked pundits by winning more than 80 seats in the general election.\n\nWhen Future Forward was disbanded, its MPs moved to Move Forward, a party that had been founded in 2014 and based in Udon Thani.\n\nIt has been reported that all Move Forward MPs were preparing to move to the little-known Thinkakhao Chaovilai Party if the party was dissolved.\n\nThe party was preparing to hold a news conference at 6pm to announce its plans.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Thailand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_Forward_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Move Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pita Limjaroenrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheu_Thai_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pheu Thai Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Forward_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Future Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udon_Thani", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Udon Thani"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Udon Thani"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20240807/c1_2843182_700.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797360", "eventUri": "eng-9797360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-31", "textStart": 1182, "textEnd": 1188, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-05-", "textStart": 563, "textEnd": 569}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But it scored a stunning victory in Thailand's election last year, as millions of voters delivered a rebuke to the country's monarchy, its military and its moneyed elite.\n\nThe old guard reacted swiftly, moving to crush its most formidable challenger in decades. Conservative politicians prevented the Move Forward Party's leader from becoming prime minister and engineered a coalition that kept the party out of power.\n\nOn Wednesday, their quest to reverse the election results seemed complete: Move Forward was disbanded by Thailand's Constitutional Court over charges that the party's proposals to water down a stringent royal defamation law were an attempt to overthrow the monarchy. The court also barred from politics for a decade 11 party members and executives, including Pita Limjaroenrat, its former leader and prime ministerial candidate.\n\nBut stamping out the party could reignite the discontent that fueled its rise in the first place.\n\nBreaking up Move Forward would not end the progressive movement's \"journey to change Thailand,\" Mr. Pita said in Parliament in April. On the contrary, he said, it could \"make us reach the victory line\" even faster.\n\nIn an interview around that time, Mr. Pita said the old guard's intentions were clear. \"This is trying to get rid of opposition,\" he said. \"And without opposition, there's no democracy.\"\n\nIn Thailand, which has had a dozen coups in the past century, elections are often meant to provide a junta with a veneer of democracy. The vote in May of last year, held after nearly a decade of stultifying military rule, was expected to be no different.\n\nIn recent decades, Thai politics have been dominated by clashes between the entrenched royalist-military establishment and forces allied to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist billionaire. Another tycoon, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, shook the status quo several years ago, with calls for reducing the military's influence in politics and equitably distributing wealth. But his Future Forward Party ran afoul of the junta and was disbanded in 2020.\n\nThat catalyzed a wave of anti-junta protests. Many young people openly criticized the king's lavish wealth, a topic previously thought of as taboo. Dozens were punished under Thailand's draconian l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law, which makes it a crime to criticize the king or certain members of his family.\n\nMove Forward effectively succeeded the Future Forward Party. It tapped into that anti-establishment sentiment during last year's election. The party campaigned on proposals to shrink the army's budget, abolish conscription and break up big businesses like Thailand's alcohol monopoly. And it called for weakening the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law -- a demand that would eventually lead to its undoing.\n\nMove Forward's victory at the polls was remarkable and unexpected. It captured a broad swath of support across age groups and regions, winning in places like Phuket, once a military and conservative stronghold, and Bangkok, the capital.\n\nIts platform included legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing a $13 daily minimum wage. Unlike other political parties in Thailand, which depend on rich megadonors, it relied on smaller donations from the public so it could stay independent.\n\nIt also had a consistent message: that it would never cooperate with the generals who seized power in the 2014 coup. It embraced several young protesters who participated in the 2020 demonstrations in Bangkok, integrating them into the party.\n\nMove Forward called for reducing the jail terms of people who had violated the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law and making the Bureau of the Royal Household the only agency allowed to bring suits under the law. Currently, any Thai citizen can file such complaints, and Move Forward said the law was being used as a political weapon.\n\nMore than 270 people have been charged under the law since 2020, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a watchdog.\n\nMr. Pita, a charismatic Harvard graduate and an astute user of social media, said his party's proposals were a \"middle path.\" He pointed out that a former prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, had agreed to look into reforming the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law in 2009. But Thai royalists argued that amending it could eventually lead to abolishing the monarchy altogether.\n\nMove Forward's platform put it on a collision course with Thailand's two dominant institutions, the military and the palace -- both of which have \"consolidated their powers\" to an unprecedented level, according to Thongchai Winichakul, a Thai historian and emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\"In their view, M.F.P. is the enemy that they have to get rid of as soon as possible,\" Mr. Thongchai said, using an acronym for Move Forward.\n\nMove Forward had its share of critics. Detractors have called party officials \"childish\" or \"too radical.\" Some analysts questioned whether it had the mettle to govern the country.\n\nBut the royalist-military order saw the party as a threat. First, a military-appointed Senate blocked Mr. Pita from becoming prime minister. Then, Move Forward lost a coalition partner, Pheu Thai, a party founded by Mr. Thaksin, which started an alliance with conservative and military-backed parties.\n\nThat pushed Move Forward into the opposition. A few months later, in January, the Constitutional Court ruled that Move Forward's campaign to weaken the royal defamation law was tantamount to treason.\n\nIn February, Mr. Pita, along with senior leaders from the now-defunct Future Forward, was handed a suspended two-year sentence after being found guilty of organizing a protest in 2019. He was effectively banned from the premiership for two years.\n\nMove Forward's political troubles did not appear to dent its popularity. A poll of 2,000 people conducted in March by Thailand's National Institute of Development Administration, a graduate school and research agency, found that Mr. Pita was their top pick for prime minister, and 48.5 percent of them said they would vote for Move Forward if the election were held that day.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [],

Move Forward denies that.\n\nThough the dissolution is likely to anger millions of young and urban voters who backed Move Forward and its progressive agenda, the impact of the ruling is expected to be limited, with only the party's 11 current and former executives banned from politics for 10 years.\n\nThat means 143 of its lawmakers will keep their seats and are expected to reorganise under a new party, as they did in 2020, when predecessor Future Forward was disbanded over a campaign funding violation.\n\nIf all join the same party, it would be the biggest in parliament and would be expected to continue a progressive agenda that includes military reform and undoing big business monopolies, among the policies that saw its rivals coalesce to block it from forming a government last year.\n\nBangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday following weeks of deadly protests. The decision comes at critical juncture in Thai politics, with cracks appearing also in an uneasy truce between the royalist establishment and another longtime rival, the populist ruling party, Pheu Thai.\n\nThe Constitutional Court will next week decide on a case brought by 40 conservative former senators seeking to dismiss Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin over his appointment to cabinet of a lawyer who served time in jail.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing and says the appointment was above board. Tycoon Srettha's case is among factors that have heightened political uncertainty and roiled financial markets, with the prospect of political upheaval if he is removed.\n\nA new premier would need to be voted on by parliament, potentially pitting Pheu Thai against coalition partners and leading to a shakeup of the governing alliance and realignment of cabinet and policies.", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@arynews.tv", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheu_Thai_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pheu Thai Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Thai.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797360", "eventUri": "eng-9797360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

A real question mark is how much discontent this will generate,\" she said.\n\n\"Because one of the biggest reasons why the Move Forward Party won the last election was all of the discontent stemming from the Future Forward Party dissolution.\"\n\nDr Sinpeng said that discontent turned into a three-year youth-led movement during the Covid-19 pandemic that fuelled votes for MFP.\n\n\"So can a new party turn that into votes at the next election?\" she asks.\n\nDr Sinpeng said that the likely reorganisation of the MFP could take it into an even more reformist direction.\n\n\"One of the biggest reasons why the Future Forward Party wasn't as mainstream was because people thought they were quite disruptive and radical,\" she said.\n\n\"And then instead of trying to appeal to the centre and become less extreme, they became more extreme, then they won the election.\n\n\"They became much more vocal about reforming the monarchy.

The court also banned its leaders, including its prime ministerial candidate Pita Limjaroenrat, from political activities or running for public office for ten years.\n\nUnder Thai election rules, about 150 Move Forward lawmakers in the 500-member House of Representatives, must now move to a new party within 60 days.\n\nThe country's Election Commission sought the progressive party's dissolution after a ruling earlier this year that the group's bid to amend the royal insult law amounted to an attempt to overthrow Thailand's constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe dissolution risks pushing Thailand into a fresh spell of political unrest, with the same court also set to rule next week on a petition to oust Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for an alleged ethical breach. The threat of fresh political upheaval comes amid an exodus by investors from the nation's stocks, and can potentially derail Srettha's attempts to reboot an economy that's notched an average sub-2% growth rate in the past decade, well below its regional peers.\n\nMove Forward disrupted Thai politics by winning the most parliamentary seats in last year's election. Its supporters were largely young and urban voters who had grown frustrated with the nearly decade-long military-backed administrations.\n\nConservative Sway\n\nThe Harvard-educated Pita, whose bid to form a government was thwarted by conservative politicians and a military-appointed Senate, has denied the charges and accused the poll agency of not following proper procedures in the case.\n\nThe party was the most popular in the country, with Pita being the top choice as a prime ministerial candidate, according to a June survey by the National Institute of Development Administration.\n\nThe upstart party antagonized Thailand's pro-royalist conservative establishment that's held sway over national politics since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 with its call for reforms. Wednesday's ruling is in line with the charter court's verdict in January, when judges ordered the party to cease all its activities to amend the royal insult law.\n\nThe dissolution is a full circle for Move Forward, which replaced its predecessor Future Forward when it was dissolved by the same court for breaching election rules for financing in 2020. Its key leaders were also barred from politics for a decade. The ruling then sparked an unprecedented youth-led protest movement that called for the resignation of the then military-backed prime minister and reforms of the monarchy.\n\nPita, who led the party in last year's election, has said it has a new group in the wings to take over in the event of a dissolution, though he hasn't officially divulged any details.

Thailand's constitutional court banned him from politics for 10 years on Wednesday, and ordered the dissolution of his party.\n\nHe was reinstated as MP only in January 2024, after wininng a trial supporters say was aimed at ending his political career. The establishment had sought to disqualify him from parliament for owning shares in a long-defunct media company.\n\nVoters had handed more seats and votes to Move Forward than any other party in the May 2023 poll, rejecting nearly a decade of army-backed rule. That was no mean achievement in a country that had experienced at least a dozen successful coups.\n\n\"The sentiment of the era has changed. And it was the right timing,\" Mr Pita had said, speaking at the party's headquarters in Bangkok, where it had won 32 of the city's 33 seats.\n\nDespite the mandate, Thailand's unelected senate blocked the charismatic politician from becoming prime minister\n\nStill, Mr Pita and his reformist party built a strong following among young voters disillusioned by years of military rule and hungry for change.\n\nHe started his political career when he was elected to parliament in 2019 as a member of the Future Forward Party.\n\nFounded by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a billionaire and staunch critic of the army, Future Forward performed well in the 2019 election, shaking up Thai politics with its demand for reform.\n\nBut the party was forced to disband the following year after contentious allegations that its leaders said were politically motivated.

Among them are its former leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, and current leader Chaithawat Tulathon.\n\nSpeaking to supporters and the media on Wednesday evening, Limjaroenrat said although he had to say goodbye as a politician, he looks forward to continuing his work as a citizen.\n\nPeople might be frustrated today, but they should vent their frustration at the ballot box in every election from now on, he said.\n\nHe added that he was \"absolutely proud\" of what he had achieved and had no regrets.\n\n\"I have left my dent in the universe. And I'll make sure that I pass the baton to the next-generation leaders,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers of a dissolved political party who are not banned from politics can keep their seats in parliament if they move to a new party within 60 days.\n\nLimjaroenrat said that party members would carry on \"in a new vehicle\" to be introduced today, although he would not be a part of it.\n\nThe party declined to announce details of the changeover.\n\nMove Forward had 148 lawmakers in parliament. If they all move together, they would lose five seats belonging to the now-banned party executives.\n\n\"We're going to stick to the same path. A political party is only a vehicle, so let's wait and see the new party to which the MPs will be going,\" said Attaphon Buaphat, who gathered with other party supporters at its headquarters in Bangkok. \"You can get rid of the agents, the representatives for these people's beliefs, but you are not going to be able to get rid of the beliefs.\"", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_Forward_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Move Forward Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Thailand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita_Limjaroenrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pita Limjaroenrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Thailand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_Thailand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/08/09/P05-240809-311.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797360", "eventUri": "eng-9797360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 460829113, "relevance": 2}

The mission for me and the party is to create a government for change in 2027,\" Natthaphong said, referring to the next election.\n\nThe dissolution, which was criticised by major western countries, was the latest salvo in a two-decade battle for power that has pit Thailand's conservative establishment and royalist military against political parties with mass appeal.\n\nMove Forward's disruptive, liberal agenda made it some powerful enemies, taking on entrenched interests with plans that include reforming the military and dismantling business monopolies worth billions of dollars.\n\nIts bid to amend a law on royal insults was its undoing, riling influential generals and royalists with far-reaching connections, who see the monarchy as sacrosanct.\n\n'The establishment won't stop'\n\nThough the court in January ordered Move Forward to drop its campaign to amend article 112, as the lese-majeste law is known, Natthaphong said the new party would revive it but tread carefully.\n\nThe law is one of the world's strictest of its kind, with up to 15 years imprisonment for each perceived insult of the Thai crown. Hundreds of people have been prosecuted under the law in recent years, which the palace typically does not comment on.\n\n\"We propose to amend article 112 to ensure that this law is not a political tool used to abuse others, but we won't be careless,\" Natthaphong said.\n\n\"We will continue to push for the improvement and fixing of this law, which is still problematic.\"\n\nThe People's Party is the third incarnation of the progressive Future Forward party, which was dissolved for a campaign finance violation in 2020, triggering nationwide anti-government protests.\n\nThe English name People's Party was commonly used by the Khana Ratsadon, which launched a 1932 revolution that ended the Thailand's absolute monarchy.\n\nTitipol Phakdeewanich, a political science professor at Ubon Ratchathani University, said it was clear the new party would be on a collision course with Thailand's old elite, regardless of whether they pursue changes to article 112.\n\n\"The party will continue to be a thorn in the establishment's side, which means they will find whatever ways to bring the party down again. The establishment won't stop,\" Titipol said.\n\n\"But it doesn't mean that they will be successful in hurting the popularity of this party.

Chris Huston, the city\u2019s manager of drinking water distribution, said the city was inspecting the feeder line that ruptured Wednesday, but that it would take time to repair. \u201cIt\u2019s complex,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything goes well, we\u2019re looking at another five to seven days.\u201d City crews have reached the damaged section of the water main break and overnight were able to clear water, dirt and debris in order to analyze the location of the leak, the city said in a Saturday media release. It added that crews are preparing the feeder main for inspection in order to determine next steps towards cutting the damaged section of pipe and replacing it. City of Calgary Water Services Director Nancy Mackay said Saturday that water demand for the city and surrounding communities of Airdrie, Chestermere and Okotoks was 484 million litres, which was equal to the city\u2019s ability to provide water. \u201cWe made progress on pumping water,\u201d Mackay said. \u201cAnd our (water) supply is in a more sustainable position (as a result).\u201d While residents met the challenge Friday, Mackay issued a warning about water use over the weekend, with a particular focus on the need to not use water for outdoor activities. That includes watering lawns, filling pools, hot tubs, washing cars and gardening. \u201cI\u2019m a gardener,\u201d Mackay said, \u201cbut this is not the time to garden.\u201d Calgary mayor Jyoti Gondek was more blunt. After thanking residents for restricting their water use and helping the city meet its goal of a 25 per cent reduction in water consumption, she said city water supply is still in crisis and will be for the coming week. \u201cWe will run out of water if we don\u2019t take some individual actions,\u201d she said. Pointing to the community of Bowness, where the water main break occurred, Gondek took time to thank more than 700 businesses in the community who she said are doing everything they can to limit water use. \u201cKeep using businesses in Bowness,\u201d she said. \u201cBuy coffee, buy a pastry. \u201cThey could really use your support right now.\u201d Fire ban in place An active fire ban remains in place, said Sue Henry, Calgary\u2019s emergency management agency chief. \u201cThis allows for our fire department to ensure they have water available for any critical firefighting work,\u201d she said. Henry said the city has received 300 calls on its 311 line reporting water misuse, and 23 calls relating to the fire ban. No tickets have been issued so far, but could be in the future, she added. Boil water advisory continues A boil water advisory remains in effect for Bowness. Mackay said the timeline for the lifting of that could extend beyond the 5-7 days required to fix the feeder main, as the city needs the water supply to return to normal before it can flush the pipes in Bowness. Road restrictions remain in place. Drivers are encouraged to avoid the area around 16 Ave. and Home Road. Updates are available at Calgary.ca/wateroutages.

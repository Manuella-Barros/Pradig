{"id": 231958412, "title": "Former Giants WR Signs With NFC Playoff Hopeful", "text": "The NFL offseason is always filled with twists and turns, giving teams hope for the upcoming season. All teams use the offseason to get themselves into a place of contention so that they are hopefully the ones hoisting up the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season. Entering 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs are the team to beat following them winning back-to-back Super Bowl titles. Each other team is trying to knock them off the pedestal.Sometimes the smallest of moves that teams make can have the largest impact. Recently, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed former New York Giants wide receiver Sterling Sheppard to a contract, giving them more firepower entering the season. Tampa Bay is coming off an appearance in the divisional round and that club will be looking to push even further this season.Shepard has spent his entire career with the Giants so this will be a transition for him. He has been plagued by injuries over the last few seasons but did appear in 15 games for New York in 2023. However, he only caught 10 passes for 57 yards and one touchdown. The Giants were a disaster in 2023 so his lack of production isn't fully on him. Sterling is hoping for better results this season with the Buccaneers as he tries to reignite his career.His best year in the NFL came in 2018 when he posted 66 catches with 876 yards and four touchdowns. The career-high in touchdowns for Sterling is eight from his rookie season. He has shown the ability to be a productive and impactful receiver when given the chance on the field. Tampa Bay has some quality weapons to work with, but Sterling can fit in like another piece to the puzzle.Sterling will get to work with Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield, with whom he played at Oklahoma. The connection between the two players could pay off well for the Buccaneers, possibly giving them another strong dup to work around. Sterling will be looking to play his part on the team and possibly earn an even bigger contract next season.This will be a prove-it type year for the veteran wide receiver as he looks to raise his stock around the game. If he can be impactful, there will be plenty of teams knocking at his door next offseason. The former second-round wide receiver has plenty of talent to work with but needs to show more consistency throughout an entire season.", "summary": "A former second-round pick of the Giants has signed with another NFC team.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/former-giants-wr-signs-nfc-playoff-hopeful-1910091", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406374/sterling-shepard.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:00:02", "author": "Matt Levine", "authors": ["Matt Levine"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.173}

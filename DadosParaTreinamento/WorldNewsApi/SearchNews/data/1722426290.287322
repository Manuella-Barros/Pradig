(AP) \u2014 Zach Eflin worked six scoreless innings, Jose Siri homered twice and the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Washington Nationals 3-1 on Friday night. The Rays\u2019 Yandy D\u00edaz singled in the third inning to extend his hitting streak to a team-record 20 games, surpassing Jason Bartlett\u2019s mark set in 2009. Tampa Bay was the only team not to have a player with a 20-game hitting streak. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty awesome, pretty special,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash said. With the win, Tampa Bay improved to 41-41. The Rays haven\u2019t been over .500 since May 21. Washington slipped to 2-5 on a nine-game trip. Eflin (4-5) scattered four hits, struck out six and snapped a five-start winless streak. Pete Fairbanks, the third Rays\u2019 reliever, worked the ninth for his 13th save in 15 chances, closing out the five-hitter. \u201cI had a pretty bad bullpen pregame, so that means I was going to be pretty accurate in the game,\u201d Eflin said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it works for me.\u201d Siri had a solo homer in the second inning before Isaac Paredes added an RBI single that put the Rays up 2-0 in the third inning. Mitchell Parker (5-4) kept the Nationals close he when struck out Jos\u00e9 Caballero with the bases loaded to end the inning. Siri\u2019s second homer of the game and 11th of the season off Jacob Barnes in the sixth inning made it 3-0. Washington\u2019s Jacob Young got his second double of the game in the seventh, stole third for his 19th stolen base and scored on catcher Alex Jackosn\u2019s throwing error. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get anything going,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. Parker gave up two runs and six hits in five innings. The rookie left-hander has allowed three earned runs or less in 13 of 14 career starts. Nationals left fielder Jesse Winker left the game with a bruised knee after he caught his cleats on the turf, stumbled and fell hard to the ground at the wall while catching Paredes\u2019 fly to end the first. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt looked worse than it was. He made a nice play just to recover and catch the ball because when he started falling down I thought he\u2019s going to get hit in the head with the ball.\u201d Washington shortstop CJ Abrams stayed in the game after getting hit in the hand by a pitch in the first. Martinez said X-rays on Abrams were negative. TRAINER\u2019S ROOM Nationals: INF Joey Gallo (strained left hamstring) hit off a tee and continued his running progression. \u2026 RHP Josiah Gray (right elbow-forearm strain) could go seven innings or 90 pitches an his next start Sunday with Triple-A Rochester. Rays: 2B Brandon Lowe (broken right pinky toe) pinch hit in the seventh after missing four games. \u2026 LHP Jeffrey Springs (Tommy John surgery) gave up three runs in three innings and threw 48 pitches in his fourth start for Triple-A Durham. UP NEXT Nationals RHP Jake Irvin (5-6, 3.13 ERA) will pitch against Rays RHP Aaron Civale (2-5, 5.20 ERA) on Saturday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25hdGlvbmFscy1yYXlzLXNjb3JlLWIzN2FhZjQ4MzFjNzZjMzE4N2ZkZDU3NWY1YTc4ODQ00gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Zach Eflin works 6 scoreless innings, Jose Siri homers twice and the Rays beat the Nationals 3-1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/nationals-rays-score-b37aaf4831c76c3187fdd575f5a78844", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/8e4f83d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4408x2480+0+465/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd2%2F89%2F32af09c8731107828175b2da844f%2F9f5bad9ec8464a6d908960efef47c832", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:06:31", "author": "Mark Didtler", "authors": ["Mark Didtler"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.265}

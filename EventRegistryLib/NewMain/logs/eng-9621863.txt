The outlet claimed Gaga -- real name Stefani Angelina Germanotta -- \"was spotted with an apparent [baby] bump\" at her sister's rehearsal dinner.\n\nOne follower commented, \"My mother was QUICK with a response lol,\" while another added, \"I've never been so quick to a TikTok post, u ROCK Gaga.\"\n\nGaga is used to this kind of rampant speculation. Just recently, the singer sparked engagement rumors after she was spotted wearing a massive diamond ring on that finger while out and about in West Hollywood. The House of Gucci star is currently dating entrepreneur-investor Michael Polansky, whom she's been linked to since New Year's Eve 2019.\n\nET has reached out to Gaga's rep for comment on the engagement rumors.\n\nGaga was previously engaged to Taylor Kinney and Christian Carino. While she and Polansky have been linked since 2019, Gaga didn't make things Instagram official with him until the following year. They've maintained a relatively private romance in the years since.\n\nBack in February, a source told ET that Gaga and Polansky are \"together and going strong,\" adding that while they're not in a rush to take the next steps, they are \"content with where things are at.\"\n\nThe source also noted that the couple enjoyed a trip together, further strengthening their bond. Whether it's cozy date nights or simply enjoying each other's company in a low-key setting, Gaga and Polansky are described as \"very happy.\"\n\nET last spoke with Gaga less than two weeks ago at the premiere of her Gaga Chromatica Ball film, where she teased new music.\n\n\"I have been working on my new music all the time and I truly live and breathe it,\" Gaga said of her highly anticipated seventh studio album, which will follow 2020's Chromatica. \"I just can't wait to give it to the fans.\"\n\nOf the \"completely different project\" and when her little monsters can expect it, she added, \"They hate when I say, 'Soon,' but soon.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nLady Gaga Reveals She Had COVID While Performing 5 Shows\n\nLady Gaga Talks New Music, Reacts to Beyonc\u00e9 'Telephone' Sequel Rumors", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@9news.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poker Face (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Gucci", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Gucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hollywood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Hollywood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Hollywood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Kinney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Kinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.9news.com/assets/ETONLINE/images/2c7e1372-e9c6-4906-b82f-b114541c57e0/20240605T070735/2c7e1372-e9c6-4906-b82f-b114541c57e0_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out here right now who is going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me.\"\n\nFans had gone into overdrive on Monday when images obtained by The Sun showed the Poker Face performer at her sister Natali's wedding in Maine. Gaga was accompanied by her boyfriend, entrepreneur Michael Polansky, 46.\n\nIn the photos, the Bad Romance hitmaker was glowing alongside Michael, wearing a tight-fitting little black dress with an elegant off-shoulder design that highlighted her figure.\n\nShe completed her look with matching pumps and a string of pearls around her neck.At one point, Gaga appeared emotional, wiping away tears the day before her fashion designer sister's nuptials.\n\nOn Saturday, the actress, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, wore a peach-colored bridesmaid dress as she walked down the aisle with a groomsman.\n\nShe joined her family and loved ones at the ViewPoint Hotel, which they rented out entirely for the event, to witness her sister's marriage ceremony by the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDuring the wedding weekend, Gaga was also seen leaning against her partner, whom she has been dating for over four years, while taking photos.\n\nSparkling in the afternoon light was a massive diamond on her ring finger, further fueling speculation that she and Polansky might have taken the next step in their relationship.\n\nIn March 2021, reports suggested that Gaga's relationship with Polansky was getting serious, with the superstar expressing a desire to start a family.\n\nShe had previously opened up about her excitement to become a mother. In her May 2020 cover story with InStyle, Gaga admitted, \"I look forward to being a mom. Isn't it incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it. Then it comes out, and it's our job to keep it alive.\"\n\nGaga and Polansky, a Harvard University graduate and executive at the Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and The Parker Foundation, first sparked romance rumors in 2020.\n\nThey confirmed their relationship after being seen kissing and celebrating New Year's together. In February of that year, they went Instagram official with a cozy photo of them cuddling on a boat in Miami.\n\nBefore Polansky, Gaga was engaged twice -- first to Taylor Kinney, before they broke off their engagement in July 2016, and then to her talent manager Christian Carino, with whom she split in February 2019.\n\nThe last public sighting of Gaga and Polansky together was in April in Malibu. At the end of the month, Gaga was seen bundled up in an oversized sweatshirt with long sleeves, which she used to conceal her left hand amid engagement rumors. The private couple made a rare appearance to enjoy a game of tennis together before stepping out for a low-key dinner date at Nobu.\n\nGaga recently wrapped up filming for her upcoming movie Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and continues to work on a new album.

have so far been unavailable for comment.\n\nIn photos from her sister's wedding obtained by The Sun, the Bad Romance hitmaker was glowing alongside her boyfriend Michael while modeling a tight-fitting little black dress with an elegant, off-shoulder style to highlight her figure.\n\nTo complete her look, she sported matching pumps and a string of pearls on her neck.\n\nAt one point, she appeared to be getting emotional and wiping away tears the day before her fashion designer sister's nuptials.\n\nOn Saturday, the actress, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, wore a peach-colored bridesmaid dress as she walked down the aisle with a groomsman.\n\nGaga's most recent appearance was on May 23 when she attended the premiere of HBO's Gaga Chromatica Ball in West

together.\n\nPrior to dating Polansky, Gaga was engaged twice before, first to Taylor Kinney before they broke off their engagement in July 2016 and then to her talent manager, Christian Carino, before the pair called it quits in February 2019.\n\nThe last time she was spotted out in public with Polansky was in April in Malibu.\n\nOver the weekend, Gaga joined her mother and father, Cynthia and Joe Germanotta, to celebrate her younger sister Natali Germanotta tying the knot; seen in September 2017\n\nAt the end of the month, Gaga bundled up in an oversize sweatshirt with long sleeves, which she used to conceal her left hand amid rumors that the pair had gotten engaged.\n\nThe private couple made a rare appearance to enjoy a game of tennis together before they stepped out for a

The Just Dance hitmaker, 38, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, wowed in a peach-colored bridesmaid dress and matching sheer gloves while holding onto yellow flowers. She joined her family and their loved ones at the ViewPoint Hotel, which they rented out entirely for the event, to watch her fashion designer sister get married in front of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nGaga and Michael put on a loved-up display as they walked arm-in-arm around the picturesque venue. The day prior at the rehearsal dinner, Gaga sparked pregnancy rumors after stepping out in a tight-fitting little black dress. Gaga is denying rumors that she's pregnant with her and her boyfriend Michael's first child.\n\nOn Tuesday, the multi-Grammy Award-winning singer took to TikTok to directly shutdown the online chatter. 'Not pregnant - just down bad cryin at the gym,' captioned Gaga, who was partially quoting lyrics to pop rival Taylor Swift 's song Down Bad. The expression 'Down bad' is mostly used to refer to feelings of longing and sadness. She then encouraged her 9.3million followers to 'register to vote.'\n\nGaga recorded a brief video of herself from the chest up that showed her in the midst of getting her hair and makeup done. Wearing a nude wig cap and bold black eyeliner, she lip-synced the viral TikTok audio: 'I don't have to find an aesthetic, I am an aesthetic. I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out here right now who is going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me.'\n\nFans went into overdrive on Monday after she was pictured with boyfriend Michael at the lavish wedding. 'Lady Gaga randomly being pregnant and married,' one excited fan wrote, while others rushed to congratulate her. In the photos, the Bad Romance hitmaker was glowing alongside Michael while modeling a tight-fitting little black dress with an elegant, off-shoulder style to highlight her figure.\n\nTo complete her look, she sported matching pumps and a string of pearls on her neck. At one point, she appeared to be getting emotional and wiping away tears the day before her fashion designer sister's nuptials. She also leaned up against her partner -- whom she has been dating for over four years now -- while taking photos during the wedding weekend.\n\nSparkling in the afternoon light was also a massive diamond on her ring finger -- also fueling speculation that she and the entrepreneur might have made the next step in their relationship. Back in March 2021, it was reported that Gaga's romance with Polansky was getting serious and she had expressed the desire to start a family with him. 'She has been telling her friends that she wants to get through a few projects and then focus on settling down,' a source told Entertainment Tonight at the time. 'Gaga wants to have children one day and sees a future with Michael.'\n\nThe superstar had also previously opened up about her desire to become a mother. For her May 2020 cover story with InStyle, Gaga admitted that she is 'very excited to have kids.' 'I look forward to being a mom,' she said. 'Isn't it incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it. Then it comes out, and it's our job to keep it alive.'\n\nThe actress was first romantically linked to Polansky, who is a graduate of Harvard University and works as an executive at the Institude for Cancer Immunotherapy and The Parker Foundation, in 2020. They confirmed their romance when they were seen kissing and celebrating New Year's together that year. That February, the pair went Instagram official when Gaga shared a photo of them cuddling on a boat in Miami together. Prior to dating Polansky, Gaga was engaged twice before, first to Taylor Kinney before they broke off their engagement in July 2016 and then to her talent manager, Christian Carino, before the pair called it quits in February 2019.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

I have written so many songs, I've been producing so many songs, and it's nothing like anything that I've ever made before,\" she said. \"I love to break genre, and I love to explore music,\" she added, as reported by People.\n\nFans can look forward to fresh and innovative music from Gaga as she continues to push the boundaries of her artistic expression.", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "appteam@liveindia.tv", "name": "appteam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Bad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Down Bad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Close-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Kinney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Kinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://liveindia.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lady-Gaga.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Singer Answers 'Baby Bump' Questions", "body": "In the past, Lady Gaga has shared troubling health news with fans. It is not unreasonable that some hoped that she might have a more positive announcement for the world.\n\nOver the weekend, some busybodies (well-intentioned or otherwise) thought they spied a possible baby bump.\n\nNow, Lady Gaga herself is responding - with Taylor Swift's help!\n\nLate on Tuesday, June 4, the incomparable Lady Gaga took to TikTok to address fans.\n\nShe didn't hesitate to delve directly into the pregnancy rumors that had emerged.\n\n\"Not pregnant,\" she began -- not even touching upon the speculation before debunking it.\n\nInstead, the phenomenal musician explained, she was: \"Just down bad cryin' at the gym.\"\n\nIf you didn't catch the reference, Lady Gaga was pulling from the lyrics to \"Down Bad\" from Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department album.\n\nWithin the video itself, Lady Gaga flashed a smile. Despite her makeup, she definitely looked dress for the gym.\n\nTikTok commenters flooded Lady Gaga's replies with reassurances and affirmations.\n\n\"People can be so mean. You are gorgeous Gaga. We love you!\" assured one commenter.\n\nAnother accurately described the singer, writing: \"You are perfect.\"\n\nNot all speculation is harmful. In fact, many celebrities -- including Lady Gaga -- have and continue to use fan speculation as a positive PR strategy.\n\nFor example, amidst the hurtful \"baby bump\" buzz, fans also spied Lady Gaga's large diamond ring. This fueled speculation about a Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky engagement, though this remains unconfirmed.\n\nBut whispers about a relationship status getting a little more serious are a far cry from discussing someone's body. We all hate to think that press coverage of Gaga's visit to sister Natali Germonotta's rehearsal dinner prompted the singer to feel that she needed to change her body.\n\nThough Gaga was quick to address the pregnancy rumors, neither she nor Polansky have confirmed (or denied) whether they are currently engaged.\n\nHowever, the two first became romantically linked in the public eye back in early 2020.\n\nGaga has had two engagements in the past. Neither worked out. Fans hope that, no matter her relationship status at the moment, that the beloved talent can find happiness.\n\nLady Gaga is no stranger to making sensible political statements. Her TikTok debunking the baby bump rumors was no exception.\n\nShe followed up her clarification by writing: \"Register to vote at www.headcount.org\" on her video.\n\n2024 is an election year. While it would be so nice for there to be an election year that \"doesn't matter,\" that has yet to happen in any of our lifetimes. Gaga is right: we all have to do our part.\n\nAs Instagram bloggers quickly documented, Taylor Swift chimed in to discuss the creepy fixation on Lady Gaga's body that led to this reaction.\n\n\"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body,\" Taylor Swift wrote. \"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\"\n\nShe's very correct. Whether or not a person is actually pregnant, it's unclear why people feel the need to speculate. And it's even worse than many feel entitled to answers.

Inside their very low key relationship - he is a businessman and entrepreneur who holds several roles among not-for-profit organisations and other companies, Polansky helped create the Parker Foundation\n\nIn addition to his work at the foundation, Polansky is a board member of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, which funds research for cancer treatments\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Polansky attended Harvard University between 2002 and 2006 - and graduated from the prestigious American university with a degree in applied mathematics and computer science.\n\nA businessman and entrepreneur who holds several roles among not-for-profit organisations and other companies, Polansky helped create the Parker Foundation in 2015 alongside Sean Parker, the co-founder of Facebook and Napster.\n\nThe Parker Foundation seeks to create positive changes in global public health, life sciences and civic engagement.\n\nIn addition to his work at the foundation, Polansky is a board member of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, which funds research for cancer treatments.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Michael and Lady Gaga first bonded over a shared 'focus' on charity, with the singer being a vocal advocate for the mental health and wellness of young people after founding the Born This Way Foundation.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC's Morning Joe, the singer also mentioned that Michael had been putting his tech-savvy skills to good use by helping her develop an app for the foundation.\n\n'With Born This Way Foundation, my mother, Cynthia Germanotta, and our co-founder Maya [Enista Smith], who I love so very much -- they are working with my, the love of my life on something for mental health,' Gaga revealed.\n\nHow did Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky meet?\n\nBack in March 2021, it was reported that Gaga's romance with Polansky was heating up and she had expressed the desire to start a family with him\n\nAccording to Page Six, Gaga and Polansky have 'known each other for a while through events Parker has hosted at his LA mansion.'\n\nSpeaking to the publication in 2020, an inside source claimed that the couple connected at Parker's birthday party in December 2019.\n\nThe couple were then seen kissing and celebrating New Year's together in 2020.\n\nThat February, the pair went Instagram official when Gaga shared a photo of them cuddling on a boat in Miami together.\n\nIn March 2021, it was reported that Gaga's romance with Polansky was getting serious and she had expressed the desire to start a family with him.\n\n'She has been telling her friends that she wants to get through a few projects and then focus on settling down,' a source told Entertainment Tonight at the time.\n\nPrior to dating Polansky, Gaga was engaged twice before, first to Taylor Kinney before they broke off their engagement in July 2016 and then to her talent manager, Christian Carino, before the pair called it quits in February 2019.\n\nThe last time she was spotted out in public with Polansky was in April in Malibu.\n\nAt the end of the month, Gaga bundled up in an oversize sweatshirt with long sleeves, which she used to conceal her left hand amid rumors that the pair had gotten engaged.\n\nThe private couple made a rare appearance to enjoy a game of tennis together before they stepped out for a low-key dinner date at Nobu.\n\nFor their evening outing, Gaga wrapped herself up in a black leather oversized blazer.\n\nThe pregnancy rumors come just weeks before she is expected to be kicking off her eight-date Las Vegas jazz and piano residency.\n\nLady Gaga and Michael Polansky are seen in Midtown on October 22, 2023 in New York City", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

She leaned into that reality on Chromatica's \"Babylon,\" where she vogues through her ongoing experience of people spreading fake gossip -- or \"babbling on\" -- about her personal life. Now, she's denying rumors like a tortured poet. After a few new photos of the singer went viral on social media, fans began speculating that she's pregnant. But the gossip disappeared as soon as quickly as it started after Gaga shut down the hearsay by referencing a fellow pop star who's used to the rumor mill, Taylor Swift.\n\nOn June 4, Gaga addressed the pregnancy rumors on TikTok. \"Not pregnant. Just down bad cryin' at the gym,\" she wrote on the video, nodding to the chorus of Swift's Tortured Poets Department track \"Down Bad.\" Gaga also used this moment to encourage fans to \"register to vote at www.headcount.org\" ahead of this year's election. She later shared the same caption with a different video on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe pregnancy speculation began on June 3, when photos of Gaga attending her sister's wedding in Maine appeared on X. According to The Sun, the singer -- who was her sister's maid of honor -- also enjoyed the festivities with longtime boyfriend, Michael Polansky.\n\nEven before Gaga posted her TikTok, fans immediately denounced the rumors on her behalf and noted that people should stop speaking on women's bodies. Swift agreed, and left a similar comment on Gaga's TikTok video on June 5. \"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body. Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman,\" she wrote with a kissing emoji.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gaga and Swift have publicly supported each other. In January 2023, the Fame Monster singer praised Swift for talking about her self-love journey while dealing with an eating disorder in her 2020 Miss Americana documentary.\n\nAs for the all the unsubstantiated rumors, this isn't the first time Gaga has been the center of unconfirmed gossip this year. In April, fans speculated that Gaga and Polansky -- who've been dating since late 2019 -- were secretly engaged. The singer hasn't addressed the hearsay; however, considering she's back in her Chromatica era, it would be iconic to see her respond with a TikTok lip-sync of \"Babylon.\"", "source": {"uri": "elitedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Elite Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babylon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(Shawn_Mendes_and_Justin_Bieber_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monster (Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/5/8ddfcd00/us-actress-singer-lady.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.6589&fp-y=0.467", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 551, "textEnd": 557}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1001, "textEnd": 1007}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 1448, "textEnd": 1454}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Gaga refused to let all that publicity go to waste, adding on screen, \"register to vote at www.headcount.org.\"\n\nShe added another call to action in the caption, but that seems to have gone over the heads of the thousands of followers who were more keyed into Gaga's word choice. \"GAGA AND TAYLOR??? OMG\" reads one comment, referring to the pop star's use of Taylor Swift lyrics. (\"Down bad crying at the gym,\" for the uninitiated, is a line from Swift's \"Down Bad,\" a track off The Tortured Poets Department.)\n\nThe rest of the comments echoed the \"omg\" sentiment, as though they never fathomed that Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift could exist in the same universe. \"Girls give us a duet,\" wrote one follower. And another, \"GAGA BEING A SWIFTIE WELL WE NEED A COLLAB IMMEDIATELY.\"\n\nOne element of the rumor that Gaga did not address was the speculation that she is engaged to her partner of four years, Michael Polansky. Also at the wedding, Gaga was photographed wearing a large, oval-shaped rock on her left ring finger. Perhaps she's just doing the polite thing and waiting for her sister's moment to pass before announcing her own impending nuptials? Or maybe Gaga is just a girl who likes to wear a ring on her left hand when it pleases her. She is an enigma.\n\nLady Gaga and Michael Polansky went Instagram official in 2020, though they've largely flown under the radar ever since. According to his LinkedIn profile, Polansky is a Harvard grad with a degree in computer science and applied mathematics who is a founder and investor in several companies.", "source": {"uri": "glamour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamour.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treadmill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treadmill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMG_(Usher_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OMG (Usher song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applied mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/66608e66e84f9ffa93ed1f6b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/MixCollage-05-Jun-2024-12-12-PM-2918.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 246, "textEnd": 252}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The Joker 2 star sparked rumours that she was pregnant after she attended her sister Natali Germanotta's rehearsal dinner ahead of her wedding in York. Fans spotted an alleged baby bump and soon, speculations arose that Lady Gaga was expecting her first baby with Michael Polansky. However, the singer has clarified that the rumours are not true.\n\nThe Bad Romance hitmaker shared a video on TikTok and took some help from Taylor Swift to shut down rumours. Borrowing a line from Taylor Swift's Down Bad, Gaga wrote, \"Not pregnant-just down bad cryin at the gym.\" She lip-synced the lines, \"I don't have to find an aesthetic. I am an aesthetic. I mean I'm sure there's somebody out here right now who's going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me.\"\n\nShe completed the post by adding the link where people could register to vote.

The performance prompted weeks of speculation, statements, jokes and certainly tears, cementing it as one for the history books.\n\nOriginally made in 1937, the story of A Star Is Born follows an aspiring Hollywood actress being \"discovered\" by an older, more successful actress. The pair fall in love and as her star rises, his starts to dim, and the story follows the strain this places on their relationship.\n\nA riff on the same story has been explored in subsequent 1954 and 1976 films. In 2018, Bradley Cooper directed a modern take, starring as famous singer Jackson Maine who discovers down-on-her-luck ingenue Ally, played by Lady Gaga.\n\nThe film was a commercial and critical success. It's titular song Shallow was featured on the soundtrack and became a chart-topping hit in its own right.\n\nDue to their deep and intense chemistry throughout the film, speculation of an affair between Cooper and Lady Gaga sprouted as soon as it was released.\n\nDuring the press tour, the two shared details on their \"instant chemistry\" with Vogue. \"She had her hair slicked back and she sang La Vie en Rose, and I was just... levitating. It shot like a diamond through my brain. I loved the way she moved, the sound of her voice,\" Cooper said.\n\nREAD MORE: Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's relationship timeline\n\nIn turn, Gaga said, \"The second that I saw him, I was like, 'Have I known you my whole life?' It was an instant connection, instant understanding of one another.\"\n\nThe pair also bonded over their shared Italian heritage.\n\nLady Gaga famously (and somewhat hilariously) gushed about how Bradley Cooper was the \"one person in the room\" who believed in her at every appearance. Cooper gushed about how Gaga gave him the confidence to sing.\n\nThen, at the 2019 Oscars, Cooper and Gaga performed their hit song Shallow which had been nominated (and won) at the awards for Best Original Song.\n\nEvoking Jackson and Ally, the two stared at each other the entire time and the song crackled with emotion. Cooper even sat down next to Gaga on the piano bench and their cheeks touched as they belted out \"in the sha-sha-sha-la-la-low\".\n\nMany were touched but some also thought the performance was \"uncomfortable\", considering Cooper's partner Iryna Shayk was in the front row watching. It didn't help that Gaga broke up with her Hollywood agent fiance that same month.\n\nWith the rumours at fever pitch, Lady Gaga appeared on Jimmy Kimmel to discuss the Oscar win for Best Original Song.\n\nKimmel asked about the steamy performance. \"We were watching it at home going, 'What is going on with these two?!',\" he said. \"People were saying they must be in love.\"\n\nGaga rolled her eyes and brushed it off as nothing more than great acting.\n\n\"People saw love and guess what? That's what we wanted you to see,\" she said, explaining that Bradley Cooper directed the entire performance - from lighting to set up to shooting to him sitting next to Gaga on the bench.\n\n\"From a performance perspective, it was so important to both of us that we were connected the whole time,\" she continued.\n\n\"I'm an artist and I guess we did a good job. Fooled ya!\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'This is not a joke': The catastrophic Oscars blunder that unfolded in front of millions\n\nHowever, later that year, Cooper also broke up with long-term partner Shayk, leading many to think he would finally unite with Gaga.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone in the world, nothing seemed to happen.\n\nCooper didn't address the accusations himself until years later.

Her ensemble was accentuated by a massive diamond ring, a pearl necklace, and matching earrings.\n\nHer makeup was flawlessly executed, featuring a bright red lip and subtle brown eyeshadow. She appeared to be in high spirits, laughing with other wedding guests and gazing out at the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe following day, the star looked radiant as she assisted her sister with her stunning white wedding dress.\n\nGaga, who served as Maid of Honor, styled her blonde hair in an elegant bun adorned with pink flowers. She wore a light peach dress with matching arm-length gloves while holding a bouquet of yellow flowers.\n\nAfter the 30-minute ceremony, Lady Gaga was seen conversing with Michael, 46, who looked dapper in a black suit with a floral boutonni\u00e8re.\n\nThe couple walked arm-in-arm down to the shore to take photos with the newlyweds, radiating happiness and togetherness.\n\nThe Oscar winner has confirmed, whenever asked in interviews, that she definitely wants to have children. She told InStyle in 2020: \"I will say I am very excited to have kids.\"\n\nEarly on in the star's career in 2010, Gaga, then 24, made it clear that while one day she wanted children, that day was very far off.\n\nResponding to a question from Larry King, she said: \"Yes, some day. Although my womb is not yet beckoning for a child. I'm very far away from that day. I'm also terrified it will ruin my creativity.\"\n\n\"Forget it. It won't\", King reassured the Just Dance singer.\n\nGaga similarly affirmed to The Insider just two years later that she wanted children \"someday\", but \"[That will happen] a long, long day from now. Not soon. My baby will be my new record.\"\n\nSpeaking to InStyle, Gaga expressed how excited she was to have kids. She said about pregnancy: \"I look forward to being a mom. Isn't it incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it.\n\n\"Then it comes out, and it's our job to keep it alive. It's so funny -- everyone works out of my house every day. When they come in, I always say, 'Welcome to the Womb!'\"\n\nBefore Michael, one of Lady Gaga's most notable past relationships was with actor Taylor Kinney, known for his role in the hit TV drama Chicago Fire.\n\nThe two met on the set of Gaga's music video for You and I in 2011.\n\nInitially, they kept their relationship under wraps, making their red carpet debut at the Golden Globes after-party in 2014.

The \"A Star Is Born\" singer wore a form-fitting black dress to the rehearsal dinner, which some said displayed a bump, and then wore a free-flowing dress that hid her stomach as bridesmaid on her sister's big day.\n\nIn response, Gaga captioned her TikTok video with \"Not pregnant -- Just down bad cryin' at the gym.\"\n\nThe caption references Taylor Swift's newest hit, \"Down Bad,\" off of her April album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nWith that, Taylor Swift came out and defended Lady Gaga -- and remind everyone that it's never appropriate to talk about a women's body or postulate about a woman's pregnancy.\n\n\"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body,\" Swift wrote in response to Gaga's most recent TikTok post, which denied the rumors. \"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\"\n\nIn a way, Swift's response to the video was also her speaking for herself. In recent weeks, the \"Fortnight\" singer has faced similar pregnancy rumors as her relationship with football star Travis Kelce smolders, with speculators posting pictures of her stomach not being perfectly flat every second of every day.\n\nGaga has been dating beau and entrepreneur Michael Polansky since 2020 and has been seen with a pretty giant diamond ring on her left hand recently.\n\nThis is not the first time that the two singers have shown support for each other. After Swift's documentary came out in 2020, Gaga shared that it was brave of Taylor to discuss her eating disorder.

How many celebrities have had to deal with strangers openly discussing their bodies and their reproductive decisions? Lady Gaga is the most recent celebrity to be caught up in this cycle, and she decided to address the rumors in a way that worked for her. By quoting Taylor Swift, and reminding people to vote. Because she is Lady Gaga and she gets to do whatever she wants.\n\nRumors about \"The Shallows\" singer began after photos of her attending her sister Natali Germanotta's wedding last month circulated online. In the photos, the singer was seen in a black dress with her hands somewhere near her stomach and, apparently, that was enough for the social media rumor mill to go wild with speculation that she was expecting her first child.\n\nFor several weeks, Gaga, who has been in a relationship with Michael Polansky since 2020, ignored the rumors and just lived her life as she has always done. But on Tuesday, she decided to go ahead and address them.\n\n\"Not pregnant -- just down bad cryin' at the gym register to vote at www.headcount.org,\" Gaga captioned a TikTok video that has since obviously gone viral, mouthing along to an audio that said, \"I don't have to find an aesthetic; I am the aesthetic. I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out here right now who is going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me.\" Taylor Swift fans will know that \"down bad cryin' at the gym\" is a reference to Swift's song \"Down Bad\" from her Tortured Poets Department album.\n\nPerhaps even better, Gaga used that unsubstantiated rumor to get out the vote, which she also did on Twitter. \"Not pregnant... REGISTER TO VOTE or check if you've already registered EASILY at http://headcount.org.\"\n\nLady Gaga did open up in 2020 that she is \"excited\" to become a mom someday, telling InStyle at the time, \"I will say I am very excited to have kids. I look forward to being a mom,\" the 38-year-old singer told the magazine. \"Isn't incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it. Then it comes out, and it's our job to keep it alive. It's so funny -- everyone works out of my house every day.

The 38-year-old singer showed off what appeared to be a baby bump and a large diamond ring at the rehearsal dinner for her sister Natali Germanotta's wedding in York, Maine.\n\nThe singer has been maintaining a low profile in recent months following the completion of filming for her upcoming movie \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\" and as she continues to work on a brand new album. She made only one public appearance recently at the premiere of her HBO concert film \"Gaga Chromatica Ball,\" where she wore a car part to cover her midsection.\n\nPregnant? Really?\n\nIn photos from her sister's wedding published by The Sun, the singer of \"Bad Romance\" looked radiant alongside her boyfriend Michael Polansky, 46. She wore a form-fitting little black dress with an elegant, off-shoulder style that accentuated her figure.\n\nTo complete her ensemble, she wore matching pumps and a string of pearls around her neck. At one point, she appeared to become emotional, wiping away tears the day before her fashion designer sister's wedding.\n\nOn Saturday, the actress, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, donned a peach-colored bridesmaid dress as she walked down the aisle with a groomsman.\n\nShe joined her family and their close ones at the ViewPoint Hotel, which they had rented out entirely for the occasion, to witness her sister's wedding overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThroughout the wedding weekend, she leaned against her partner -- with whom she has been in a relationship for more than four years -- while posing for photos.\n\nAlso catching the afternoon light was a large diamond ring on her ring finger -- adding to speculation that she and the entrepreneur may have taken the next step in their relationship.\n\nDeja Vu\n\nIn March 2021, reports indicated that Gaga's relationship with Polansky was becoming more serious, and she had expressed a desire to start a family with him.\n\nAccording to a source who spoke with Entertainment Tonight at the time, \"She has been telling her friends that she wants to complete a few projects and then concentrate on settling down.\"\n\n\"Gaga wants to have children one day and sees a future with Michael.\"\n\nThe superstar had previously discussed her desire to become a mother. In her May 2020 cover story with InStyle, Gaga admitted that she is 'very excited to have kids.'\n\n\"I look forward to being a mom,\" she said. \"Isn't it incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it. Then it comes out, and it's our job to keep it alive\"\n\nThe actress was first linked romantically to Polansky, a Harvard University graduate who works as an executive at the Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and The Parker Foundation, in 2020.\n\nThey confirmed their relationship when they were photographed kissing and celebrating New Year's together that year.\n\nIn February, the couple made their relationship public on Instagram when Gaga posted a photo of them cuddling on a boat in Miami.\n\nBefore dating Polansky, Gaga had been engaged twice. Her first engagement was to Taylor Kinney, which ended in July 2016, and she was also engaged to her talent manager, Christian Carino, before they split in February 2019.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

Department song Down Bad to squash speculation.\n\n\"not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym,\" Gaga wrote atop a selfie video.\n\nThe Oscar-winner took the opportunity while denying reports to encourage people to register to vote in the upcoming US presidential election, which is being held in November.\n\nIt is not mandatory for Americans to vote in elections.\n\n\"register to vote or check if you're registered EASILY at www.headcount.org,\" Gaga, who has openly endorsed Joe Biden, captioned the clip.\n\nElsewhere, eagle-eyed fans also spotted a large diamond ring on Gaga's engagement finger in paparazzi photos from her sister's nuptials, leading many to believe she's set to wed to her long-time boyfriend Michael Polansky, who she's been dating for four years.\n\nHowever, the songwriter didn't address speculation she was engaged.\n\nWhile she's kept busy in recent years, Gaga hasn't released an album since 2020's Chromatica, which then saw her embark on a 20-show tour in 2022.\n\nAfter making her feature film debut in 2018's A Star is Born, in which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, Gaga then featured in 2021's House of Gucci.\n\nShe also helped legendary composer Hans Zimmer compose the score for 2022's box office blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick, and loaned her vocals for the film's original song, Hold My Hand.\n\nAddressing her time away from the public in an open letter to fans last June, Gaga said she'd become more \"private\" in a bid to recharge.\n\n\"I can say for the first time in many years that my love of making art, music, fashion, and supporting community has never been more fulfilling,\" Gaga wrote.\n\nShe continued, \"I hope you know this time to myself has been extremely healing and recharging for my heart, mind, body, and creativity -- to create within myself and to have a personal life that's just for me.\n\n\"I'm sure that may feel different because I haven't always been so private (I bet that will make some of you laugh) -- but I LOVE my fans, my little monsters, so much and that will never change.\"\n\nGaga is finally set to make her return to the big screen in the hugely-anticipated Joker sequel, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, in which she plays the iconic character of Harley Quinn, opposite Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips' follow-up to the Oscar-winning debut film in 2019 will hit cinemas this year.\n\nIn her open letter, Gaga explained how all-consuming the production was.\n\n\"I prepared for months developing my character for 'Joker,' I filmed

Accompanying her was long-term partner and entrepreneur Michael Polansky (46). The couple has been together for over four years and in the past few months, they have maintained a low profile.\n\nAt her sister Natali's wedding, Gaga was seen in an elegant off-shoulder black dress, matching pumps, and a string of pearls. She appeared emotional, wiping away tears the day before the nuptials. On the wedding day, she wore a peach-colored bridesmaid dress and walked down the aisle with a groomsman. The ceremony took place at the ViewPoint Hotel which was rented out entirely for the event.\n\nAdding to the speculation, Gaga was seen wearing a large diamond ring at the event, stirring rumors of a possible engagement with Polansky. Before this, another notable incident happened in April when the songstress was spotted wearing a dazzling diamond ring. The sparkle of the ring, peeking out from beneath Gaga's coat, caught everyone's eye. Soon after that, fans took to X to express their excitement and curiosity, with a user saying, \"Gurll, are u engaged??\" alongside crying emojis.\n\nReports from March 2021 suggested that Gaga's relationship with Polansky was becoming \"serious,\" and she had expressed a desire to start a family. A source told ET, \"She has been telling her friends that she wants to get through a few projects and then focus on settling down.\" In an InStyle cover story in 2020, Gaga stated, \"I look forward to being a mom.

On Tuesday, Gaga, 38, posted a video on TikTok addressing the speculation with the caption, \"not pregnant -- just down bad crying at the gym,\" a nod to a lyric from Swift's song \"Down Bad\" off her latest album, \"Tortured Poets Department.\" In the same post, Gaga encouraged her followers to register to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nSwift Stands Up Against Body Comments\n\nSwift, 34, commented on Gaga's TikTok, emphasizing the importance of respecting women's privacy. \"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body,\" she wrote. \"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\" She ended her supportive message with a kiss emoji, drawing praise from fans for her stance.\n\nGaga also took to her Instagram story, reiterating her message with a video captioned, \"Not pregnant.... REGISTER TO VOTE or check if you've already registered.\" The rumors began after paparazzi photos showed Gaga at her sister's wedding with her partner, Michael Polanski, fueling baseless speculation.\n\nIn her TikTok video, Gaga aimed to dispel the rumors, but Swift's comment received significant attention, with many users applauding her message and celebrating the friendship between the two pop icons.\n\nLady Gaga's New Role and Swift's Own Rumors\n\nWhile addressing the rumors, Gaga is also gearing up for a major role in the upcoming film Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, where she stars opposite Joaquin Phoenix as Harley Quinn. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Gaga teased her portrayal of the iconic character. \"You know my version of Harley is mine, and it's very authentic to this movie and these characters,\" she shared. \"I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor Swift has been the subject of pregnancy rumors herself, sparked by footage from her Eras tour. Some fans speculated that she might be expecting her first child with NFL star Travis Kelce, 34. The couple, who started dating last summer, made their relationship public during the NFL season, with Swift frequently attending Kansas City Chiefs games to support Kelce. Despite the rumors, Swift has not directly addressed them.\n\nIn a 2020 interview with Variety, Swift opened up about her experiences with body image and how early pregnancy rumors affected her. \"I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,\" she recalled. \"And the headline was like 'Pregnant at 18?' And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat. So I just registered that as a punishment.\"\n\nSwift continued, explaining how these experiences shaped her relationship with her body. \"And then I'd walk into a photo shoot and be in the dressing room and somebody who worked at a magazine would say, 'Oh, wow, this is so amazing that you can fit into the sample sizes. Usually, we have to make alterations to the dresses, but we can take them right off the runway and put them on you!' And I looked at that as a pat on the head.\"\n\nSwift concluded by reflecting on the impact of such comments. \"You register that enough times, and you just start to accommodate everything towards praise and punishment, including your own body,\" she said.\n\nBoth Swift and Gaga continue to use their platforms to speak out against body shaming and promote positive messages, reinforcing the need for respect and understanding in discussions about women's bodies.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Polanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body image"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Taylor-Swift-backs-Lady-Gaga-after-invasive-pregnancy-rumors-are-shut-down.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nTaylor Swift knows the power of her words, and she used them to make an important and much-needed statement after Lady Gaga posted a TikTok to shut down pregnancy rumors. The Sun had run photos of Gaga at her sister's wedding over the weekend, headlining its piece, \"Lady Gaga sparks pregnancy rumors after being spotted with bump at sister's wedding with partner Michael Polansky.\" Online comments flurried after the photos were published on social media.\n\nGaga made a very unusual move, posting pregnancy denials on both TikTok and Instagram.\n\nOn TikTok, Gaga wrote, \"not pregnant -- just down bad crying at the gym. Register to vote at www.headcount.org.\" Her caption references the lyrics of Swift's The Tortured Poets Department song \"Down Bad.\"\n\nSwift left a comment on the video that has since gone viral. She wrote, \"Can we all agree that it's invasive and irresponsible to comment on a woman's body. Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation, and neither does any woman. \ud83d\udc8b\"\n\nGaga and Swift aren't the only stars to address commentary around women's bodies and how toxic it is. Hailey Bieber spoke to GQ in October about being the constant subject of pregnancy rumors. \"Recently, everybody was like, 'Oh, my God, she's pregnant,' and that's happened to me multiple times before,\" she said. \"There is something that's disheartening about, Damn, I can't be bloated one time and not be pregnant? It would be a lie if I was like, Oh, yeah, I don't give a shit. When there comes a day that that is true, you -- you, as in the internet, will be the last to know.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston also touched on how difficult it was for her in a November 2022 Allure interview, sharing that she had been struggling privately with infertility in her late 30s and 40s. \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard,\" she said. \"I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would've given anything if someone had said to me, 'Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.' You just don't think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.\"\n\n\"I have zero regrets,\" she added. \"I actually feel a little relief now because there is no more, 'Can I? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.' I don't have to think about that anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "elle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Bieber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allure_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allure (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-lady-gaga-gettyimages-2154395351-66609ee42ab2d.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Gaga, glowing beside her boyfriend, wore a tight-fitting, off-shoulder black dress that accentuated her figure, paired with matching pumps and a string of pearls.\n\nAdding to the buzz was a large diamond on her ring finger, sparking rumours that she and Polansky might have taken their relationship to the next level.\n\nIn March 2021, it was reported that Gaga's relationship with Polansky was becoming serious, and she had expressed a desire to start a family with him. Gaga and Polansky, a Harvard graduate and executive at the Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and The Parker Foundation, were first linked romantically in 2020.\n\nThe couple confirmed their relationship when they were seen kissing and celebrating New Year's together.

Couldn't agree more.\n\nRumors about a Gaga pregnancy began circulating after the internet got hold of pictures of the pop star at her sister's wedding in which she seemed to be covering her stomach. But Gaga brushed it off, posting a TikTok on which she wrote, \"not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym,\" a reference to Swift's song \"Down Bad\" from her latest album. Funnily enough, on another Tortured Poets Department track, Swift mocks the constant pregnancy rumors with the line, \"I'm having his baby, no I'm not, but you should see your faces.\"\n\nBecause she's Lady Gaga, she also used the attention to tell everyone to make sure they're registered to vote.\n\nTaylor Swift herself commented on the video, not to reassure Gaga, who seems happy and confident, but to urge everyone to quit picking apart everyone's appearance. \"can we all agree that its invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body. Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\"\n\nSwift has previously revealed how body scrutiny, and in particular pregnancy rumors, have affected her mental health and triggered an eating disorder (something Gaga's dealt with, too). In the documentary Miss Americana, Swift explains that she tries not to look at photos of herself every day, because in the past, there were times when she saw, \"a picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or...someone said that I looked pregnant...and that'll just trigger me to just starve a little bit -- just stop eating.\"", "source": {"uri": "glamour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamour.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6660a09bf1a12f71b43a1dc0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gaga%20swift.png?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

People speculated that she had a baby bump after she wore a slim black dress. She was her sister's maid of honor, per The Sun. She was walking with her partner Michael Polansky and was sporting a big diamond ring.\n\nPolansky has been very supportive of their relationship and is frequently seen in Gaga's Instagrams.

paparazzi photos taken of Gaga at her sister Natali Germanotta's wedding in the seaside town of Maine at the weekend.\n\nTaking to TikTok Wednesday, the actress quoted lyrics from Taylor Swift's new The Tortured Poets Department song Down Bad to squash speculation.\n\n\"not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym,\" Gaga wrote atop a selfie video.\n\nThe Oscar-winner took the opportunity while denying reports to encourage people to register to vote in the upcoming US presidential election, which is being held in November.\n\nIt is not mandatory for Americans to vote in elections.\n\n\"register to vote or check if you're registered EASILY at www.headcount.org,\" Gaga, who has openly endorsed Joe Biden, captioned the clip.\n\nElsewhere, eagle-eyed fans also spotted a large diamond ring on Gaga's engagement finger in paparazzi photos from her sister's nuptials, leading many to believe she's set to wed to her long-time boyfriend Michael Polansky, who she's been dating for four years.\n\nHowever, the songwriter didn't address speculation she was engaged.\n\nWhile she's kept busy in recent years, Gaga hasn't released an album since 2020's Chromatica, which then saw her embark on a 20-show tour in 2022.\n\nAfter making her feature film debut in 2018's A Star is Born, in which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, Gaga then featured in 2021's House of Gucci.\n\nShe also helped legendary composer Hans Zimmer compose the score for 2022's box office blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick, and loaned her vocals for the film's original song, Hold My Hand.\n\nGaga is finally set to make her return to the big screen in the hugely-anticipated Joker sequel, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, in which she plays the iconic character of Harley Quinn, opposite Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips' follow-up to the Oscar-winning debut film in 2019 will hit cinemas this year.\n\nOriginally published as Lady Gaga expertly addresses 'pregnant' paparazzi

She looked stunning in both.\n\nOf course, the paparazzi couldn't just let Gaga attend her sister's wedding in peace. Nope. They snapped photos of the singer, which eventually made the rounds on TikTok. There were dozens of videos discussing the photos with people speculating and commenting on her body - which, like, haven't people learned by now is not ok?!\n\nSome said \"Congratulations!\" One said, \"Awww a baby bump.\" Another person even wrote, \"Awwww!! A little Monster!! So happy for them!!\"\n\nThe discourse seemingly reached Gaga, who took to TikTok to respond. On Tuesday, She posted this TikTok - now with over 2 million views - and addressed the pregnancy rumors using Taylor Swift lyrics. \"Not pregnant - just down bad cryin at the gym.\"\n\nFor those of you who don't know, this line is from Taylor's song \"Down Bad,\" off her newest album The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nGaga also added, \"Register to vote at www.headcount.org.\" I love an icon who uses her platform to promote voter registration -- especially knowing the news coverage she'll garner from this moment.\n\n\"Can we all agree that it's invasive and irresponsible to comment on a woman's body?\" Taylor said.\n\n\"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation, and neither does any woman \ud83d\udc8b,\" she added.\n\nExactly. People on TikTok praised Taylor for defending Gaga. \"You spilled\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb,\" one person wrote. \"This is why we love you so freaking much THANK YOU.\"\n\nAnother person said, \"Exactly! I'm sorry you even have to say this in the first place.\"\n\nTaylor is no stranger to people body-shaming her. In 2015, comedian Nikki Glaser said, \"She's too skinny; it bothers me. All of her model friends -- and it's just like, c'mon.\" Nikki later apologized and Taylor forgave her. There are other examples, but the comments are gross, sexist, and don't deserve to be highlighted.\n\nThis is also isn't the first time Taylor and Gaga have shown public support for each other.\n\nWhen a clip of Taylor discussing her battle with disordered eating went viral on TikTok, Gaga hopped in the comments and wrote, \"That's really brave everything you said \ud83d\udda4 wow.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Howard Stern, Gaga also praised Taylor for her genuineness:\n\n\"We've met a few times, and I can't say anything bad about her. What she doesn't know [is] I was at the AMAs or something. Her and I were sitting next to each other and she goes, 'Oh my God! I love ARTPOP. I love 'Applause,' and 'Applause' is my favorite song. I was thinking, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. This chick is full of shit. But then my buddy called me, Brandon, who's my stylist, and she was doing a shoot and he was styling her.

\"whole life\" and has spoken out in support of his business ventures, but fans want to learn more about him.\n\nMichael Polansky, 43, is the co-creator and executive director of the Parker Foundation.\n\nThe organization, which launched in 2015, supports philanthropy in life sciences, global public health, civic engagements, and the arts, according to its website.\n\nHe is also on the board of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, which sponsors research for cancer treatment.\n\nPolansky reportedly graduated from Harvard in 2006 with a degree in applied mathematics and computer science.\n\nGaga and Michael were first linked over New Year's Eve in 2020 and then became Instagram official in February after Gaga posted a snap of her cuddling up to her beau.\n\nA month later, she shared a selfie of the pair with the caption: \"I've got a STUPID love\".\n\nShe's also discussed Polansky's work on cancer treatment and technology publicly, giving an interview in which she said she was raising all that she could for his work and describing Polansky as the \"love of my life\".\n\nIn November 2021, Gaga gushed over Michael in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter calling him \"the man I love\" and describing him as \"my whole life.\"\n\nThe two were most recently seen out together on March 13, 2022, when Polansky accompanied the House of Gucci star to two awards shows in one night.\n\nThe couple was seen first in London, for the BAFTAs, before hopping on a plane to LA for the Critics' Choice Awards.\n\nThis is Gaga's third public relationship after being engaged twice before, first to Taylor Kinney in 2015 and then to Christian Carino in 2018.\n\nPolansky's staggering net worth dwarfs even that of his girlfriend.\n\nThe businessman is reportedly worth around $600 million.\n\nThe 43-year-old made his fortune through various business ventures and investments.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"},

Love to all my little monsters and fans, you're the best!\"\n\nFrom then on, she would often share snaps with her new partner, especially once they began quarantining together for the first Covid-19 lockdown.\n\nMORE: Lady Gaga's bombshell revelation about performing sparks major debate: 'I don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable'\n\nShe said during her conversation of her equally philanthropic boyfriend: \"With Born This Way Foundation, my mother, Cynthia Germanotta, and our cofounder Maya, who I love so very much -- they are working with my... the love of my life on something for mental health.\"\n\nHigh-profile appearances -- and more cute moments\n\nOver the next few months, as public events opened up again, so did their relationship.

And last February, they were seen in the bleachers at the Super Bowl, catching the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIs that...a ring?\n\nThe Little Monster ton was abuzz in April when Gaga was seen out on the town sporting a huge diamond sparkler on her ring finger.\n\nThe singer has previously spoken about wanting to settle down and start a family, although that may not happen extremely soon given the recent release of her Chromatica Ball tour film and her upcoming turn in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.

She has previously expressed her support for Joe Biden.\n\nGaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, attended the wedding with her partner of four years, making it clear that the couple is still going strong.\n\nThe hitmaker first sparked engagement rumours in April after she was spotted wearing a diamond ring prompting speculation.\n\nThe pair were first linked just before New Year's Eve 2020 and confirmed their partnership on social media shortly after.\n\nBut since then, the couple has flown under the radar for the most part, though they've been described as 'acting like a married couple' as far back as 2021 and 'completely smitten with one another'.\n\nThe new TikTok is not the first time Lady Gaga has opened up to her fans about her personal life.\n\nLast June, she penned an open letter explaining her decision to become more private, a move she described as necessary for recharging her creative energies.\n\nI can say for the first time in many years that my love of making art, music, fashion, and supporting community has never been more fulfilling,' she shared.\n\nDespite the ongoing rumours and her efforts to maintain privacy, Lady Gaga's professional life continues to thrive.\n\nShe is set to star in the highly anticipated sequel to Joker, titled Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, in which she will portray Harley Quinn opposite Joaquin Phoenix's Joker.\n\nThe movie is scheduled for release later this year, creating plenty of buzz around the iconic singer.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

However, a user noted she had already shut down the rumors about her at one of her Madrid shows, while singing \"But Daddy I Love Him.\"\n\nIn the song, Swift says, \"Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned / Screaming 'But Daddy I love him!' / I'm having his baby / No, I'm not, but you should see your faces.\" According to the TikToker, Swift broke character for a moment while performing, to say, \"No, I'm not,\" seemingly referencing the rumors.\n\nGaga is currently working on her seventh studio album, with her starring role in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux also set to hit the big screen in October, while Swift is currently on the second international leg of her Eras Tour.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christy_pina@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Christy Pi\u00f1a", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Bad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down Bad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Aesthetics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Aesthetics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Taylor-Swift-and-Lady-Gaga-Split-Getty-H-2024.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Couldn't agree more.\n\nRumours about a Gaga pregnancy began circulating after the internet got hold of pictures of the pop star at her sister's wedding. But Gaga brushed it off, posting a TikTok on which she wrote, \"Not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym,\" a reference to Taylor Swift's song \"Down Bad\" from her latest album. Because Lady Gaga is who she is, she also used the attention to tell everyone to make sure they're registered to vote.\n\nTaylor Swift herself commented on the video, urging everyone to quit picking apart everyone's appearance. \"Can we all agree that its invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body. Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\"\n\nTaylor may have also been making a statement to social media users who have recently been speculating that she is pregnant as well, though fans noted she may have already shut down those rumours while performing 'But Daddy I Love Him' at one of her Madrid shows. While singing the lyrics - \"Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned / Screaming 'But Daddy I love him!' / I'm having his baby / No, I'm not, but you should see your faces\" - Taylor apparently broke character during the line, 'No, I'm not,' seemingly in reference to the pregnancy rumours.\n\nSwift has previously revealed how body scrutiny, and in particular pregnancy rumours, have affected her mental health and triggered an eating disorder (something Gaga has dealt with too). In the documentary Miss Americana, Swift explains that she tries not to look at photos of herself every day, because in the past, there were times when she saw \"a picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or...someone said that I looked pregnant...and that'll just trigger me to just starve a little bit -- just stop eating.\n\n\"I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,\" she recalled. \"And the headline was like 'Pregnant at 18?' And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat.\"\n\nSarah Tanno, Gaga's makeup artist and the creative director of her makeup line Haus Labs, also came to the star's defence, calling out the fans who have speculated multiple times that she's pregnant based solely on weight fluctuations (which are normal).\n\n\"Fans have been saying for years that's she was pregnant, just because how she looks in certain outfits. Why spread a rumour about somebody that you care about or love? It does affect people's mental health, people should not be body shaming people or assuming they are pregnant when they aren't!\" wrote Tanno on X.", "source": {"uri": "glamourmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamourmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body shaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-up_artist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make-up artist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6660c0604593541735723a4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gaga%20swift.png?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Gaga not only dropped a link to register through Headcount but referenced Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department track, \"Down Bad,\" in the process. \"Not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym,\" Gaga wrote over the clip (which, honestly, is a legendary way to break her silence).\n\nGaga's clip eventually landed on Taylor's For You Page, and she left a lengthy comment in support of the Haus Labs founder. \"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body,\" Tay wrote. \"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\"\n\nThe pop pioneers have a long history of supporting one another. Taylor's pre-show playlist for the Eras Tour includes Gaga's 2013 hit \"Applause,\" and way back when, Gaga got real about Taylor during an interview with Howard Stern.\n\n\"You know, I've met her a few times and I can't say anything bad about her,\" Gaga explained on his radio show in 2014. \"I think it was at the AMAs or something, her and I were sitting next to each other and she goes, 'I love ARTPOP and I love 'Applause' and 'Applause' is my favorite song!' and I was thinking, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'\"\n\nShe continued, \"But then, my buddy called me and she was doing a shoot and he styled her for a shoot and he goes, 'Taylor Swift is in here and she's blasting ARTPOP so loud, and she's dancing and she's posing.' And I said to myself, 'I like this girl.' You know why? Because she said the same thing to my face that she said behind my back.\"\n\nIn 2015, Gaga sent Taylor and her then-boyfriend, Calvin Harris, well wishes on Twitter, likening her to a Disney princess. A few years later in 2019, the \"Fortnight\" singer presented Gaga with her second Golden Globe for \"Shallow\" back in 2019.\n\nHoping we get to witness more wholesome moments (and potentially a collab) between these two soon! \ud83d\udc95", "source": {"uri": "cosmopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cosmopolitan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_olson@cosmopolitan.com", "name": "Samantha Olson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromatica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applause_(Lady_Gaga_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applause (Lady Gaga song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haus Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Princess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney Princess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Personalities", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Personalities", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Golden_Globe_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Golden Globe Awards", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "wgt": 5}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitled-design-2024-06-05t133304-905-6660a2c9eaa31.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.0160xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The video also came with a caption that delivered two messages. The first somewhat humorously addressed what could be a sensitive and private topic: whether or she's going to have a baby, or she's just put on some weight.\n\nTo that, Gaga said: \"Not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym.\" But with her note, the singer also encouraged people to register to vote at www.headcount.org.\n\nWith Gaga's video, she didn't just knock down fans' hope that she would become a mother for the first time. She also suggested that they probably wouldn't be much more of Polansky, a San Francisco-based tech entrepreneur, anytime soon, TMZ said.\n\nThe singer and her boyfriend have kept a pretty low profile since they began dating more than four years ago. However, they were seen together in February, cheering on the San Francisco 49ers as they played the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII. The singer held Polansky's hand as they occupied seats in front of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel.\n\nGaga and Polansky first went public with their relationship during another Super Bowl weekend -- Super Bowl LIV in Miami in 2020. That's when the 49ers also lost to the Chiefs. Gaga made the relationship Instagram official by posting a photo of the two of them, cuddling. Her caption read, \"We had so much fun in Miami. Love to all my little monsters and fans, you're the best!\"\n\nThe following year, Polansky was Gaga's plus-one at the inauguration of President Joe Biden, where she sang the national anthem.\n\nBut if they've kept a low profile, that could be because Polansky isn't part of Gaga's show business world. He's a 2006 Harvard grad in applied mathematics and computer science, who works with Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster and Facebook, on various ventures, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nThese include the Parker Foundation, which was launched in 2015 and supports philanthropic efforts in life sciences, global public health, civic engagement and the arts, according to the foundation's website. Polansky also is co-founder and board member of the San Francisco-based Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, which sponsors research for cancer treatment.\n\nWhen Gaga began dating Polansky, she was following a certain trend that was pretty popular for a while, involving well-known female celebrities looking to the tech world for dating and marriage opportunities.\n\nThe women at the forefront of this trend were tennis champion Serena Williams, who married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in 2017, and former Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr, who also married Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel in 2017.\n\nNews of Gaga and Polansky's romance sparked a very unusual reaction from his ex-girlfriend, journalist Lindsay Crouse. The New York Times staff member penned a cheeky op-ed, describing what it was like to find out that her ex-boyfriend was dating one of the most famous women on the planet.\n\n\"If you've ever googled an ex's new partner (be honest) you've probably played a certain game with yourself,\" Crouse wrote. \"You're either just curious -- which is healthy of you -- or you want to know how you compare. Ideally the ex's life didn't improve too much without you? In this case, though, that's all upended. How do you compare yourself with Lady Gaga?\"\n\nCrouse said they began dating in college and the relationship lasted several years after that. But rather than feel intimidated by Gaga, Crouse wrote that she instead decided to be inspired by her. She wrote that she had decided to live more fearlessly.\n\n\"Lady Gaga is amazing,\" Crouse wrote. \"Comparing yourself with her is incredibly motivational, and I recommend you try it, regardless of how you relate to who's dating her.\"\n\nSeveral months later, Gaga described Polansky as \"the love of my life\" in an interview, according to Today. During an April 2020 appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" she referred to Polansky when talking about the importance of mental health and how it relates to her Born This Way Foundation.\n\n\"With Born This Way Foundation, my mother, Cynthia Germanotta, and our co-founder Maya, who I love so very much, they are working with the love of my life on something for mental health,\" she said with a smile during the interview, Today reported.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@mercurynews.com", "name":

Earlier this month, a TikTok clip creepily scrutinizing Taylor Swift's body while performing on her record-breaking Eras Tour went viral, sparking rumors that the musician could be pregnant. Then on Monday, Jun. 3, a similar rumor about Lady Gaga made headlines when she was seen simply existing at her sister's wedding.\n\nIt might not seem like it, but celebrities have internet access too, and Swift and Gaga's prompt responses to the chatter proved it. In less than 24 hours, the latter shared a TikTok video telling her followers she was \"not pregnant,\" while also using the opportunity to urge them to register to vote and quote the chorus of Swift's \"Down Bad\" in the same breath.\n\nOn Wednesday, Swift acknowledged the video commenting, \"Can we all agree that its [sic] invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body. Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman\" -- which she concluded with a sassy kiss emoji. To Swift's fans and anyone keeping up with celebrity gossip, it was clear that the message wasn't just about her colleague. It also served as a dig at those who had been directing the same kind of \"invasive and irresponsible\" gaze at her.\n\nEven before Swift commented on Gaga's TikTok page, she already seemingly denied being pregnant while performing \"But Daddy I Love Him\" at her first concert in Lyon, France, by placing more emphasis than usual on the \"No, I'm not\" half of the song's \"I'm having his baby\" verse. The entire song is a cautionary tale about \"judgemental creeps\" and \"vipers dressed in empaths' clothing,\" so it fit the occasion perfectly.\n\nThe aggressive probing takes on especially disturbing contours when reminded that both Gaga and Swift have admitted to struggling with eating disorders in the past. The former confessed to suffering from bulimia and anorexia since she was 15 back in 2012, while a significant portion of Swift's 2020 Miss Americana documentary focuses exactly on the effect media attention had on her relationship with her body.\n\nIt's not good for me to see pictures of myself every day. (...) A picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or... someone said that I looked pregnant ... and that'll just trigger me to just starve a little bit -- just stop eating.\"\n\nSpeaking toVariety, the 34-year-old \"Cruel Summer\" singer revealed that she was 18 years old when she appeared on the cover of a magazine for the first time, and the headline said something along the lines of \"Pregnant at 18?\" all because, in her words, she \"had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat.\"\n\nWhen Gaga first spoke about her eating disorders, it was also in response to pregnancy speculation. A few months prior, she was asked by a younger fan at a conference in a Los Angeles school about body image. Her response is depressingly suitable for the events of the last few days.\n\nWeight is still a struggle. Every video I'm in, every magazine cover, they stretch you -- they make you perfect. It's not real life ... I'm gonna say this about girls: The dieting wars have got to stop. Everyone, just knock it off. Because at the end of the day, it's affecting kids your age. And it's making girls sick.\"\n\nNot only were Gaga and Swift's words almost identical, but they were also expressed 12 and 4 years ago, respectively. And yet, nothing much has changed. Pregnancy rumors still circulate when, in truth, they are just a fa\u00e7ade for pointing the finger at the bodies of celebrities who dare not be a size 0.\n\nPutting others down has long been a way to make certain people feel better about themselves, but we promise, even if they are sick and tired of dealing with the same ridiculous comments for decades now, Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga are still going to sell out stadiums and break records while their detractors spend their time on social media recycling the same old juiceless gossip.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "francisca_tinoco@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Francisca Tinoco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anorexia nervosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bulimia nervosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_Summer_(Bananarama_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dieting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body image"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lady-Gaga-Taylor-Swift.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 524, "textEnd": 530}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I am the aesthetic. I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out here right now going to Pinterest just typing in all these adjectives to describe me.\"\n\nGaga attended her sister's wedding in Maine with boyfriend Michael Polansky. The two were first linked at the end of 2019 and their relationship became serious when they quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the couple sparked engagement rumors when the \"Just Dance\" singer was photographed wearing a massive diamond ring on her left hand. However, they have not confirmed if they took that next step in their relationship.\n\nThe New York native was previously engaged to Taylor Kinney. He popped the question on Valentine's Day 2015, but the two split by July 2016. She then started dating Christian Carino at the beginning of 2017. Engagement rumors first surfaced that fall, which Gaga confirmed nearly a year later in October 2018. However, the relationship ended in February 2019.\n\nOver the years, Gaga has been open about wanting to start a family one day. \"I am very excited to have kids,\" she said in a 2020 interview with InStyle. \"I look forward to being a mom. Isn't it incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it. Then it comes out and it's our job to keep it alive. It's so funny - everyone works out of my house every day. When they come in, I always say, 'Welcome to the Womb!'\"\n\nShe also included children as part of her 10-year plan in a 2019 YouTube video. \"I want to do more movies, I want to have babies and I want to continue to build the behemoth that is Haus Laboratories into the makeup company of my dreams,\" the musician confirmed.", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Bad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Down Bad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Kinney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Kinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Dance_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Just Dance (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haus Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InStyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "InStyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lady-Gaga-Denies-Pregnancy-Rumors-Amid-Fan-Speculation.jpg?crop=0px%2C312px%2C3461px%2C1816px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1162}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 1319, "textEnd": 1331}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 1368, "textEnd": 1381}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman. \ud83d\udc8b\"\n\nIf you don't know, Taylor has been open in the past about struggling with body image and disordered eating.\n\nYou can see a screen grab of the comment in the gallery of this post...", "source": {"uri": "justjared.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Just Jared"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Bad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down Bad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body image"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Quotations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Closed_Captioning", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Closed Captioning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Urban_Primitive", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Urban Primitive", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 6}], "image": "https://cdn01.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2024/06/taylor-swift-lady-gaga-comment1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The \"Born This Way\" songstress stood by Natali's side during her wedding in a small seaside town in Maine on Saturday, June 1.\n\nLady Gaga, 38, wore a flowing peach-colored dress and held a bouquet of white flowers as she linked arms with one of the groomsmen on her way down the aisle. The \"Poker Face\" singer had her blonde hair pinned up in an elegant bun with pink flowers tucked into her tresses. Once she got to the front, she was happy to perform big sister duties as she sweetly helped adjust Natali's veil and straighten her train.\n\nThe \"Bad Romance\" artist was joined by her longtime partner Michael Polansky, along with several other members of her and Natali's family. The Sun reported that Natali and Gaga's family rented out the entire Viewpoint Hotel in York, Maine, for the weekend, which included eight suites in the main building with seven seaside rooms. Before the wedding, Gaga attended Natali's rehearsal dinner where she wore an all-black dress and accessorized with a large diamond ring and matching diamond earrings.\n\nGaga and Natali, 32, have always been close and the Grammy winner even brought her younger sis along with her to the 2019 Academy Awards. She sat front row and watched Gaga win an Oscar for her work on the song \"Shallow\" that was featured in the film A Star Is Born. However, Natali wasn't a stranger to the movie and she was credited as being Gaga's fashion stylist for the film.\n\nNatali works as a fashion designer and has created several looks for the \"Telephone\" singer, including her look at the 2022 Chromatica Ball and one of her dresses from the 2022 Grammy Awards. The younger Germanotta sister hasn't always been on board with some of Gaga's more outlandish styles, though.\n\n\"Some of the stuff she wears I'd be like, 'No, never,'\" Natali said during an interview with Teen Vogue published on September 8, 2011.\n\nShe continued, \"Whenever I wear something crazy and my dad gives me a hard time, I say, 'Well, at least I'm not walking out on the street with red pasties.' And he'll be like, 'Good point.'\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "whitney_danhauer@yahoo.com", "name": "Whitney Danhauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridesmaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Face_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poker Face (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_This_Way_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Born This Way (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wedding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(jewellery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ring (jewellery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chromatica_Ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Chromatica Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "64th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/91st_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "91st Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_stylist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wardrobe stylist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teen Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Formal_Wear", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Formal Wear", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5CxUBBP8DX5rRiWm2nizSw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xMTQ0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/in_touch_weekly_336/c09110e71d43286cf90577f651c7a6e9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 296}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-09-08", "textStart": 2015, "textEnd": 2032}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The speculation began after photos surfaced of her at her sister Natali Germanotta's rehearsal dinner and wedding over the weekend.\n\nIn a world where women's bodies are analyzed under a miscroscope, part of the internet quickly decided that she was pregnant. The Oscar award winning actress took to TikTok on Tuesday, June 4, to share a selfie-style video with her signature black eyeliner wing with the words \"not pregnant- just down bad cryin' at the gym.\"\n\nThe \"Poker Face\" singer used a viral voiceover about aesthetics for the video. \"I don't have to find an aesthetic, I am the aesthetic,\" the audio says. She also used the opportunity to encourage her 9.3 million to register to vote. \"Register to vote at www.headcount.org\" she wrote.\n\nWhile Gaga may not be pregnant now, we may see her little monsters in the future. The 38-year-old singer told Sirius XM radio in 2013 that she wants at least three kids. \"I really want to have a family. I really want to have a family, I really want to nurture my children,\" she said.\n\nThe singer and her partner have been linked since December 2019, but his identity wasn't made public until February 2020. By April, she was calling the Harvard University graduate and CEO of the Parker Group the love of her life, per Cosmopolitan.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gaga has sparked rumors this year.

I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out here right now who is going into Pinterest trying to type up all these adjectives to describe me.\"\n\nThe Love For Sale singer then took the opportunity to remind her followers to focus on more important matters, instructing them to \"register to vote at www.headcount.org.\" She doubled down on the request in her caption, too, writing to fans, \"Register to vote or check if you're registered EASILY at www.headcount.org.\"\n\nGaga's TikTok video follows rampant pregnancy rumors that began after photos of the singer celebrating her sister Natali Germanotta's wedding in Maine surfaced on June 3.\n\nAfterward, her makeup artist, Sarah Tanno, came to her defense in a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), where she wrote, \"Honestly, it's really sad that she had to address this because people were commenting about her body.\"\n\nShe continued, \"People should not be allowed to comment on other people's body, fans have been saying for years that's she was pregnant, just because how she looks in certain outfits. Why spread a rumor about somebody that you care about or love? It does affect people's mental health, people should not be body shaming people or assuming they are pregnant when they aren't!\"\n\nTanno, 43, concluded her message by writing, \"Even if she was pregnant, it's none of your business to know at all. Why are people obsessed with her being pregnant or not?? I don't get it.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Gaga has had to address speculation surrounding her body. In 2017, she wrote a brief message to fans in an Instagram post that read, \"I heard my body is a topic of conversation so I wanted to say, I'm proud of my body and you should be proud of yours too. No matter who you are or what you do.\"\n\n\"I could give you a million reasons why you don't need to cater to anyone or anything to succeed,\" the \"Born This Way\" performer continued. \"Be you, and be relentlessly you.

For the special occasion, Gaga looked elegant in a romantic champagne gown designed by Germanotta under her very own label, Topo Studio.\n\nThe piece featured a draped Bardot neckline with buttons descending down the center to a shirred bodice. The sweeping asymmetrical skirt added even more dimension with its tiers of delicate pleats. Gaga styled the bridesmaid look with matching sheer opera-length gloves and topped it off with a mini bouquet made of white, yellow, and green flowers. Beauty-wise, she swept her signature platinum blonde hair into a sophisticated updo, with a few face-framing strands left hanging down on the sides.\n\nHer sister's wedding continues Gaga's recent fashion marathon, which also includes a red-carpet appearance in May for the world premiere of her HBO concert film Gaga Chromatica Ball. At the event, the superstar went back to her roots in an experimental, avant-garde ensemble composed of a white one-shoulder gown embellished with zippers and grommets and a structural \"car part\" piece layered atop -- a unique Selva design.

Have you ever just been out in the world, minding your own business, only to have a total stranger ask you when your baby is due? And you're not actually pregnant? It's happened to me, and let me tell you, it sucks! It's a very special kind of public humiliation to have some random point out your stomach and wonder aloud what trimester you're in.\n\nNow being pushed into the discourse is Lady Gaga, who was photographed with a telescopic lens while she attended her sister Natali's wedding. Gaga was on bridesmaid duties, and the attention was not meant to be on her. But being a major star means having to worry about helicopters and snoopers following you around while your sister gets married. In a few images of the after-party, Gaga wore a cute short black dress and oh no, she had a visible belly. Scandal! She must be pregnant, right?! How dare a woman not have a convex gut while we're spying on her.\n\nGaga had no time for this nonsense and took to Instagram Stories to quash the rumours as quickly as possible. She shared a video on Twitter too, telling people she wasn't up the duff but that you should totally register to vote while you're there.\n\nThis is maybe the only time in my life I've ever had something in common with Lady Gaga. I think a lot of women will relate to having total strangers gawk at their stomachs and ask intrusive questions about pregnancies. The misogyny of it is evident, as is the fatphobia. One wonders if humanity is truly this clueless about how bodies work or if they're so allergic to the idea of body fat percentages higher than skimmed milk that they lose their minds once someone has a big lunch.\n\nIt's especially tough for women dealing with chronic health issues, as Gaga does. She's been candid about her experiences with fibromyalgia, a condition that has caused her intense pain for several years, and issues brought on by a hip injury she incurred in the early 2010s. Maybe she's on some medication that causes bloating, or maybe she's dealing with side effects from her injuries, or maybe she's just eating well, and it's none of your damn business.\n\nAt the heart of this, aside from the endless policing of women's bodies in a post-Roe American society, is the sheer hatred of fatness. Gaga is by no stretch of the imagination plus-sized, but in a few images taken without her consent, she had a slight stomach bulge and rounder face, and that was enough for the press and public to declare open season on her body. It's gross and unfair and, again, nobody else's business.\n\nSo, a word of advice to you all: unless you see a literal infant exiting someone's body, don't ask them how far along they are.

Show off Their Karate Skills in the Cutest New Video\n\nTaylor Swift would like to remind everybody that women's bodies (or anyone else's) are not up for discussion, thank you very much. The \"Karma\" singer made a rare TikTok comment to defend her friend and fellow pop singer Lady Gaga against Internet trolls claiming she was pregnant, and we are praising her powerful statement!\n\nIt started when pictures of the \"Bad Romance\" singer at her sister's wedding went viral, when people speculated that she was pregnant. (Ugh, can we just not?) She addressed the rumors in a TikTok on Tuesday, writing, \"Not pregnant -- just down bad cryin at the gym\" in references to one of Swift's new songs on The Tortured Poets Department album. She also encouraged people to \"register to vote at www.headcount.org.\" (Using a horrible moment to spread the word about voting? Queen move!)\n\nAnd because Swift is all about uplifting other women, she commented on Gaga's video to slam the haters. \"Can we all agree that its invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body,\" the Grammy winner wrote, per Instagram account @commentsbycelebs. \"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\" Period! There is no reason to ever speculate about someone's fertility. You never know what someone else is going through, and even wondering if they are pregnant is crossing a line.\n\nThe \"Fortnight\" singer has also been the target of pregnancy rumors lately. People were sharing photos of Swift on Twitter from an Eras Tour performance, where she was wearing a bright orange bodysuit. \"People are saying Taylor Swift is pregnant because of this photo like bitch she is B R E A T H I N G,\" one person wrote, defending the star. Because god forbid a woman take a deep breath without getting accused of carrying a baby. (Incidentally, she hasn't shared her Instagram posts on Twitter lately, which some fans think is a sign she is annoyed with the discourse around her body.)\n\nSwift has been the subject of pregnancy speculation several times throughout her life. Like when she released \"Bigger Than the Whole Sky\" on Midnights, and people thought it meant she had a miscarriage. In her 2020 Miss Americana documentary, Swift said in the past she's seen \"a picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or... someone said that I looked pregnant ... and that'll just trigger me to just starve a little bit -- just stop eating.\"\n\nShe elaborated more about her struggles with an eating disorder in a candid interview with Variety. \"I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,\" she said. \"And the headline was like 'Pregnant at 18?' And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat. So I just registered that as a punishment. And then I'd walk into a photo shoot and be in the dressing room and somebody who worked at a magazine would say, 'Oh, wow, this is so amazing that you can fit into the sample sizes. Usually we have to make alterations to the dresses, but we can take them right off the runway and put them on you!' And I looked at that as a pat on the head. You register that enough times, and you just start to accommodate everything towards praise and punishment, including your own body.\"\n\nHer comments from Miss Americana made it to TikTok, where it was noticed by Lady Gaga. \"That's really brave everything you said \ud83d\udda4 wow,\" the \"Applause\" singer commented, per Page Six.\n\nThese two iconic women are the perfect example of grace and power, and we love them for speaking up for themselves and each other. Maybe eventually the message will make its way into the haters' heads. In the meantime, we are going to act like Swift and Gaga and just \"Shake It Off.\"", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydni_ellis@sheknows.com", "name": "Sydni Ellis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troll (slang)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Than_the_Whole_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bigger Than the Whole Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applause_(Lady_Gaga_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applause (Lady Gaga song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_It_Off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shake It Off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Women", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Women", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Taylor-Swift-Lady-Gaga.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation and neither does any woman,\" Swift wrote in the comments, sealing it with a kiss emoji.\n\nIn fact, Swift has also been subject to people alleging she's pregnant, with people dissecting her body at every angle in still photos captured while she's performing her three-and-a-half hour long The Eras Tour concert.\n\nFans praised both singers shutting the rumors down.\n\n\"You are right,\" one commenter wrote. \"People (especially the media) should learn that a woman's body is not something they can comment on.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" another added. \"I'm sorry you have to even have to say this in the first place.\"", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_vallone@islandpacket.com", "name": "Sara Vallone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swift (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/er13kn/picture289036019/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/gaga%20swift_fitted.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621863", "eventUri": "eng-9621863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

And I looked at that as a pat on the head.\"\n\nSwift then admitted that the preoccupation the world had with her body left her with unhealthy eating patterns, and even resulted in her \"starving\" herself.\n\nZoe Papadakis \u2709\n\nZoe Papadakis is a Newsmax writer based in South Africa with two decades of experience specializing in media and entertainment.

The company aims to help 'improve human skin health'.\n\nHis net worth has been estimated to be up to $600million.\n\nAfter his relationship was confirmed with Gaga in February 2020, Michael's ex-girlfriend and senior New York Times Opinion editor - who he reportedly dated for seven years - wrote an op-ed reflecting on the news he had moved on with a Grammy-winning superstar.\n\nIn December 2019, various outlets reported that the pair had met at mutual friend Sean's birthday party in Los Angeles and hit it off.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, in February 2020 the House of Gucci star posted an Instagram of her cuddling up with Michael in Miami, with the caption: 'We had so much fun in Miami. Love to all my little monsters and fans, you're the best!'.\n\nThe post gained almost three million likes as fans flocked to the comments to congratulate the happy couple.\n\nAfter going Instagram official, a source told Entertainment Tonight: 'She wasn't expecting to get so involved so quickly after her last relationship, but she started telling her friends she was completely in love with him.\n\n'Anyone that has spent any time with them can see the connection. They are completely smitten. Her friends haven't seen her this happy in years. It didn't take long for her friends to adore him too.'\n\nThe same year she said in an interview she was looking forward to 'marriage' and kids.\n\n'I will say I am very excited to have kids,' she told InStyle. 'I look forward to being a mum. Isn't it incredible what we can do? We can hold a human inside and grow it.'\n\nAs their relationship grew stronger, in March 2021 the musician posted herself with a huge bouquet of flowers from her boyfriend, writing 'I love you honey' and implied that the pair lived together with their dogs.\n\nThe Applause singer mentioned him to the press for the first time in 2021, telling The Hollywood Reporter that her dogs and 'man that I love' were her 'whole life'.\n\nAnd in 2022, they made a seldom-seen appearance together at the Bafta awards ceremony in London.\n\nIn October 2023, the couple were spotted on several date nights in Las Vegas while in February 2024, they attended the Super Bowl together.\n\nAfter laying low for a few months, a source told ET in February 2024 that the couple were 'together and going strong' and added that they were in no rush to mark any milestones as they are 'content with where things are at'.\n\nMuch like Michael's support for Gaga during her awards run for House of Gucci, we have no doubt he will be behind her as she debuts her role as Harley Quinn opposite Joaquin Phoenix in the highly anticipated blockbuster Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or

The singer was spotted at the wedding of her sister Natalie Germanotta with a small belly - fans speculated that the artist might be expecting her first child.\n\nThe 38-year-old singer arrived at the event with her partner, 46-year-old businessman Michael Polanski. It was reported by The Sun.\n\nAlthough the singer has not yet commented on the rumors, in interviews in the past she has repeatedly emphasized her desire to become a mother. \"I am looking forward to becoming a mom. Isn't it incredible that we are capable of this? We are able to give life to a person and raise them,\" she said in a conversation with InStyle magazine.\n\nWhat is known about the celebrity's chosen one\n\nAs you know, Gaga and Polanski have been together for over four years. Michael is the executive director of the Parker Foundation. He created the foundation in 2015 with Sean Parker, co-founder of major technology companies such as Napster and Facebook. The charitable organization supports global health initiatives, civic engagement, and the arts. Polanski studied applied mathematics and computer science at Harvard University.\n\nPolanski and Gaga's relationship\n\nFor the first time, the star was seen with her beau on the eve of the New Year's Eve in the winter of 2019. At the time, insiders reported that \"she was madly in love with him.\"\n\nAlthough Gaga and Polanski don't seem to be in a hurry to get engaged, a source told People in November 2021: \"They're already acting like a married couple.\" The insider said they were brought together by their mutual \"focus\" on charity. \"Michael is very sweet and supportive,\" the source said. \"He's also a hard worker, so he appreciates focus.

I'm so excited,\" Gaga told the crowd, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe star then revealed that she \"did five shows with Covid\" as she didn't want to cancel and disappoint the tens of thousands of supporters who planned to attend.\n\nShe reiterated that she took extra precautions to inform her team and give them the option not to perform on the dates she was testing positive.\n\nShe explained: \"I shared [the news] with everyone on my team. I said, 'I don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable at work and you don't have to perform and you don't have to work that day, but I'm going to do the show' because I just didn't want to let all the fans down.\n\n\"And the way that I saw it also is like the fans were all putting themselves in harm's way every day coming to the show.\"\n\nIn response to the singer's admission, fans shared a range of views on social media, with some shocked at her actions.\n\n\"She performed with WHAT and WHERE during WHEN???\" an aghast X user wrote.\n\nA different user said: \"Ummm why on earth would you reveal that? You're just giving yourself backlash because you're putting the health and safety of not only yourself, but THOUSANDS of people at risk...,\" while another claimed: \"That's just irresponsible.\"\n\nHowever, others were more understanding of the singer's decision to perform.\n\n\"She was vaccinated around a group of the same 30 people for four months and they all knew when she was sick & consented to performing...

As she navigates the complexities of fame, her actions remind us that celebrities are more than the sum of the rumors that surround them. They are individuals with their own stories, challenges, and aspirations. And in Lady Gaga's case, she's not just a star; she's a force of nature who knows how to turn the spotlight into a beacon for change.\n\nIn the whirlwind world of celebrity news, rumors can ignite like wildfire, spreading with speed and sparking a spectrum of reactions. Recently, the spotlight turned to Lady Gaga, an icon known for her musical prowess and her ability to captivate audiences with her performances and personal style. The rumor mill churned with speculation that Lady Gaga was expecting her first child with her partner, Michael Polansky. However, in true Lady Gaga fashion, she addressed the rumors head-on with a dash of her signature flair.\n\nLady Gaga, a multi-faceted artist whose career spans music, acting, and activism, has always had a unique way of communicating with her fans and the public. When the pregnancy rumors reached a fever pitch in June, she took to social media to set the record straight. With a TikTok video that was both straightforward and tinged with humor, she declared, \"Not pregnant,\" quashing the rumors unequivocally. This move is reflective of her approach to her public persona -- direct, unapologetic, and often with a twist that keeps people talking.\n\nThe incident also highlights the intense scrutiny that celebrities face regarding their personal lives. Every public appearance, every social media post, and every interaction can be dissected for hidden meanings or signs of change. For female artists, in particular, this scrutiny often extends to their bodies, with any perceived change sparking speculation about pregnancy. It's a pressure that is uniquely magnified in the glare of the public eye, and Lady Gaga's response is a reminder of the need for boundaries and respect for personal privacy.\n\nMoreover, Lady Gaga's response wasn't just about denying the rumors. She used the moment to encourage her followers to focus on more pressing matters, sharing a link to register to vote. This pivot from personal rumor to civic action is emblematic of her broader efforts to use her platform for advocacy. Whether it's promoting mental health awareness, supporting the LGBTQ+ community, or encouraging political engagement, Lady Gaga has consistently leveraged her influence on champion causes close to her heart.\n\nThe relationship between celebrities and the public is a complex dance of curiosity, admiration, and sometimes, overstepping. Lady Gaga's handling of the pregnancy rumors is a testament to her ability to navigate this landscape with grace and purpose. It's a reminder that behind the larger-than-life persona, there's a person who values her privacy and agency, and who won't shy away from speaking her truth.\n\nAs fans and observers, we can take a cue from Lady Gaga's playbook. We can admire and celebrate our favorite artists for their work and the joy they bring into our lives. At the same time, we can respect their humanity and the fact that some aspects of their lives are not ours to speculate on or claim. In doing so, we foster a culture of respect that allows artists to thrive and share their gifts without the weight of unfounded rumors.\n\nLady Gaga's journey continues to be one of bold expression and boundary-pushing artistry.

In the clip, the \"Applause\" singer denied speculation that she was pregnant, while referring to a lyric from Swift's song \"Down Bad\", as text over the video reads: \"Just down bad cryin' at the gym.\"\n\nIn the comment of the video, where Gaga also encouraged people to register to vote, Swift hit back at the public's obsession with women's appearances while defending her friend.\n\n\"Can we all agree that it's invasive & irresponsible to comment on a woman's body,\" the \"Cruel Summer\" singer wrote. \"Gaga doesn't owe anyone an explanation & neither does any woman.\"\n\nSwift's comments also come days after speculation that she and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, were expecting, with Spanish publication Marca claiming that she appeared to be pregnant in footage from her recent Eras Tour.\n\nThe singer's devoted fans have been quick to defend her on social media, with many pointing out that we shouldn't be making assumptions about a woman's body in the first place.\n\n\"I don't understand why people honestly believe Taylor Swift is pregnant. Are you all living under a rock?\" one wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"I drink half a glass of water and I look even more bloated than that. Stop assuming women are always pregnant and let us be happy and healthy without the constant judgment.\"\n\n\"Please don't do this, peeps,\" another wrote. \"I absolutely can't wait for Taylor Swift to become a mama. I assume that the topic has come up between her and Travis, even. However, please, please, please don't ever post pictures of a woman's body and make guesses that she is pregnant. This is never, ever okay for several reasons.\"\n\n\"2024 and still assuming a woman is pregnant because she has a 'belly,' yeah let's forget that we have a uterus and bloating is possible let's forget science! Pathetic!\" a third wrote.\n\nThe \"Fortnight\" singer has previously hit back at rumors made about her appearance. During an interview with Variety in 2020, following the release of her Miss Americana documentary, she addressed how a tabloid once claimed that she was pregnant, and how that headline affected her.\n\n\"I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine,\" she said. \"And the headline was like 'Pregnant at 18?'

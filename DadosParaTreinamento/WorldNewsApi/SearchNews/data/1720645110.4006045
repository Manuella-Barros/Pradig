That\u2019s because the games at London Stadium have been so high-scoring. Good game plan, but here\u2019s another twist: The artificial turf here is pretty bouncy. \u201cIt\u2019s the bounciest turf I\u2019ve ever been on, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos said Saturday before the opener of a two-game set. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to have to respect it a little bit, attack ground balls differently once it\u2019s in the outfield.\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson described the field surface as \u201ca little bit spongier than the turf that we see in the U.S.\u201d In 2019, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox combined for 10 homers over two games at the home of Premier League club West Ham. New York won 17-13 and 12-8. The fences were pushed back for last year\u2019s series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. The 16-foot-high center field wall is 392 feet from home plate \u2014 7 feet deeper than in 2019. The power alleys are 387 feet \u2014 an increase of 5 feet. Those dimensions are the same this time. Down each line is 330 feet. The Cubs beat the Cardinals 9-1 in the first game last year in London, and the Cards earned the split with a 7-5 victory in the second one. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw a lot of splitters, try to get a lot of ground balls tomorrow,\u201d Walker said Saturday. \u201cThe ball does fly here. Try to keep the ball on the ground as much as possible, it should be fine.\u201d The Yankees-Red Sox series was the first time in their storied rivalry that they played on artificial turf. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3BoaWxsaWVzLW1ldHMtdHVyZi1sb25kb24tc3RhZGl1bS1lYTBmYmFiMjU2ZjhjMmFmY2Y2NzY1OWFkYjFlNjg5NtIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Phillies wary of 'bounciest turf' in London for Mets series</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/phillies-mets-turf-london-stadium-ea0fbab256f8c2afcf67659adb1e6896", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/820d97b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5237x2946+0+273/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F2b%2F67%2F88f7907d3b7be89ecfcbbdff7e76%2F749a6af4523f475f8b2b8e40603ceccc", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:37:00", "author": "Ken Maguire", "authors": ["Ken Maguire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.02}

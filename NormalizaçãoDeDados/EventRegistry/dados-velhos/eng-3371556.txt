Three Italians were among the 100 injured, the ministry said. The first victim, Bruno Gulotta, 35, a hardware company marketing chief from Legnano north of Milan, was on holiday in Barcelona with his wife and kids. The second victim was named as Luca Russo, on holiday with his girlfriend who was injured but is said not to be in serious condition. There is not yet official confirmation from Spanish authorities of his death. Gulotta's wife reported that he had been among the 13 killed on Las Ramblas by a van that ploughed into the tourist crowds. Gulotta made sure his kids were safe before being killed, the head of the Legnano hardware company he worked for, Pino Bruno, said. \"They were walking along Las Ramblas with their two children, Aria, seven months old, and Alessandro, six, who his father was holding by the hand. \"The van suddenly arrived. \"They all instinctively crouched, to protect themselves,\" said Bruno. Gulotta shielded his kids and was killed. The mayor of Legnano, Giambattista Fratus, told a press conference that Gulotta had been killed while protecting his children. Police are seeking the van driver, an 18-year-old from North Africa named Moussa Oukabir. In a social-media post two years ago, Oukabir said \"kill the infidels, and leave only Muslims who follow their religion\". After the van attack that left 100 injured including three Italians, there was another van attack at Cambrils, a resort 70 km from Barcelona, where police killed five terrorists after seven people including a policeman were hurt. A woman died overnight in Cambrils, bringing the toll in the two attacks to 14. The Cambrils terrorists were said to be preparing another attack on Barcelona. Premier Paolo Gentiloni telephoned Spanish Premier Mariano Rajoy to voice Italy's condolences, friendship and solidarity over the attack, government sources said. Gentiloni stressed unity and firmness towards terror, which will never beat freedom and democracy. Rajoy assured the utmost collaboration with Italy and the other countries hit by the attack. Italian President Sergio Mattarella wrote to Spanish King Felipe VI, voicing \"horror and repulsion\". Spain and Italy were united in a \"common pain\" over the attack, Mattarella said. He voiced \"great concern\" over the \"dramatic\" attack, which was \"further, execrable proof of the cowardice of the terrorists\". Mattarella said Italy was determined to work with Spain, its EU partners and the whole international community, in a \"fight, without quarter being given, against terrorism and all forms of violent extremism, in defence of the common values and democratic freedoms, as well as the security of cour countries\". Pope Francis condemned the attack as an \"inhuman act\" and \"blind violence, a grave offence to the Creator\", in a telegramme of condolences sent to Barcelona Archbishop Juan Jos\u00e9 Omella y Omella. Francis said he was praying that the international community would work \"with determination for peace and harmony in the world\".", "id": "9886430", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "2

pedestrians in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils, killing 14 and injuring over 100, police said.\n\n\"A fourth person has been detained in relation with the events that have taken place in the last few hours in Cambrils and Barcelona,\" police in the Catalonia region tweeted.\n\nThey said the arrest was made in Ripoll -- the same city in northern Catalonia where another suspect and Driss Oukabir, a Moroccan, have already been detained on suspicion of as-yet unspecified involvement in the attacks.\n\nPolice are searching for Driss Oukabir's brother Moussa, but it was not known whether he was the latest person arrested.\n\nSpain is reeling from the double attack on Thursday and Friday that saw drivers in Barcelona and Cambrils plough into pedestrians, following similar attacks in other European countries including France, Britain and Germany over the last year or so.\n\nPolice said they killed five \"suspected terrorists\" during the night and four suspects have now been arrested, although authorities had said the driver of the van in Barcelona remained at large.", "id": "9899530", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "34 nationalities among Spain attack

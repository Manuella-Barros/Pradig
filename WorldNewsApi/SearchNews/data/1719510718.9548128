The high-pressure water jets can wreak havoc on certain materials and surfaces, so it's crucial to know when to avoid using them. Delicate areas such as woodwork, painted items, and older brick constructions are particularly at risk. The intense spray can easily strip paint, splinter wood, and wear down the mortar in brickwork. Windows too can suffer; they're no match for the force of a pressure washer and could end up cracked or shattered. Claire Baglin, Toolstation's landscaping category manager, warns against misuse: \"Incorrect use can lead to damaged surfaces and items which can be very costly to fix or replace. In a worst-case scenario, you could even cause serious injury.\" Baglin offers her expertise on the dos and don'ts of pressure washing, reports the Mirror. Five things you should never attempt to clean with a pressure washer Painted surfaces The forceful spray is likely to chip or peel the paint, and it might even remove it entirely. If you need to get rid of paint, stick to sanding and scraping instead. Brick and mortar Brick is a porous material and soaks up a certain amount of water. Too much of this water will cause the brick to crack as it dries out, weakening the structure. The mortar between bricks can also be forcibly detached from the high water pressure. Windows The high-pressure water can penetrate to the window seals which can cause lasting damage including dampness and condensation. The force of the water may also potentially shatter the window leading to a costly replacement. Solar panels and lighting Pressure washing can scratch the surface of solar panels thereby reducing their effectiveness. The high-pressure water can also penetrate the frame causing long-term damage. Roof tiles Not only is working at height dangerous, but the intense water pressure can loosen roof tiles causing them to detach and break away either instantly or worse, at a later date. This will leave the roof susceptible to leaks and damage. Five things that are suitable to clean with a pressure washer Pressure washers are measured in PSI (pounds per square inch) and most can be adjusted depending on the job. If you're a DIY'er, a pressure washer with at least 3,000 PSI should cover most jobs around the home. Vehicles For vehicles, a pressure of no more than 1,500 PSI should be used with a nozzle that is 40 degrees. The higher the nozzle degrees, the gentler the spray pattern will be, and so the vehicle's paintwork or glass windows will not be damaged. Paving/Patios For patios and paving slabs, a high-pressure setting of around 3,000 PSI should be utilised. A 10-15 degree nozzle is also recommended to effectively blast away accumulated dirt and grime. Extra care should be taken with the grout between paving slabs as the high pressure can cause it to dislodge. Wooden decking Decking requires a low pressure of no more than 1,200 PSI with a 60-degree nozzle. This pressure will remove any stubborn dirt and algae but leave the decking surface unharmed. If your decking has any chips or cracks in the wooden surface make sure to completely avoid these. Outdoor furniture For wooden outdoor furniture, set your washer to 1,200 PSI using a 25-degree nozzle. For metal and plastic furniture this can be increased to 1,700 PSI. These settings should remove any built-up dirt and grime but leave the surface of the material unharmed. Driveways Similar to paving slabs, a high pressure of 3,000 PSI should be used with a 10-15 degree spray nozzle. This will help to remove any dirt build-up and brighten the surface. A specialised cleaning hood can also be used to stop dirty water or debris from spraying about and causing a mess. Precautions to take when operating a pressure washer A pressure washer is a potent tool that, if misused, can lead to property damage and potential physical harm. The intense water force can erode surfaces and propel smaller objects like stones, causing further damage. Claire advises users to always: Dress appropriately - It's likely you'll get wet and dirty. Avoid wearing open-toed shoes or shorts as the water pressure can kick up small items. Safety goggles are also recommended, along with waterproof trousers and jackets. Test the pressure beforehand - Always conduct a test before beginning your task. Simply spray 2-3 feet away from your intended object to ensure you won't cause any damage. Read the instructions in advance - This might seem self-evident, but no two pressure washers are identical, and while the nozzles are colour-coded by degree level, there's no universal colour scheme for these.", "summary": "Pressure washers can blast away built-up dirt in minutes, but there are some surfaces you should never use them on.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/five-things-you-should-never-32895747", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32895907.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ezgif-1-1f0156f0d0.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:02:39", "author": "Abbie Meehan,Paul Speed", "authors": ["Abbie Meehan", "Paul Speed"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.279}

The adjournment came after Justice Sanjay Kumar recused himself from the case for personal reasons.\n\nThe hearing, initially scheduled for July 11, was to be conducted by a bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Sanjay Karol, and Sanjay Kumar. However, with Justice Kumar stepping down, the case will now be reassigned to a different bench where he is not a member.\n\nJustice Khanna addressed the court, stating, \"Our brother has some difficulty. He will not like to hear this matter for personal reasons.\" Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, representing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), urged the court to expedite the listing of the matter, emphasizing the urgency as the trial has yet to commence in both the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court bench confirmed that the case would be taken up by another bench on July 15. This development follows the court's earlier refusal on June 4 to entertain Sisodia's bail pleas in the CBI and ED cases related to the alleged Delhi liquor policy scam.\n\nManish Sisodia had previously approached the Supreme Court, challenging the Delhi High Court's decision on May 21, which dismissed his bail pleas in both central agency investigations. He also contested a trial court's April 30 order that rejected his bail applications concerning alleged irregularities in the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy for 2021-22.\n\nLast year, on October 30, the Supreme Court denied bail to Sisodia in corruption and money laundering cases linked to the Delhi excise policy. The court cited evidence tentatively supporting accusations of \"windfall gains\" of ?338 crore to wholesale liquor dealers.\n\nSisodia was arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for his alleged involvement in the liquor policy case, followed by his arrest by the ED on March 9, 2023, on money laundering charges stemming from the CBI FIR. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://lagatar24.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/manish-sisodia-062257600-16x9.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714201", "eventUri": "eng-9714201", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 319}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 1044, "textEnd": 1051}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1109, "textEnd": 1115}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1331, "textEnd": 1337}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 1443, "textEnd": 1451}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 1596, "textEnd": 1606}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

It is a revival because the court kept the matter in abeyance,\" said Singhvi, adding that July 23 is shown as the tentative date of listing and an email seeking urgent listing of application seeking revival of bail pleas has also been sent to the registry.\n\nAt this, CJI Chandrachud said, \"I will attend the email the moment we rise. It will not be deleted.\"\n\nLast month, the apex court had disposed of Sisodia's plea seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, the second highest law officer of the Centre, made an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.\n\nEarlier, the Delhi High Court had denied bail to the senior AAP leader, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nA bench of Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma of the High Court, however, clarified that he could continue to meet his ailing wife every week, on the same terms as set earlier by the trial court.\n\nIn March, the Supreme Court dismissed the curative petitions filed by Sisodia against the dismissal of his review pleas against its 2023 verdict denying him bail in connection with the liquor policy case.\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30, 2023, the top court denied bail to Sisodia but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30, refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail a second time. During the trial court's decision to deny bail, it was noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nMeanwhile, a Delhi court last week extended till July 15 the judicial custody of Sisodia in the excise policy case being probed by the ED.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

The ED arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023.\n\nHe resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111656331,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-53202,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714201", "eventUri": "eng-9714201", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 171, "textEnd": 178, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1198, "textEnd": 1204}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1443, "textEnd": 1449}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 1603, "textEnd": 1611}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 1801, "textEnd": 1811}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

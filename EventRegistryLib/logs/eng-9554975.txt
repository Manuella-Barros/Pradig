Squires dismissed aid agency criticism that over 240 air drops carried out by a 12-country coalition led by Jordan and including German, U.S., UAE and Egyptian forces had a negligible impact and do not provide relief for those hardest hit.\n\n\"...Every bag of flour every bit of water matters and could be life-saving... To a starving Palestinian on the ground, every drop of aid is precious, everything we do matters,\" he added. Israel has launched a massive assault on Gaza, killing nearly 35,000 Palestinians, local health authorities say, in a bombardment that has reduced the enclave to a wasteland. The offensive followed an attack on Israel in October that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures.\n\nSquires said surveillance from cockpits and detailed planning ensured that the aid packages landed in the safest places for Palestinians to reach them. There have been several deaths from parachute failure when air-dropped aid fell on Gazans waiting for them. Britain was also helping efforts to speed up the operation of a Cyprus-inspired maritime corridor where a pier that will be placed off the Gaza coast could be operational very soon, the vice-marshal said.\n\n\"There is a huge effort to make it happen...

But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order.\n\n\"We continue to look at all options on the table,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One on Monday evening.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nTrump's campaign said in a statement that the order would not be effective and that if \"Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen.\"\n\nTrump, describing illegal border crossings as an \"invasion,\" is trying to blame Biden for recent incidents of migrants being charged with violent crimes, though many studies have shown that immigrants typically commit violent crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nThe White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nPadilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar said. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would've taken executive action a long time ago and said that cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar said. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can. We did add a lot more money into ICE so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Fatima Hussein on Air Force One contributed to this report.",

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would reopen for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nRelated Story: China and US Resume Cooperation on Deportation as Chinese Immigrants Rush in ...\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order.\n\n\"We continue to look at all options on the table,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One on Monday evening.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nTrump's campaign said in a statement that the order would not be effective and that if \"Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen.\"\n\nTrump, describing illegal border crossings as an \"invasion,\" is trying to blame Biden for recent incidents of migrants being charged with violent crimes, though many studies have shown that immigrants typically commit violent crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S.\n\nRelated Story: As Border Debate Shifts Right, Sen. Alex Padilla Emerges as Persistent ...\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nThe White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nPadilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\nRelated Story: Will the New Mexican President Visit Fresno?

Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico.

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\n\"He is trying to achieve with this executive order part of what would have been achieved by the bill, the bipartisan bill that was rejected by the Republicans and Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. He said he was briefed on the pending directive.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from that bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but that he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme

Cowen is headed to Washington on Tuesday, June 4, when Biden is expected to announce an executive order that will mark his latest and most aggressive plan to curtail the number of migrants allowed to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is telling lawmakers that President Joe Biden is preparing to sign off on an executive order that would shut down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters hits 2,500 at ports of entry, with the border reopening only once that number declines to 1,500, according to several people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe impact of the 2,500 figure means that the executive order could go into immediate effect, because daily figures are higher than that now.\n\nThe Democratic president is expected to unveil the actions -- his most aggressive unilateral move yet to control the numbers at the border -- at the White House on Tuesday at an event to which border mayors have been invited.\n\nFive people familiar with the discussions on Monday confirmed the 2,500 figure, while two of the people confirmed the 1,500 number. The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\n\"He is trying to achieve with this executive order part of what would have been achieved by the bill, the bipartisan bill that was rejected by the Republicans and Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. He said he was briefed on the pending directive.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from that bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but that he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme

Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nPadilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement.

Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can?

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\n\"He is trying to achieve with this executive order part of what would have been achieved by the bill, the bipartisan bill that was rejected by the Republicans and Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. He said he was briefed on the pending directive.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from that bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrives on Marine One at Delaware Air National Guard Base in New Castle, Del., Sunday, June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but that he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\n\"He is trying to achieve with this executive order part of what would have been achieved by the bill, the bipartisan bill that was rejected by the Republicans and Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. He said he was briefed on the pending directive.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from that bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but that he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nBrownsville Mayor John Cowen delivers remarks during a visit to the southern border, Feb. 29, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas, as President Joe Biden looks on. Photo / AP\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would reopen for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order.\n\n\"We continue to look at all options on the table,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One on Monday evening.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nThe White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nPadilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar said. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Fatima Hussein on Air Force One contributed to this report.",

Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Biden's executive order could go into effect right away, allowing border officers to return migrants across the border into Mexico or to their home countries within hours or days.\n\nThe border would reopen to asylum-seekers only when the number of crossings falls significantly. The figure would have to stay below a daily average of 1,500 for seven days in a row. The border would reopen to migrants two weeks after that.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to challenge the executive action in court.\n\n\"The administration has left us little choice but to sue,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the ACLU, which led the charge against the Trump administration's attempt to block asylum in 2018 and resulted in the policy being stopped by federal courts. \"It was unlawful under Trump and is no less illegal now.\"\n\nBiden's move shows how drastically immigration politics have shifted in the United States. Polls suggest there is support in both parties for border measures once denounced by Democrats and championed by Trump as the number of people crossing into the country has reached record levels in recent years.\n\nThere would be limited exceptions, including for minors who cross the border alone, victims of human trafficking and those who use a Customs and Border Protection app to schedule an appointment with a border officer to request asylum.\n\nBut for the most part, the order suspends longtime guarantees that give anyone who steps onto U.S. soil the right to seek a safe haven. Typically, migrants claiming asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances, where they can plead their cases. A huge backlog means those cases can take years to come up.\n\nThe executive action mirrors a bipartisan bill that had some of the most significant border security restrictions Congress had considered in years. But Republicans thwarted the bill in February, saying it was not strong enough. Many of them, egged on by Trump, were loath to give Biden a legislative victory in an election year.\n\n\"Donald Trump begged them to vote 'no' because he was worried that more border enforcement would hurt him politically,\" Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement Tuesday. He added: \"The American people want bipartisan solutions to border security -- not cynical politics.\"\n\nImmigration advocates and some progressive Democrats have expressed concern that Biden was abandoning his promise to rebuild the asylum system.\n\n\"By reviving Trump's asylum ban, President Biden has undermined American values and abandoned our nation's obligations to provide people fleeing persecution, violence and authoritarianism with an opportunity to seek refuge in the U.S.,\" said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.\n\nTuesday's decision is a stark turnaround for Biden, who came into office attacking Trump for his efforts to restrict asylum. During a 2019 debate, Biden, then a candidate running against Trump for the first time, excoriated his rival's policies.\n\n\"This is the first president in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nTrump tried several times to close the U.S. border to asylum-seekers, succeeding only in 2020 when he used a COVID-era emergency rule to seal the border to most migrants.\n\nIn a call with reporters, Biden administration officials bristled at the idea that the president's executive order is comparable to Trump's actions. They emphasized that Biden's administration would only turn away asylum-seekers during periods of surging crossings.\n\nImmigration has proved to be a huge political vulnerability for Biden, reaching a crisis in December, when about 10,000 people a day were making their way into the United States.\n\nBiden administration officials, panicked over those numbers, pressed Mexico to do more to curb migration. Mexican officials have since used charter flights and buses to move migrants farther south and away from the United States.\n\nThe number of people crossing has plunged since then, though the numbers are still historically high. On Sunday, more than 3,500 people crossed without authorization, in line with the trends of recent weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the data.\n\nEven with the executive order in place, migrants could still apply for other protections designed for those who can prove they will be tortured in their home country. But that screening has a much higher bar than asylum and as a result, administration officials said they do not expect many migrants to be screened into the United States.\n\nPeople who cross illegally and do not qualify for those other protections would be subject to a five-year ban for entering the United States.\n\nWhite House officials believe the order provides Biden an opportunity to take Republicans to task for dooming the bipartisan bill. That legislation also would have provided billions to the Department of Homeland Security for more border officers and immigration judges.\n\nBiden cannot provide those resources through executive action. White House officials for weeks said they preferred legislation over presidential proclamation because it would more lasting and less exposed to a court challenge.\n\nThe order also comes with some political risks. Republicans have questioned why Biden did not take unilateral action at the border sooner. In January, he told reporters that he had \"done all I can do\" at the border and that he needed help from Congress.\n\n\"It's window dressing. Everybody knows it,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said of the president's order at a news conference Tuesday morning. \"If he was concerned about the border, he would have done this a long time ago.\"\n\nAs Biden considered whether to take executive action in recent months, his administration has taken smaller steps to try to control those backlogs.\n\nIn May, the administration proposed a rule change that would allow officers to quickly identify people who are ineligible for asylum, such as those who have been convicted of serious crimes. Currently, they may be allowed to enter the country and wait months, or often years, for asylum proceedings. The proposal must go through a 30-day public comment period.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also issued a new policy in May instructing asylum officers to consider whether applicants could find refuge in their own countries before coming to the United States.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The impact of the 2,500 figure means that the executive order could go into immediate effect because daily figures are higher than that now.\n\nThe Democratic president unveiled the actions - his most aggressive unilateral move yet to control the numbers at the border - at the White House on June 4 at an event to which border mayors have been invited.\n\nFive people familiar with the discussions on June 3 confirmed the 2,500 figure, while two of the people confirmed the 1,500 number. The figures are daily averages over the course of a week.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would reopen for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on June 4. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held June 2, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Mr. Biden said in a statement on June 3 that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone on June 3, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order.\n\n\"We continue to look at all options on the table,\" Mr. Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Mr. Biden on Air Force One on the evening of June 3.\n\nThe executive order will allow Mr. Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Mr. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nMr. Trump's campaign said in a statement that the order would not be effective and that if \"Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen.\"\n\nMr. Trump, describing illegal border crossings as an \"invasion,\" is trying to blame Mr. Biden for recent incidents of migrants being charged with violent crimes, though many studies have shown that immigrants typically commit violent crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S.\n\nFor Mr. Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Mr. Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Mr. Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the [executive order] before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Mr. Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as [it] did when the Mr. Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nThe White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nMr. Padilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Mr. Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nMr. Biden unveiled his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Mr. Cuellar said. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them [to Mexico], or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Mr. Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Ms. Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than [Title 42], while still putting people in harm's way,\" Ms. Babaie said.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nVideo below: 'People risked everything': First responders share experiences from the US - Mexico border\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nThe White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nPadilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nVideo below: 'Do something to stop it;' Town residents blast plan to turn Massachusetts prison into migrant facility\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar said. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.", "source": {"uri": "kcra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCRA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kcra.com", "name":

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nClamping down on asylum\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions.

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week.\n\nThe Democratic president unveiled the actions -- his most aggressive unilateral move yet to control the numbers at the border -- at the White House on Tuesday at an event to which border mayors have been invited.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would reopen for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order.\n\n\"We continue to look at all options on the table,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One on Monday evening.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nThe White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Sen. Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy.\"\n\nPadilla, who was briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the United States. In recent weeks, Padilla has also pressed the White House for executive actions that benefit immigrants and said the message he has heard in return is, \"We're working on it.\"\n\nBiden unveiled the executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would have taken executive action a long time ago and said cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar said. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can? We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.\n\n--", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The long-anticipated move, which relies on an authority previously invoked by the Trump administration to restrict immigration, will allow border officials to temporarily suspend asylum processing between official ports of entry and swiftly return migrants to neighboring Mexico and countries of origin at times when crossings rise to a certain threshold. The directive, which mirrors a now-defunct Senate border deal, is set to go into effect on Tuesday at midnight.\n\n\"President Biden believes we must secure our border,\" a White House statement reads. \"That is why today, he announced executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. These actions will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the Southern Border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today.\"\n\nThis latest and likely most drastic crackdown on asylum by a Democratic president in recent years comes at a time when migrant encounters at the southern border are in decline after record-breaking levels of migration. The move consolidates President Biden's marked rightward shift on immigration and signals how far the administration is willing to go to rebut Republicans and Donald Trump's \"open borders\" accusations. Critics and advocates say that, in trying to come on top of a sticky electoral issue ahead of the November vote, Biden might just end up outdoing his opponent's hardline record by gutting access to asylum.\n\n\"It's notable to see the White House prep a POTUS event on policies that Dems used to call illegal,\" Andrea R. Flores, who once served as director for border management on Biden's National Security Council, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, prior to the announcement. \"Pundits will say this is a smart move to the center on immigration, but this issue has moved so far to the right that Dems are embracing extreme asylum bans even when border numbers are down.\"\n\nThe executive order is based on section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which allows the president to suspend the entry of foreigners if \"detrimental to the interests\" of the United States. The directive places a cap on the processing of asylum claims and migrants that would be triggered once unlawful border crossings reach an average of 2,500 per day over a week. The partial ban would only be lifted 14 days after the weekly average of daily encounters fall to 1,500.\n\nLast month, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded a daily average of 3,700 encounters between ports of entry -- a significant decrease from the 8,000 registered in December, but still high enough to set off the border closure. The executive order, which includes exemptions for unaccompanied minors and migrants fleeing imminent harm, is likely to prompt legal challenges -- and potential court orders blocking the effort -- similar to the ones the Trump administration faced.\n\nThe timing of the policy move follows the results of the presidential elections in Mexico that saw Claudia Sheinbaum, a protege of outgoing leader Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, elected the country's first woman president. The recent drop in migrant crossings into the United States is due in no small part to the Mexican government's increased clampdown on migration. The return of migrants and asylum seekers per the executive order would inevitably require Mexico's cooperation.\n\nAlmost since the moment Biden took office having vowed to restore \"moral leadership\" on immigration, he has been hit with a barrage of attacks from Republicans determined to weaponize the immigration debate to score political points. Despite calls from advocates and immigration experts to espouse an openly pro-immigrant agenda and underscore a fundamental contrast between Biden and Trump, the administration and Democrats have instead gradually ceded ground to the right.\n\n\"This is a dark day for the Biden administration,\" Azadeh Erfani, senior policy analyst at the National Immigrant Justice Center, said. \"After campaigning on restoring asylum access, Biden is now fully embracing Trump's policies as his own, including now using the same statute that led to the Muslim and African bans.\" This crackdown on asylum, she added, is unlikely to have the intended effect of managing the border. \"If we learned anything from the Trump years,\" Erfani said, \"it is that even the cruelest policies cannot succeed in \"deterring\" people fleeing for their lives.\"\n\nIn January, Biden had already promised to \"shut down\" the border when calling on Congress to pass a restrictive bipartisan Senate border deal that primarily delivered on Republicans' border enforcement priorities. The proposed bill, which Trump successfully torpedoed to keep the border a salient issue he can hammer on to appeal to his base, has twice failed to gain enough support. Most recently, Senate Republicans -- including Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the champions of the original bipartisan push -- blocked a renewed attempt by Democrats at passing a deal, decrying it as political theater.\n\nWith lawmakers from both parties playing the blame game, Biden has latched on Republicans' obstruction as a campaign target. \"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system,\" Biden said in a May statement after the border deal. \"If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history.\" In the process, he is doubling down on the enforcement-first rhetoric to claim, \"I've done all I can do.\"", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday, reported Associated Press.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the US would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order. The president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico. Biden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the US president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples\". The two spoke on the phone Monday, although White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether they spoke about the pending order, reported Associated Press.\n\n\"We continue to look at all options on the table,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One on Monday evening. The executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections. For Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from the bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the US Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day. Administration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the US if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president. That has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court, reported Associated Press.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. The White House is also sure to encounter vocal resistance from many Democratic lawmakers. California Senator Alex Padilla, an outspoken critic of the Senate's earlier border bill, said the pending executive order was \"just not the solution we need and it's very incomplete as a strategy\". Padilla, who was also briefed by the White House on the proposal, wants an approach that works with countries throughout Latin America to address the poverty and unrest that drives migration to the US. Rep Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who said he was briefed on the plan, said he wishes the White House would've taken executive action a long time ago and said that cooperation from Mexico would continue to be critical as the administration implements the order. \"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar said.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news",

Sign in\n\nYou are logged in\n\nSwitch accounts\n\nThe Democratic president is expected to unveil the actions -- his most aggressive unilateral move yet to control the numbers at the border -- at the White House on Tuesday at an event to which border mayors have been invited.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFive people familiar with the discussions on Monday confirmed the 2,500 figure, while two of the people confirmed the 1,500 number. The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday.\n\nYou might be interested in\n\nPeterborough And Area News\n\nDec 31, 1969\n\nPeterborough And Area News\n\nDec 31, 1969\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\n\"He is trying to achieve with this executive order part of what would have been achieved by the bill, the bipartisan bill that was rejected by the Republicans and Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. He said he was briefed on the pending directive.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from that bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but that he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat contributed to this report from San Diego.", "source": {"uri":

President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Tuesday, June 4, that would allow him to temporarily seal the U.S. border with Mexico to migrants when crossings surge and suspend longtime protections for asylum seekers in the United States. (Christopher Lee/The New York Times)\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday allowing him to temporarily seal the U.S. border with Mexico to migrants when crossings surge, a move that would suspend longtime protections for asylum-seekers in the United States.\n\nBiden's senior aides have told members of Congress in recent days to expect him to sign the order at the White House alongside mayors from south Texas, according to several people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe restrictions would kick in once the number of illegal crossings exceeds 2,500 in a day, according to several people who have been briefed on the order. Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Biden's executive order could go into effect immediately.\n\nThe border would reopen to asylum-seekers if the number of crossings stays below 1,500 for a certain period of time, the people said. They asked for anonymity because the executive order has not been officially announced.\n\nThe order would be the most restrictive border policy instituted by Biden, or any other modern Democrat, and echoes an effort in 2018 by President Donald Trump to curb migration that Democrats assailed and federal courts blocked.\n\nAlthough the executive action is almost certain to face legal challenges, Biden is under intense political pressure to address illegal immigration, a top concern of voters before the presidential election in November.\n\nThe decision shows how the politics of immigration have shifted sharply to the right over the course of Biden's presidency. Polls suggest growing support -- even in the president's party -- for border measures that Democrats once denounced and Trump championed.\n\nTypically, migrants claiming asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances, where can they can plead their cases. But a huge backlog means those cases can take years to come up.\n\nProponents of the order say it will help relieve pressure on an overwhelmed system. There would be limited exceptions, however, including minors who cross the border alone, people experiencing medical emergencies and victims of human trafficking, according to several officials briefed on the order.\n\nMigrants could also apply for other protections, aside from asylum -- but those programs are already significantly more difficult to qualify for. And the administration is designing new screening processes that will make the bar even harder to clear.\n\nThe number of people illegally crossing the border has plunged in recent months after reaching record highs in December, when about 10,000 people a day were making their way into the United States.\n\nBiden administration officials, panicked over the numbers in December, pressed Mexico to do more to curb migration. Mexican officials have since used charter flights and buses to move migrants deeper south and away from the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, border agents apprehended more than 3,500 people crossing without authorization, in line with the trends of recent weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the data.\n\nThe executive action is likely to mirror a measure in a failed bipartisan bill this year that had some of the most significant border security restrictions Congress had considered in years. The bill would have provided billions in funding for the border, including for the hiring of thousands of asylum officers to process claims.\n\nBut Republicans thwarted the bill in February, saying it was not strong enough. Many of them, egged on by Trump, were loath to give Biden a legislative victory in an election year. The president's aides hope the executive order will provide him with an opportunity to hammer Republicans for their decision to kill the bipartisan bill, which would have provided billions of dollars to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"While congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement Monday. He did not confirm the plans but said the administration was exploring \"a series of policy options, and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union led the charge against the Trump administration's attempt to block asylum in 2018, which resulted in the policy being stopped by federal courts. The group has signaled that it is ready to challenge any order that limits asylum at the border.\n\n\"We will need to review the EO before deciding on litigation, but any policy that effectively cuts off protection for desperate migrants would raise serious legal problems, as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the ACLU who led the challenge against many of Trump's policies.\n\nWhile Republicans have long assailed Democrats over border security, Biden in recent years has also faced calls by members of his party for stronger enforcement.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., who won a special House election this year partly by calling for stricter immigration measures, sent a letter to Biden last month encouraging him to issue an executive order that would restrict asylum.\n\n\"I think it's very, very important, not only for Democrats or for political purposes, but it's important for America,\" Suozzi said in an interview. \"This is something the people are very concerned about.\"\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who has previously called on the president to bolster enforcement at the border, said he had been briefed on the order.\n\n\"While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far,\" he said.\n\nStill, there are political risks to issuing the order. Republicans have in recent days questioned why Biden did not take unilateral action at the border sooner. In January, he told reporters that he had \"done all I can do\" at the border and that he needed help from Congress.\n\n\"The American people know better,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote in a social media post Monday.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type":

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday.

Details of the order are still fluid but it's expected to go into effect Wednesday. It would include a provision to allow asylum petitions to resume when crossings fall back to a daily average of 1,500, the people said.\n\nAsylum claims will still be processed at ports of entry under the order, and there will be exceptions. The Biden administration is currently processing roughly 1,500 migrants a day, mostly those who have an appointment via a phone app set up by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The new order will not apply to unaccompanied minors.\n\nThe executive action is similar to a provision in the bipartisan border bill that failed in Congress at the behest of Donald Trump, who did not want Biden to score a political victory -- potentially blunting Republican criticism that the president has failed to secure the border amid a sharp increase in the number of people seeking asylum.\n\nThe announcement of the new policy, which could help vulnerable down-ballot candidates as well as Biden, comes just weeks before the president and Trump are scheduled to hold their first debate.\n\n\"I'm excited to see what the president's executive order contains. This is a very important issue that people are concerned about and Congress' failure to act has forced the president to take executive action,\" Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) said in an interview. \"The most effective elected official or politician is the one who says what the people are thinking already. And the people are concerned about the border. It's not a Republican issue. It's an American issue.\"\n\nRamiro Garza, Jr. mayor Edinburg, Texas and the chair of the South Texas Alliance of Cities, will also be at Tuesday's event -- one of a number of local officials who have worked with the administration to develop a response to the increase in migrants.\n\n\"I'm sure there are going to be different opinions about this. But at least from my standpoint, putting this back into the conversation -- for us to really look at this and do something about it -- I see it as a positive effort because otherwise, at this point, because of an election year, I just don't see any action by Congress,\" he said.\n\nIn recent months, the president and his senior aides have become increasingly concerned about the high number of border crossings, worries that have intensified with the political pressure of an election year. After the failed border bill, aides landed on a policy that will drastically shape the asylum system, as well as the Democratic party's ideology on an issue that has challenged the last several administrations.\n\nThe decision to do so resembled a reversal by the president. Having stepped into the White House vowing to fix America's broken immigration system after four years of Trump, he has settled on an approach likely to draw criticism from progressives and immigration advocates.\n\n\"This should definitely not be the new Democratic position when it comes to border and immigration. From what we've heard, it's not just paralleling some of the elements of the bill but it's paralleling some of the elements of what the Trump administration tried to do unsuccessfully,\" said Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.)\n\nBut White House officials believe voters will reward the president for cracking down on the border. They view the February special election of Suozzi, who ran on strengthening border security, as further evidence that the president's policy and rhetorical shift will pay electoral benefits. At least a dozen lawmakers will be at the White House on Tuesday, including Suozzi, who along with other Democrats have called on the president to use this authority to clamp down on the border.\n\n\"This step from the Biden Administration will help us start to get the situation at the border under control, but Congress must take action on a more permanent fix,\" said Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.), who led a letterlast month with other lawmakers asking for an executive order. \"I welcome any additional action from the president on this issue in the meantime.\"\n\nEven the metric the administration settled on did not disguise Biden officials' efforts to address GOP criticism. Administration officials decided on a figure more stringent than the average of 4,000 daily crossings used in the bipartisan border deal in an effort to preempt Republicans accusing Biden of encouraging thousands of migrants to approach the border before it was shut down.\n\nWhile a handful of Democrats, many of them in politically vulnerable seats, have asked the administration to take action, progressives and immigration advocates have criticized any limits on asylum, which is a safeguard to vulnerable people guaranteed under U.S. law.\n\n\"The Biden administration is trying to thread the needle with meeting the political moment of what Americans are saying they want -- greater order at the border -- while at the same time maintaining a fair process at the border. And they're not going to be able to do a perfect job of that right now. It's likely that this new process is going to turn away asylum seekers and deny them a fair opportunity to seek asylum,\" said Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nImmigration policy experts warn that the policy change will do little to resolve the crisis at the border. Even with the administration's efforts to curtail asylum seekers during spikes in crossings, smugglers and traffickers will continue to target nationalities -- like Cubans, Venezuelans and Colombians -- that can't be easily removed to countries that haven't consistently accepted deportation flights from the U.S. or Mexico. They also warn that triggered border shutdowns tied to a specific number of illegal crossings will lead to more erratic surges at the border in isolated areas, upending Border Patrol's security posture.\n\nThere also remain questions about the policy's fate. Many immigration policy experts expect the action to be stalled by legal challenges, potentially making its way to the Supreme Court. At that point, the administration would be able to show Biden exhausted his options, while once again pointing the finger at Congress.\n\n\"Assuming it'll get enjoined in the courts, they'll just go back to Congress and say, 'look we tried to do this administratively, and it didn't work,'\" said one person familiar with the administration's planning.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

But it seems his tune has changed amid plans to take unilateral action to address the crisis with just five months until the presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to announce as early as Tuesday an executive order that would limit the number of migrants able to cross the southern border every day if it reaches 4,000 per day\n\nDespite the block at the border on crossings, the U.S. will continue to allow asylum applicants to make appointments at border ports of entry using a mobile app known as CBP One.\n\nBiden's Department of Homeland Security currently accepts about 1,400 migrants every day through that program.\n\nRepublicans claim that the executive action is a 'stunt' and insist Biden is finally taking action because he was forced to face the reality of how important the border and illegal immigration is to voters heading to the polls in November.\n\n'Don't be deceived by Biden's latest move on the border, which is nothing more than a political stunt,' Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) posted to X. 'He's trying to appear tough on immigration because he's losing ground in the polls.'\n\nHe added: 'Remember, he's already let in over 10 million illegal aliens, and his new executive order will likely lead to at least 1.5 million more illegal crossings in the next year.'\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also wrote on X: 'This is an election-year stunt that won't distract voters from Joe Biden's disastrous, failed immigration policies.'\n\nBiden's order would echo policies former President Donald Trump started using in 2018 to block illegal immigration at the southern border - a policy that was challenged several times by Democrats in federal courts.\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) says it's 'too little, too late' to address the issue now - claiming that Biden and his DHS Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, have taken 64 other actions that have further opened the southern border and exacerbated the illegal immigration crisis.\n\nIt comes after years of pressure from Republicans demanding action to quell the southern border crisis and only five months ahead of November's election. Pictured: Migrants wait between Mexico and El Paso, Texas to claim asylum in the U.S.\n\nPreviously, Biden's White House asked Congress to pass new laws to expand the presidential authority over the border. The Democratic administration claims that Congress needs to act to allow action to address the issue.\n\nA bipartisan border deal failed to take off earlier this year and the Senate voted again in May gainst the border measure, with both Democrats and Republicans teaming up against it.\n\nThe plan now is for Biden to enact parts of the Senate deal unilaterally, including denying entrance to migrants after certain thresholds are hit.\n\nThe sources said that, specifically, the White House is weighing a policy that would cap the number of migrant encounters at 4,000 per day over a week - 28,000 in total.\n\nWhat would happen when that threshold is hit is unclear.\n\nA similar policy was at the heart of the failed Senate deal, but Republicans slammed the measure for not doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nThe White House expects to use authority from Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to go forward with Biden's executive order.\n\nA group of about 100 migrants is removed by the National Guard back to Mexico near El Paso, Texas on May 30. Under Joe Biden, nearly 8 million migrants have come into the U.S. in just three-and-a-half years\n\nBiden is apparently thinking of using section 212(f) to restrict migration, which does not require congressional approval\n\nThat law provides presidents leeway in blocking entry of certain immigrants if it would be 'detrimental' to national interests.\n\nFormer President Trump repeatedly leaned on that section of the law to shut-out certain immigrants crossing illegally and seeking asylum at the southern border.\n\nPresidents using section 212(f) to restrict migration does not require congressional approval.\n\nBut Biden has repeatedly said he wants new laws from Congress to fix the border.\n\nPushing for the passage of the twice-defeated Senate bill, Biden said in January 'It would give me, as President, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed.'\n\n'And if given that authority, I would use it the day I sign the bill into law,' his January statement continued.\n\nBut it appears that the White House has since decided that they can go it alone, as Republicans have charged, and will enact reform this week, though the timing of the reported executive action is opaque.\n\nThe administration has reportedly looking to use this power for months - and now sources say that this week an executive order could come down the pipeline.\n\nThe White House 'continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system,' spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez recently.\n\n'While congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,' he added.\n\nBut when asked about Biden's election year border policy reversal on Sunday, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson slammed the administration's mulled move, saying it's 'too little too late.'\n\n'He's trying to desperately show the American people that he wants to address the issue that he himself created,' Johnson said.\n\n'We documented 64 specific actions that President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas at DHS took over ... the course of three and a half years, beginning on the first day that President Biden [took office], to open the border.'\n\n'They did it intentionally, it's had catastrophic effects upon our country that we'll be living with for decades to come.'\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson claims that Biden has 'engineered' the migrant crisis and says it's 'too little, too late' to take action\n\nJohnson has spent his few months in power lobbying the White House to take an executive action on the border.\n\nAnd now that they are, he claimed that it's only coming because it's an election year.\n\n'He wants to issue some sort of executive order, I guess to show that, oh he really does care about the issue,' Johnson said. 'The only reason he's doing that is because the polls say that it's the biggest issue in America.'\n\n'And the first question that comes up in almost every public forum, is what about that open border and why in the world would President Biden allow it? He did more than allow it, he engineered it and everybody knows that.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Biden's executive order could go into effect immediately.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nThe border would reopen to asylum-seekers if the number of crossings stays below 1,500 for a certain period of time, the people said. They asked for anonymity because the executive order has not been officially announced.\n\nThe order would be the most restrictive border policy instituted by Biden, or any other modern Democrat, and echoes an effort in 2018 by President Donald Trump to curb migration that Democrats assailed and federal courts blocked.\n\nAlthough the executive action is almost certain to face legal challenges, Biden is under intense political pressure to address illegal immigration, a top concern of voters before the presidential election in November.\n\nThe decision shows how the politics of immigration have shifted sharply to the right over the course of Biden's presidency. Polls suggest growing support -- even in the president's party -- for border measures that Democrats once denounced and Trump championed.\n\nTypically, migrants claiming asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances, where can they can plead their cases. But a huge backlog means those cases can take years to come up.\n\nProponents of the order say it will help relieve pressure on an overwhelmed system. There would be limited exceptions, however, including minors who cross the border alone, people experiencing medical emergencies and victims of human trafficking, according to several officials briefed on the order.\n\nMigrants could also apply for other protections, aside from asylum -- but those programs are already significantly more difficult to qualify for. And the administration is designing new screening processes that will make the bar even harder to clear.\n\nThe number of people illegally crossing the border has plunged in recent months after reaching record highs in December, when about 10,000 people a day were making their way into the United States.\n\nBiden administration officials, panicked over the numbers in December, pressed Mexico to do more to curb migration. Mexican officials have since used charter flights and buses to move migrants deeper south and away from the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, border agents apprehended more than 3,500 people crossing without authorization, in line with the trends of recent weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the data.\n\nThe executive action is likely to mirror a measure in a failed bipartisan bill this year that had some of the most significant border security restrictions Congress had considered in years. The bill would have provided billions in funding for the border, including for the hiring of thousands of asylum officers to process claims.\n\nBut Republicans thwarted the bill in February, saying it was not strong enough. Many of them, egged on by Trump, were loath to give Biden a legislative victory in an election year. The president's aides hope the executive order will provide him with an opportunity to hammer Republicans for their decision to kill the bipartisan bill, which would have provided billions of dollars to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"While congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement Monday. He did not confirm the plans but said the administration was exploring \"a series of policy options, and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nAdministration officials have said that executive action was not their preference and that they believe any order would face a legal challenge.\n\n\"Legislation is what is needed,\" Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, said last month.\n\n\"Executive action will be challenged,\" he added. \"I am confident in that. And then the question will be: What is the outcome of those proceedings? Legislation is a more certain delivery of solution.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union led the charge against the Trump administration's attempt to block asylum in 2018, which resulted in the policy being stopped by federal courts. The group has signaled that it is ready to challenge any order that limits asylum at the border.\n\n\"We will need to review the EO before deciding on litigation, but any policy that effectively cuts off protection for desperate migrants would raise serious legal problems, as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the ACLU who led the challenge against many of Trump's policies.\n\nWhile Republicans have long assailed Democrats over border security, Biden in recent years has also faced calls by members of his party for stronger enforcement.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., who won a special House election this year partly by calling for stricter immigration measures, sent a letter to Biden last month encouraging him to issue an executive order that would restrict asylum.\n\n\"I think it's very, very important, not only for Democrats or for political purposes, but it's important for America,\" Suozzi said in an interview. \"This is something the people are very concerned about.\"\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who has previously called on the president to bolster enforcement at the border, said he had been briefed on the order.\n\n\"While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far,\" he said.\n\nStill, there are political risks to issuing the order. Republicans have in recent days questioned why Biden did not take unilateral action at the border sooner. In January, he told reporters that he had \"done all I can do\" at the border and that he needed help from Congress.\n\n\"The American people know better,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote in a social media post Monday.\n\nIn a sign of just how much the politics on the issue has changed, Biden, as a candidate in 2019, excoriated Trump's policies during a debate.\n\n\"This is the first president in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country,\" Biden said at the time. \"That's never happened before.\n\n\"You come to the United States, and you make your case,\" he added. \"That's how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.

GOP lawmakers contended that it would still allow thousands of illegal border crossings each day.\n\n\"President Biden believes we must secure our border. That is why today, he will announce actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" a senior White House official said on a Tuesday morning call with reporters.\n\n\"These actions will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the southern border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today,\" the senior official added. \"They will make it easier for immigration officers to remove those without a lawful basis to remain and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents.\"\n\nThe order would not go as far as a bipartisan border security package the White House negotiated with senators from both parties -- including lead GOP negotiator Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the chamber's most conservative members.\n\n\"Congress must still act,\" the senior official said, blaming House Republicans for blocking the Senate package and contending that the order's language is close to some provisions in that legislation.\n\nWith Election Day five months away, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans have been hammering Biden over what they call an \"open border.\" Biden has faced political attacks that bad actors are flowing into the country, bring criminal activity, drugs and even terrorist attack plots.\n\nBiden's top aides have been pressed by GOP lawmakers for months to take action, and they've been peppered with questions from reporters about whether the president and his legal counsel had concluded that he had additional options for executive action.\n\nUnder the order, asylum requests from migrants at official ports of entry would not be processed if encounters with people entering illegally exceed 2,500 a day. The action is based on a presidential power dubbed 212(f).\n\nFederal authorities have reported record levels of illegal migrant apprehensions for three consecutive years. And while those numbers are sharply down this year, the issue remains a political anchor for Biden.\n\nSenate Republicans largely attributed Tuesday's announcement to election year politics.\n\n\"This is like turning a garden hose on a five-alarm fire. And the American people are not fools. They know that this play is too little, too late,\" Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor.\n\nTexas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, responding to the president's expected actions ahead of the formal announcement, said Biden should not have changed the policies of his predecessor.\n\n\"President Biden and the Democrats have a press conference, and here's what they're announcing: He could have stopped this every single day of his presidency,\" Cruz said. \"When he signs this executive order, the only question anyone should ask is why didn't you do this in 2021? Why don't you do this in 2022? Why didn't you do this in 2023?\"\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called the Biden administration border security actions \"a joke\" and said, \"You know what, I think we're going to have to wait until January when President Trump comes back into office to actually see something done about it.\"\n\nRep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, was not sold on the EO before it was even made public by the White House.\n\n\"Spoiler alert: The 'drastic border action' is to legalize 4,000 illegal border crossings every day,\" he wrote Monday on social media platform X. \"Joe Biden isn't serious about securing the border.\"\n\nA Gallup poll released April 30 showed that more Americans, 27 percent, cited immigration as the top issue facing the U.S., followed by \"government\" at 18 percent and the \"economy in general\" at 17 percent. A Global Strategy Group survey released April 18 found that 52 percent of likely voters said Biden is ignoring border issues, while 50 percent said he has not been focusing enough on illegal migrants. Other polls conducted this year have shown voters giving Republicans higher marks on handling immigration.\n\nThe 212(f) authority might sound familiar: the Trump administration used it as the basis of the so-called \"travel ban\" for individuals trying to enter the country from a handful of Muslim-majority nations.\n\nTrump often criticized Biden's border policies when speaking to reporters outside his New York hush money trial, in which he became the first former U.S. president with a criminal conviction. He and his campaign team have kept doing so since the trial wrapped on Thursday.\n\n\"Joe Biden's Executive Order is for amnesty, not border security,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday in a statement. \"This new order will facilitate the release of more illegals as quickly as possible with a smartphone app. The order also exempts minors from any enforcement, giving a green light to child traffickers and sex traffickers. ... The border invasion and migrant crime will not stop until 'Crooked Joe Biden' is deported from the White House.\"\n\nThe senior White House official told reporters the order would \"significantly increase the speed and scope of consequences\" for migrants who cross the border illegally without a \"reasonable\" asylum request. To that end, when border encounters are high, Biden's order would \"strengthen the asylum system\" by ensuring it is \"not backed up by those who don't have legitimate [asylum] claims.\"\n\nThe president's action does include carve-outs for children and those who have \"legitimate\" fears of persecution or torture if they return to their home country.\n\nTrump, during a Sunday morning interview on Fox News, again proposed a massive deportation campaign of migrants if he is elected in November.\n\n\"I'm going to do the big deportation. The biggest ever,\" he said. \"You'll get rid of 10 really bad ones and one really beautiful mother. ... It's always going to be tough, it's not going to be easy.\" After suggesting for months that he would use National Guard or even active-duty military troops, which would require a congressional waiver, for such an operation, he added a new twist on Fox.\n\n\"The way you get rid of them is the local police,\" Trump said.\n\nLeavitt, the Trump campaign press secretary, contended that Biden could \"shut down the border ... with a swipe of the same pen\" -- though she did not specify under what specific presidential authority he might be able to do so.\n\nBut she did claim that Biden \"never will because he is controlled by radical left Democrats who seek to destroy America.\" The senior White House official noted that it was Republican President Ronald Reagan who called the United States, in his words, a \"beacon of hope\" for migrants from across the globe.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

Officials said Biden's expected order will operate similarly, while agents at the border will continue to face limitations, including a lack of detention space, transportation capacity and asylum officers.\n\nThe failed border legislation would have provided billions in additional funds for deportation capacity and asylum processing, but Republican lawmakers spurned the bill after former president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, came out against it.\n\nBiden has already implemented measures to restrict asylum claims of migrants who cross into the United States illegally, but many continue to be released into the United States because border authorities lack the capacity to detain, screen or deport them. In other cases, migrants' home countries won't take them back or cooperate with U.S. authorities on deportations.\n\n\"The big question for me is whether this will come with additional resources,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. \"Without additional dollars to implement this, the same challenges will remain that each of the past asylum restrictions have faced.\"\n\nMigrants who state a fear of persecution if returned to Mexico will remain eligible under the Convention Against Torture and other protections afforded by U.S. law, according to officials with knowledge of Biden's order.\n\nMexico also places limits on the number of non-Mexican migrants it will accept from the United States.\n\nThe president has been in a political bind over the border, as the issue has become increasingly important for voters. The surge of migration during his term, which has ebbed and flowed but often surpassed record levels, remains one of his largest political liabilities, according to strategists.\n\nTrump has continuously attacked him for what he has described as \"open border\" policies and \"Biden migrant crime,\" pledging to enact a sweeping crackdown if he wins the presidency.\n\n\"Our borders will be closed very soon,\" Trump said Friday, in remarks during which he railed against immigration as well as his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business documents in the New York hush money trial against him.\n\nTrump made a similar attempt to cut off migrants' access to U.S. asylum protections, but the measures were blocked in federal court in 2019. Biden's order is expected to be challenged on similar grounds.\n\n\"We will need to review the executive order before making litigation decisions, but any policy that effectively shuts off asylum would raise obvious legal problems, just as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who was lead counsel on many challenges to Trump's policies, said in an interview Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities have tallied about 2 million illegal crossings per year along the southern border since 2021, the highest levels ever, and migrants have been arriving in record numbers from China, India, Venezuela and dozens of other countries. Often guided to the U.S. border by criminal organizations in Mexico, the migrants typically surrender to U.S. border agents and express a fear of persecution if returned - the first step in seeking U.S. asylum.\n\nBiden's order would render them ineligible for asylum protections if crossings exceed the daily threshold.\n\nCurrent agreements allow the United States to send up to 30,000 non-Mexicans back across the border each month, but Mexico has generally limited returns to Central Americans, Cubans and some Haitians.\n\nMexican voters elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the country's first female leader, by a landslide margin Sunday in a vote that was widely viewed as a referendum on current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Sheinbaum, who will be inaugurated Oct. 1, has vowed to continue L\u00f3pez Obrador's cooperation with the United States on migration.\n\nWhile Biden has increasingly adopted the kind of language embraced by Trump on immigration - including pledging this year to \"shut down\" the border if it becomes overwhelmed by unauthorized crossings - he has struggled to find a message that can satisfy the diverse coalition of voters he is courting.\n\nSeveral liberal lawmakers have criticized Biden for his increasingly tough stance on the border, and pro-immigration activists have accused him of betraying core American ideals and not adopting more humane immigration policies after Trump's turbulent term.\n\n\"The decision by this administration to criminalize migrants - many of whom are fleeing harm - is deeply disturbing and misguided,\" Sarah M. Rich, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement.\n\n\"Prosecuting people seeking safety in the U.S. for these immigration violations will lead to more Black and Brown people being incarcerated at the expense of immigrant families and communities,\" Rich said.\n\nWhite House officials said Biden will continue to explore various policy options to address the migration challenge.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nThe expected executive order is a signal that the plan of some Democrats to hammer Republicans over the failure of the bipartisan border deal opposed by Trump is unlikely to shield them from a barrage of attacks over the issue.\n\nWhen the bill failed the first time in the Senate, Biden pledged to take the message across the country and blame Trump for encouraging lawmakers to kill the agreement.\n\nWhile Biden initially pushed that message in campaign speeches, his focus in recent months has shifted toward figuring out how much he can accomplish without Congress.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston

Legislation is a more certain delivery of solution.\"\n\nStepping up to help Biden is the ACLU, which will once again lead the legal charge against any kind of limits on asylum.\n\n\"We will need to review the E.O. before deciding on litigation, but any policy that effectively cuts off protection for desperate migrants would raise serious legal problems, as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the ACLU.\n\nAssociated Press:\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nMexico has been stepping up enforcement actions on its side of the border, which has slowed illegal crossings into the United States. But what Biden isn't talking about is that the legal justification he's using is exactly the same justification that Trump used to limit border crossings during his administration.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would reopen for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nBiden's use of an executive order is all for show. Once the ACLU and other groups block enforcement of the executive order, Biden can throw up his hands and exclaim, \"I tried! If those mean Republicans would just do as I ask, the situation would be under control!\"\n\nBorder control theater is likely to have an extended run.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick Moran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2021/265/23e18810-0fc1-4e4f-8996-72e407350a81.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 3217, "textEnd": 3226}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

executive order that would allow officials at certain times to deport migrants who cross the border illegally without processing their asylum claims first\n\nWASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden is expected to announce steps Tuesday to close the Mexican border to asylum seekers when numbers surge, in a bid to tackle a key weak spot in his election battle with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, is set to sign a long-awaited executive order that would allow officials at certain times to deport migrants who cross the border illegally without processing their asylum claims first, US media reported.\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president, and see him moving further toward Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue drags on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nAn announcement is expected on Tuesday, sources close to the matter said, although the White House would not confirm reports that Biden will sign the executive order alongside mayors from border towns.\n\n\"What I can say is we are constantly and continuously looking at all options to try and really deal with the immigration system, a system that's been broken for decades,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nJean-Pierre blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to cooperate with Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"They decided to pick partisan politics,\" she said.\n\nBiden's curbs on asylum requests would kick in when illegal crossings hit 2,500 a day, and would not lift until numbers drop back to 1,500, several US media outlets reported.\n\nBut he faces opposition on several fronts.\n\nThe plans could anger some Democrats as they are the toughest by his party for years, and would rely on the use of the same law that Trump's administration used to ban immigration from some Muslim countries.\n\nThey would also almost certainly be challenged in court.\n\nRepublicans have sought to make the border a key issue ahead of the November 5 vote, portraying Biden as soft on stopping what Trump calls an \"invasion\" of migration.\n\nMore than 2.4 million migrants crossed the southern US border in 2023 alone, largely from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\nTrump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and raised the possibility of mass repatriations by the US military and detention camps.\n\nTrump and his allies have also accused Biden of operating an open border policy to boost Democratic voter numbers -- an allegation that Democrats decry as a racist conspiracy theory.\n\nBiden's administration has tried to curb crossings by working with Mexico and other countries to reduce migrant flows through enforcement and economic policies, but many voters appear to think he took his eye off the ball.\n\nThe US president's announcement is due just a day after he spoke with Claudia Sheinbaum, who was elected Mexico's first woman president, to offer his congratulations and pledge a \"strong and collaborative partnership.\"", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@arab.news",

People with knowledge of the plans said they expected the cap to be set at an average of 2,500 to 3,000 daily crossings.\n\nIllegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have averaged more than 3,500 in recent weeks, according to the latest government data, so Biden's order could have immediate effects.\n\nA group of migrants rests after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border through the Rio Grande in El Paso, Texas, last month. Justin Hamel/Bloomberg\n\nDuring the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. authorities used a public health emergency to rapidly \"expel\" migrants and turn away asylum seekers who arrived illegally. Officials said Biden's expected order will operate similarly, while agents at the border will continue to face limitations, including a lack of detention space, transportation capacity and asylum officers.\n\nThe failed border legislation would have provided billions in additional funds for deportation capacity and asylum processing, but Republican lawmakers spurned the bill after former president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump came out against it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden last May implemented measures to penalize the asylum claims of migrants who cross into the United States illegally, but many are released into the United States because border authorities lack the capacity to detain and screen them.\n\n\"The big question for me is whether this will come with additional resources,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. \"Without additional dollars to implement this, the same challenges will remain that each of the past asylum restrictions have faced.\"\n\nBrownsville Mayor John Cowen, shown with President Biden during a visit to the southern border in February in Brownsville, Texas, is headed to Washington on Tuesday, when Biden is expected to announce his latest plan to curtail the number of migrants allowed to seek asylum in the U.S. Evan Vucci/Associated Press\n\nMigrants who state a fear of persecution if returned to Mexico will remain eligible under the Convention against Torture and other protections afforded by U.S. law, according to officials with knowledge of Biden's order.\n\nMexico also places limits on the number of returns it accepts, and it's unclear whether Biden will announce an increased willingness by Mexican authorities to take back migrants from all over the world in significant numbers.\n\nThe president has been in a political bind over the border, as the issue has become increasingly important for voters. The surge of migration during his term, which has ebbed and flowed but often surpassed record levels, remains one of his largest political liabilities, according to strategists.\n\nTrump has continuously attacked him for what he has described as \"open border\" policies and \"Biden migrant crime,\" pledging to enact a sweeping crackdown if he wins the presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our borders will be closed very soon,\" Trump said Friday, in remarks during which he railed against immigration and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business documents in the New York hush money trial against him.\n\nTrump made a similar attempt to cut off migrants' access to U.S. asylum protections, but the measures were blocked in federal court in 2019. Biden's order is expected to be challenged on similar grounds.\n\n\"We will need to review the executive order before making litigation decisions, but any policy that effectively shuts off asylum would raise obvious legal problems, just as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who was lead counsel on many challenges to Trump's policies, in an interview Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities have tallied about 2 million illegal crossings per year along the southern border since 2021, the highest levels ever, and migrants have been arriving in record numbers from China, India, Venezuela and dozens of other countries. Often guided to the U.S. border by criminal organizations in Mexico, the migrants typically surrender to U.S. border agents and express a fear of persecution if returned - the first step in seeking U.S. asylum.\n\nBiden's order would block them if crossings exceed the daily threshold. Mexican authorities were long opposed to the return of non-Mexicans by U.S. authorities, but the two countries have significantly increased their cooperation on immigration enforcement in recent years.\n\nCurrent agreements allow the U.S. to send up to 30,000 non-Mexicans back across the border each month, but Mexico has generally sought to limit returns to Central Americans and other Spanish-speaking migrants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMexican voters elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the country's first female leader, by a landslide margin Sunday in a vote that was widely viewed as a referendum on current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Sheinbaum, who will be inaugurated Oct. 1, has vowed to continue L\u00f3pez Obrador's cooperation with the United States on migration.\n\nWhile Biden has increasingly adopted the kind of language embraced by Trump on immigration - including pledging this year to \"shut down\" the border if it becomes overwhelmed by unauthorized crossings - he has struggled to find a message that can satisfy the diverse coalition of voters he is courting.\n\nSeveral progressive lawmakers have criticized Biden for his increasingly tough stance on the border, and pro-immigration activists have accused him of betraying core American ideals to adopt more humane immigration policies after Trump's turbulent term.\n\n\"The decision by this administration to criminalize migrants - many of whom are fleeing harm - is deeply disturbing and misguided,\" Sarah M. Rich, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement.\n\n\"Prosecuting people seeking safety in the U.S. for these immigration violations will lead to more Black and Brown people being incarcerated at the expense of immigrant families and communities, \" Rich said.\n\nWhite House officials said Biden will continue to explore various policy options to address the migration challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" said Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesman, in a statement.\n\nThe expected executive order is a signal that the plan of some Democrats to hammer Republicans over the failure of the bipartisan border deal opposed by Trump this year is unlikely to shield them from a barrage of attacks over the issue.\n\nWhen the bill failed the first time in the Senate, Biden pledged to take the message across the country and blame Trump for encouraging lawmakers to kill the agreement.\n\nWhile Biden initially pushed that message in campaign speeches, his focus in recent months has shifted toward figuring out how much he can accomplish without Congress.\n\nWhite House officials have long said Biden cannot unilaterally provide the resources necessary to secure the border, calling on Congress to pass funding and statutory changes that would create a more orderly migration system.\n\nCopy the

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nThe order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden\u00b4s order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden\u00b4s order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden talks with the U.S. Border Patrol and local officials, as he looks over the southern border, Feb. 29, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas, along the Rio Grande. Biden's migration order aims to shut down asylum requests at US-Mexico border if illegal crossings average 2,500 per day. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden\u00b4s directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration\u00b4s goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it\u00b4s deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden\u00b4s order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden\u00b4s proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden\u00b4s order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00b4s CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate\u00b4s bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden\u00b4s order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The number of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico. Still, immigration remains a top concern heading into the U.S. presidential election in November and Republicans are eager to hammer Biden on the issue.\n\nThe Democratic administration's effort would aim to head off any potential spike in crossings that could occur later in the year, as the fall election draws closer, when the weather cools and numbers tend to rise, two of the people. They were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing discussions and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe move would allow Biden, whose administration has taken smaller steps in recent weeks to discourage migration and speed up asylum processing, to say he has done all he can do to control the border numbers without help from Congress.\n\nThe talks were still fluid and the people stressed that no final decisions had been made.\n\nThe restrictions being considered are an aggressive attempt to ease the nation's overwhelmed asylum system, along with a new effort to speed up the cases of migrants already in America and another meant to quicken processing for migrants with criminal records or those who would otherwise be eventually deemed ineligible for asylum in the United States.\n\nThe people told the AP that the administration was weighing some of the policies directly from a stalled bipartisan Senate border deal, including capping the number of encounters at an average of 4,000 per day over a week and whether that limit would include asylum-seekers coming to the border with appointments through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. Right now, there are roughly 1,450 such appointments per day.\n\nTwo of the people said one option is that migrants who arrive after the border reaches a certain threshold could be removed automatically in a process similar to deportation and would not be able to return easily. Migrants were able to more easily return to the border if they were expelled under the pandemic-era policy known as Title 42. Under that arrangement, Mexico agreed to take back some non-Mexican nationalities, including migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nMigrants, especially families, claiming asylum at the southern border are generally released into the U.S. to wait out their cases. But there are more than 2 million pending immigration court cases, and some people wait years for a court date while they live in limbo in the U.S.\n\nAnyone can ask for asylum regardless of whether they arrive illegally at the border, but U.S. officials are increasingly pushing migrants to make appointments, use a legal pathway that avoids the costly and dangerous journey, or stay where they are and apply through outposts in Colombia, Guatemala and Costa Rica.\n\nThe Biden administration has grown ever more conservative on border issues as the president faces ceaseless criticism from Republicans and there are large numbers of migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico who are not easily returned, especially as global displacement grows from war, climate change and more.\n\nThe immigration authority that the administration has been looking to use is outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It gives a president broad leeway to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it would be \"detrimental\" to the U.S. national interest.\n\nSenate Republicans last week again blocked a bill that would have enshrined some of the same efforts into law. The vote was meant to underscore GOP resistance to the proposal even as Republicans have clamored for more restrictions and argued that Biden has not done enough to stem the flow of migrants entering into the U.S.\n\nThe bipartisan bill had been negotiated for months and appeared, for a moment anyway, to be heading toward passage. It was even endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council and its president Brandon Judd, an avowed supporter of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But Trump, concerned about handing Democrats an election-year win, called on Republicans to tank it, and they did.\n\nWhite House officials did not confirm the expected executive order.\n\nWhite House spokesman Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez said the administration \"continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\n\"While congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" he said.\n\nCongress this year approved funding for a total of 41,500 detention beds and increased money for immigration enforcement and removal operations by $1.2 billion over what the White House had initially requested. That included $106 million in more funding for programs that monitor immigrants in the asylum system through phone apps and ankle bracelets, rather than through detention.\n\nThose increases, negotiated after the collapse of the bipartisan deal, could pave the way for the administration to ratchet up immigration enforcement.\n\nYet unlike legislative action that is binding, anything Biden does through executive action can be challenged in the courts, and will almost certainly be, so it not clear whether -- or if -- the clampdown on asylum would begin. The administration was weighing other actions too, including faster and tougher enforcement of the asylum process.\n\nThe administration has generally paired proposed crackdowns with an expansion of legal paths elsewhere and was also planning to do so in the future, but not at the same time the new restrictions were announced, the people said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed

Those seeking asylum would be held to a much more rigorous standard for establishing credible fear of returning to their home country, although certain groups - including trafficking victims and unaccompanied children - would be excluded from the ban.\n\n\"Individuals who do not manifest a fear will be immediately removable, and we anticipate that we will be removing those individuals in a matter of days, if not hours,\" one official said. \"The bottom line is that the standard will be significantly higher. And so we do anticipate that fewer individuals will be screened in as a result.\"\n\nThe move comes amid rising public concern over the number of migrants crossing into the US, with polls showing a majority of Americans dissatisfied with the president's handling of the border. The White House has been under immense pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to reduce the number of migrants arriving at the southern border.\n\nUnder the executive order, which Biden plans to sign alongside several border-town mayors on Tuesday afternoon, the administration would shut down asylum requests to the US-Mexico border once the number of daily encounters reaches 2,500 between legal ports of entry. The border would reopen once the number of crossings eases to 1,500. Court challenges are expected, but administration officials defended the legal basis of the order, telling reporters they are \"confident that the steps we are taking today are consistent with our obligations under international law\".\n\nThe order is not expected to hinder other border activity, such as trade or traffic.\n\nMany progressive and Hispanic lawmakers expressed alarm at the sweep of the order, the most aggressive border move taken by the administration so far. The Biden administration spent several months examining whether the president had the authority to \"shut down\" the border, as he told Univision in an April interview. Republicans have insisted Biden already has broad authority to act on the border, but has refused to do so out of deference to the progressives in his base.\n\nImmigration and border policy are at the heart of Republicans' 2024 campaign message, with Trump bashing Biden as \"weak\" and vowing to unleash the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history should he win re-election in November.\n\nThe order relies on the same legal framework adopted by Trump to restrict unlawful crossings in 2018, but was blocked by a federal court. At the time, Democrats assailed Trump's border policies as draconian and rooted in xenophobia. But the White House fiercely rejected comparisons between Biden's new order and the severe immigration policies enacted by Donald Trump when he was in office.\n\n\"The Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,\" one official told reporters. \"The actions that we are taking today will only apply during times of high encounters ... The action will not ban people based on their religion. It will not separate kids from their mothers.\"\n\nTrump's campaign quickly weighed in on news of the order, dismissing the policy as insufficient. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign press secretary, said in a statement: \"If Joe Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen, but he never will because he is controlled by radical left Democrats who seek to destroy America.\"\n\nThe action comes months after Senate Republicans, at Trump's behest, voted down a bipartisan border security deal. Trump, wary of handing Biden a political victory on his signature issue, had announced his opposition to the bill and encouraged Republicans to block its advancement.\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, last month held another vote on the border package, which included measures Republicans have been clamoring for, including a far-reaching clampdown on the number of migrants allowed to claim asylum. The measure failed, as expected, but Schumer hoped to underscore Republican resistance to the deal they helped negotiate.\n\nAdministration officials made clear on Tuesday that they do not view the new order as a replacement for congressional action, and they again called on Republicans to work with Democrats to improve the US immigration system. They blamed Trump for impeding the passage of the bipartisan border bill, accusing Republicans of prioritizing political gamesmanship over national security.\n\n\"That's not how we should run a country,\" an administration official said. \"An election year should not prohibit us from getting the people's work done.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Univision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/bd9d824f9f7c97e71a7cb2d6fe196478", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

People with knowledge of the plans said they expected the cap to be set at an average of 2,500 to 3,000 daily crossings.\n\n\" READ MORE: Five ways Philadelphia can support asylum-seekers\n\nIllegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have averaged more than 3,500 in recent weeks, according to the latest government data, so Biden's order could have immediate effects.\n\nDuring the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. authorities used a public health emergency to rapidly \"expel\" migrants and turn away asylum seekers who arrived illegally. Officials said Biden's expected order will operate similarly, while agents at the border will continue to face limitations, including a lack of detention space, transportation capacity and asylum officers.\n\nThe failed border legislation would have provided billions in additional funds for deportation capacity and asylum processing, but Republican lawmakers spurned the bill after former president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump came out against it.\n\nBiden last May implemented measures to penalize the asylum claims of migrants who cross into the United States illegally, but many are released into the United States because border authorities lack the capacity to detain and screen them.\n\n\"The big question for me is whether this will come with additional resources,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. \"Without additional dollars to implement this, the same challenges will remain that each of the past asylum restrictions have faced.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: The history of South Asian American immigration wouldn't be the same without the ports of Philadelphia\n\nMigrants who state a fear of persecution if returned to Mexico will remain eligible under the Convention against Torture and other protections afforded by U.S. law, according to officials with knowledge of Biden's order.\n\nMexico also places limits on the number of returns it accepts, and it's unclear whether Biden will announce an increased willingness by Mexican authorities to take back migrants from all over the world in significant numbers.\n\nThe president has been in a political bind over the border, as the issue has become increasingly important for voters. The surge of migration during his term, which has ebbed and flowed but often surpassed record levels, remains one of his largest political liabilities, according to strategists.\n\nTrump has continuously attacked him for what he has described as \"open border\" policies and \"Biden migrant crime,\" pledging to enact a sweeping crackdown if he wins the presidency.\n\n\"Our borders will be closed very soon,\" Trump said Friday, in remarks during which he railed against immigration and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business documents in the New York hush money trial against him.\n\nTrump made a similar attempt to cut off migrants' access to U.S. asylum protections, but the measures were blocked in federal court in 2019.

People with knowledge of the plans said they expected the cap to be set at an average of 2,500 to 3,000 daily crossings.\n\nIllegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have averaged more than 3,500 in recent weeks, according to the latest government data, so Biden's order could have immediate effects.\n\nDuring the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. authorities used a public health emergency to rapidly \"expel\" migrants and turn away asylum seekers who arrived illegally. Officials said Biden's expected order will operate similarly, while agents at the border will continue to face limitations, including a lack of detention space, transportation capacity and asylum officers.\n\nThe failed border legislation would have provided billions in additional funds for deportation capacity and asylum processing, but Republican lawmakers spurned the bill after former president and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump came out against it.\n\nBiden last May implemented measures to penalize the asylum claims of migrants who cross into the United States illegally, but many are released into the United States because border authorities lack the capacity to detain and screen them.\n\n\"The big question for me is whether this will come with additional resources,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. \"Without additional dollars to implement this, the same challenges will remain that each of the past asylum restrictions have faced.\"\n\nMigrants who state a fear of persecution if returned to Mexico will remain eligible under the Convention against Torture and other protections afforded by U.S. law, according to officials with knowledge of Biden's order.\n\nMexico also places limits on the number of returns it accepts, and it's unclear whether Biden will announce an increased willingness by Mexican authorities to take back migrants from all over the world in significant numbers.\n\nThe president has been in a political bind over the border, as the issue has become increasingly important for voters. The surge of migration during his term, which has ebbed and flowed but often surpassed record levels, remains one of his largest political liabilities, according to strategists.\n\nTrump has continuously attacked him for what he has described as \"open border\" policies and \"Biden migrant crime,\" pledging to enact a sweeping crackdown if he wins the presidency.\n\n\"Our borders will be closed very soon,\" Trump said Friday, in remarks during which he railed against immigration and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business documents in the New York hush money trial against him.\n\nTrump made a similar attempt to cut off migrants' access to U.S. asylum protections, but the measures were blocked in federal court in 2019. Biden's order is expected to be challenged on similar grounds.\n\n\"We will need to review the executive order before making litigation decisions, but any policy that effectively shuts off asylum would raise obvious legal problems, just as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who was lead counsel on many challenges to Trump's policies, in an interview Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities have tallied about 2 million illegal crossings per year along the southern border since 2021, the highest levels ever, and migrants have been arriving in record numbers from China, India, Venezuela and dozens of other countries.

The action applies to \"unscheduled\" apprehensions at the border, officials said.\n\n\"The suspension and limitation on entry and the rule will not apply to individuals who use a safe and orderly process, such as the CBP [Customs and Border Protection] One mobile application to enter the United States at a port of entry in an orderly manner,\" an official said.\n\nCBP doesn't provide real-time data on border crossings. However, there were 3,600 apprehensions along the southern border on Sunday alone -- well past the threshold Biden has set to shut down all asylum claims between ports of entry, according to a source familiar with the data. Border Patrol is seeing an average of 3,500 apprehensions per day in recent weeks, according to another source -- also past the new threshold.\n\nThe rule applies to and will \"immediately\" expel any individual encountered along the southern border if the provision of limiting asylum at the border has been triggered, according to officials.\n\nThe migrant's country of origin doesn't matter, officials said, and individuals will be removed to their country of origin in a matter of \"days, if not hours,\" under the new executive rule.\n\nSenate again fails to advance border security bill in election-year showdown vote\n\nAdministration officials said the measures would \"significantly speed up\" the current process for individuals who do not manifest a credible fear, which is the threshold for establishing an asylum claim in the United States.\n\n\"We have seen consistently over the last few years that when we have the ability to remove individuals quickly, it can significantly impact migratory flows by changing the calculus for intending migrants, especially if they know that they are going to be removed quickly and not be able to remain in the United States for many years through their immigration court process,\" an official said. \"They're going to be much less likely to pay the thousands of dollars that it's required to the smuggling networks that more or less control access to the routes leading up to our border.\"\n\nThere is, however, an exception for children who are crossing the border as unaccompanied minors, officials said.\n\nThe 2,500 number was picked because that's the number negotiated in the bipartisan border bill, officials said.\n\nOfficials said these steps will do what the border bill was intended to do: strengthen the immigration system.\n\n\"The president worked with [a] bipartisan group of senators to reach a historic border security agreement, an agreement that would have delivered significant policy changes, resources and personnel necessary to secure our border and make our country safer, and that would have made the asylum process fairer and more efficient while ensuring protection for the most vulnerable,\" an administration official said, placing the blame squarely on Congressional Republicans.\n\nEarlier this year, Senate Democrats and Republicans negotiated a bipartisan border bill that was effectively killed in the House at the behest of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The American people told us what they want,\" the official said. \"They want a secure border.\"\n\nOfficials also pushed back on the notion that the rule is similar to that of former President Trump's, which was broad and targeted people based on other factors such as their religion.\n\nAdministration officials said they made changes to the executive rule that they believe would hold up in court.\n\nThe Department of Justice will be prepared to defend any litigation should it arise.\n\n\"DOJ defends lawsuits, rules and actions on a regular basis, and we are prepared for litigation on this rule,\" the official said. \"I think we are accustomed to being litigated frequently from both sides of a political spectrum for just about any measure we take in this space.\"\n\nChad Wolf, a Republican and former acting secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration, said that, from his perspective, the executive action won't make a dent in the \"asylum abuse\" that is being carried out along the border.\n\n\"There are holes in this plan,\" Wolf told \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday morning. \"This plan does nothing to stop the asylum abuse, does nothing to stop the parole abuse that this administration has done, nothing to stop catch and release. I see a lot of different holes here. I don't think it's going to work. I think it is too little too late.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_for_Immigration_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Office for Immigration Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccompanied_minor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unaccompanied minor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic_Wimpout", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic Wimpout", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2024/06/bc5bc15af36647abf0c191218782f03c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

People with knowledge of the plans said they expected the cap to be set at a daily average of 2,500 illegal crossings. Standard asylum processing would resume when the number drops below 1,500 crossings, an official said.\n\nIllegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have averaged more than 3,500 in recent weeks, according to the latest government data, so Biden's order could have immediate effects.\n\nDuring the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. authorities used a public health emergency to rapidly \"expel\" migrants and turn away asylum seekers who arrived illegally. Officials said Biden's expected order will operate similarly, while agents at the border will continue to face limitations, including a lack of detention space, transportation capacity and asylum officers.\n\nThe failed border legislation would have provided billions in additional funds for deportation capacity and asylum processing, but Republican lawmakers spurned the bill after former president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, came out against it.\n\nBiden has already implemented measures to restrict asylum claims of migrants who cross into the United States illegally, but many continue to be released into the United States because border authorities lack the capacity to detain, screen or deport them. In other cases, migrants' home countries won't take them back or cooperate with U.S. authorities on deportations.\n\n\"The big question for me is whether this will come with additional resources,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. \"Without additional dollars to implement this, the same challenges will remain that each of the past asylum restrictions have faced.\"\n\nMigrants who state a fear of persecution if returned to Mexico will remain eligible under the Convention Against Torture and other protections afforded by U.S. law, according to officials with knowledge of Biden's order.\n\nMexico also places limits on the number of non-Mexican migrants it will accept from the United States.\n\nThe president has been in a political bind over the border, as the issue has become increasingly important for voters. The surge of migration during his term, which has ebbed and flowed but often surpassed record levels, remains one of his largest political liabilities, according to strategists.\n\nTrump has continuously attacked him for what he has described as \"open border\" policies and \"Biden migrant crime,\" pledging to enact a sweeping crackdown if he wins the presidency.\n\n\"Our borders will be closed very soon,\" Trump said Friday, in remarks during which he railed against immigration as well as his 34 felony convictions for falsifying business documents in the New York hush money trial against him.\n\nTrump made a similar attempt to cut off migrants' access to U.S. asylum protections, but the measures were blocked in federal court in 2019. Biden's order is expected to be challenged on similar grounds.\n\n\"We will need to review the executive order before making litigation decisions, but any policy that effectively shuts off asylum would raise obvious legal problems, just as it did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who was lead counsel on many challenges to Trump's policies, said in an interview Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities have tallied about 2 million illegal crossings per year along the southern border since 2021, the highest levels ever, and migrants have been arriving in record numbers from China, India, Venezuela and dozens of other countries. Often guided to the U.S. border by criminal organizations in Mexico, the migrants typically surrender to U.S. border agents and express a fear of persecution if returned - the first step in seeking U.S. asylum.\n\nBiden's order would render them ineligible for asylum protections if crossings exceed the daily threshold.\n\nCurrent agreements allow the United States to send up to 30,000 non-Mexicans back across the border each month, but Mexico has generally limited returns to Central Americans, Cubans and some Haitians.\n\nMexican voters elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the country's first female leader, by a landslide margin Sunday in a vote that was widely viewed as a referendum on current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Sheinbaum, who will be inaugurated Oct. 1, has vowed to continue L\u00f3pez Obrador's cooperation with the United States on migration.\n\nWhile Biden has increasingly adopted the kind of language embraced by Trump on immigration - including pledging this year to \"shut down\" the border if it becomes overwhelmed by unauthorized crossings - he has struggled to find a message that can satisfy the diverse coalition of voters he is courting.\n\nSeveral liberal lawmakers have criticized Biden for his increasingly tough stance on the border, and pro-immigration activists have accused him of betraying core American ideals and not adopting more humane immigration policies after Trump's turbulent term.\n\n\"The decision by this administration to criminalize migrants - many of whom are fleeing harm - is deeply disturbing and misguided,\" Sarah M. Rich, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement.\n\n\"Prosecuting people seeking safety in the U.S. for these immigration violations will lead to more Black and Brown people being incarcerated at the expense of immigrant families and communities,\" Rich said.\n\nWhite House officials said Biden will continue to explore various policy options to address the migration challenge.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nThe expected executive order is a signal that the plan of some Democrats to hammer Republicans over the failure of the bipartisan border deal opposed by Trump is unlikely to shield them from a barrage of attacks over the issue.\n\nWhen the bill failed the first time in the Senate, Biden pledged to take the message across the country and blame Trump for encouraging lawmakers to kill the agreement.\n\nWhile Biden initially pushed that message in campaign speeches, his focus in recent months has shifted toward figuring out how much he can accomplish without Congress.\n\nWhite House officials have long said Biden cannot unilaterally provide the resources necessary to secure the border, calling on Congress to pass funding and statutory changes that would create a more orderly migration system.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp",

Under the Biden administration, nearly 10 million non-U.S. citizens have been encountered attempting to enter the United States.\n\nThe White House has not yet publicly disclosed details of the order, but it is expected to resemble a Senate proposal that House Republicans came out against earlier this year that sets specific levels of immigrant crossings that would trigger a border shutdown.\n\nRepublicans have blamed Biden for the historically high levels of illegal immigration for rolling back Trump-era immigration policies after taking office. They've insisted Biden has the power to end the border crisis without Congress, while the Biden administration has insisted a legislative solution is needed.\n\nBiden said in April there's no guarantee he has the legal authority to shut down the border and therefore Congress should act.\n\nNow Biden's proposal would entail shutting down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters hits 2,500 at ports of entry, meaning it could take effect immediately. The border could reopen if the daily average over the course of a week declines to 1,500, according the Associated Press.\n\nThe order would affect adult immigrants who cross the border and seek asylum. The changes are expected to be in line with limitations that were floated earlier this year in a Senate package that ultimately failed to gain Republican support. In that proposal, senators had floated barring immigrants from seeking asylum at the border (not just ports of entry) if more than 8,500 people were arrested in a single day or an average of 5,000 per apprehended in a week.\n\nChildren are expected to be exempt from the restrictions, which could cause Mexican smuggling organizations to increasingly traffic them to the border, knowing that they will not be turned away.\n\nAny executive action could face lawsuits from groups that perceive it as an overreach of authority since Congress has the ability to determine immigration levels.\n\nBiden's action stands at odds with statements that he and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have made for the past three years. Both have maintained that \"only Congress can fix our broken immigration system,\" as Mayorkas stated on May 23.\n\nBiden visited Brownsville, Texas, in February to tour the border, the second time in his five decades as an elected official.\n\nAhead of the February visit, the White House said that \"Congress must act\" to address the border, distancing itself from any possibility of executive action.\n\nAfter the Senate failed again to pass a border security measure last month, the White House is now going it alone to address what has become the No. 1 issue among U.S. voters nationwide: immigration.\n\nAt no time in history during any White House administration has that many immigrants come to the border, even in two terms.\n\nRepublicans have accused the Biden administration numerous times in congressional hearings of failing to respond adequately to the unprecedented surge of immigrants over the past 40 months.\n\nOn Monday, the White House shot back at Republicans as being opposed to the Senate plan and executive action for political reasons.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system. If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history. Instead, they put partisan politics ahead of our country's national security,\" said a White House spokesperson.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEncounters, which include non-U.S. citizens who either enter the country illegally or are deemed inadmissible at a port of entry, have remained between 192,000 and 371,000 per month since March 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn the decade leading up to the Biden administration, encounters ranged from 40,000 to 80,000 per month.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_giaritelli@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Anna Giaritelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP23122563239105.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 2629, "textEnd": 2635}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The White House has been under immense pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to reduce the number of migrants arriving at the southern border.\n\nMany progressive and Hispanic lawmakers expressed alarm at the sweep of the order, the most aggressive border move taken by the administration so far.\n\nUnder the executive order, which Biden plans to sign alongside several border-town mayors, the administration would shut down asylum requests to the US-Mexico border once the number of daily encounters reaches 2,500 between legal ports of entry, according to the Associated Press. The border would reopen once the number of crossings eases to 1,500. That could mean the order takes effect immediately. Legal challenges are expected.\n\nThe order is not expected to hinder other border activity, such as trade or traffic.\n\nThe administration spent several months examining whether Biden had the authority to \"shut down\" the border, as he told Univision in an April interview. Republicans have insisted Biden already has broad authority to act on the border, but has refused to do so out of deference to the progressives in his base.\n\nImmigration and border policy are at the heart of Republicans' 2024 campaign message, with Trump bashing Biden as \"weak\" and vowing to unleash the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history should he win re-election in November.\n\nThe order reportedly relies on the same legal framework adopted by Trump to restrict unlawful crossings in 2018, but was blocked by a federal court. At the time, Democrats assailed Trump's border policies as draconian and rooted in xenophobia.\n\nThe action comes months after the failure of a bipartisan border security deal tied to a foreign aid package that collapsed after Trump announced his opposition, wary of handing Biden a political victory on his signature issue. Senate Republicans, at Trump's behest, voted down the proposal.\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, last month held another vote on the border package, which included measures Republicans have been clamoring for, including a far-reaching clampdown on the number of migrants allowed to claim asylum. The measure failed, as expected, but Schumer hoped to underscore Republican resistance to the deal they helped negotiate.\n\nRepublicans have already responded to the proposed action, accusing Biden of delaying action on the border.\n\n\"Joe Biden's latest border scam isn't fooling anyone - as migrant crossings hit record highs year after year on his watch, he refused to shut down the border,\" said Philip Letsou, spokesman for the National Republican senatorial committee. \"But now that he's up for re-election and trailing badly, Biden's changed his mind.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Univision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/bd9d824f9f7c97e71a7cb2d6fe196478", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Biden issued a proclamation announcing the change under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nSenior administration officials framed the order as a response to congressional inaction on immigration after a bipartisan framework in the Senate was blocked by Republicans for a second time.\n\nAdministration officials walked a tightrope announcing the order, a forceful but targeted shift on asylum rights, one that administration officials said is not comparable to the Trump administration's system-wide crackdowns.\n\n\"There are several differences between the actions that we are taking today and Trump-era policies. The Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a call Monday.\n\nBut the order, which comes during an election year when immigration is set to play a key role, is almost certain to face legal challenges, as well as criticism from some on the left who have argued it echoes Trump's moves against the asylum system.\n\nWhat the order does\n\nThe core of the new policy is the ability to refuse entry to most foreign nationals who cross the border without prior authorization.\n\nFor purposes of immigration law, a foreign national enters the United States when they are lawfully admitted by a U.S. official; the new policy will prevent border officials from admitting new asylum seekers while it is active.\n\nThe order, an interim final rule released by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland, will kick in when the seven-day average of daily encounters at the southwest border and the southern coastal borders exceeds 2,500.\n\nWhen it does so, U.S. border officials will stop implementing credible fear interviews for asylum claims and work to quickly expel foreign nationals who've crossed the border between ports of entry.\n\nMigrants who are expelled under the order will receive a minimum five-year bar on re-entry to the United States and potentially be criminally prosecuted.\n\nAccording to administration officials, Mexico will receive nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as its own nationals, in expedited deportations.\n\nIt's unclear whether the Biden administration will have enough resources to quickly expel or to detain migrants barred from asylum, raising the possibility that more migrants will be released to the interior with orders of deportation rather than asylum claims, limiting their ability to apply for work permits.\n\nOfficials said the Biden administration will enhance its capabilities to return nationals of other countries, including extracontinental migrants from places such as China.\n\n\"We have been working tirelessly both in the region and throughout the world to enhance to both restrict the routes into the hemisphere for extra-hemispheric migrants ... and we've also been working with governments all over the world to enhance our ability to repatriate individuals to countries that have historically been challenging,\" an administration official told reporters.\n\nThe asylum restrictions will have exceptions.\n\nFor instance, they will not apply to unaccompanied minors, and officials will still be able to conduct credible interviews with migrants who manifest a fear of returning to their country because of persecution or potential torture situations.\n\nAccording to administration officials, the new policy will adhere to U.S. international obligations on treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, though that assessment will almost inevitably be challenged in court.\n\nOfficials also said the asylum crackdown will be bolstered several enforcement measures targeting smuggling networks and organizations that profit from migration in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe measures include revoking U.S. visas for government officials from places including Nicaragua, as well as top corporate officials from companies that provide services like transportation to migrants.\n\nAnd officials said the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will work in tandem to more quickly resolve the immigration cases of recent arrivals, looking to quickly expel or deport people without a valid asylum claim.\n\nOrder will go into effect immediately\n\nSenior administration officials said the measure would take effect on Tuesday because the seven-day average of daily encounters at the border is more than 2,500, despite the fact that illegal crossings have been on the decline in recent months.\n\nOne official said the 2,500 number was determined based on similar numbers negotiated by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate as part of a border security deal that failed to pass the chamber.\n\n\"The goal here is to secure our border while preserving our values as a nation,\" one official said.\n\nWhile the measure would be lifted once the seven-day average of daily encounters drops below 1,500, that threshold could prove difficult to meet. The last time the average of daily encounters was below 1,500 was in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhite House seeks to blame Republicans\n\nThe timing of the order comes in the heart of an election year, where polling has consistently shown voters trust former President Trump -- the likely GOP nominee -- more than Biden on the issue of immigration and border security.\n\nSenior administration officials on Tuesday did not explicitly tie the timing of the order to the election, but they argued the measure was a result of congressional Republicans' inaction.\n\n\"If Congress refuses to act, and if congressional Republicans refuse to act, the president is prepared to do so,\" one official told reporters.\n\nThe president and White House officials previously said it was up to Congress to enact changes at the border and suggested Biden's hands were tied on the issues.\n\nThe president and his team lobbied hard for a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would have provided funding for thousands of additional Border Patrol agents, investments in technology to catch fentanyl and target drug traffickers and the addition of asylum officers and immigration officers who could help relieve the backlog of asylum cases.\n\nBut Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of that bill twice.\n\nTrump had urged Republicans to oppose the legislation, suggesting it could give Biden an election year win.\n\n\"For 3 years, America's border security has been devastated by congressional Republican opposition to the law enforcement resources that President Biden has sought,\" deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates wrote in a memo shared with reporters.\n\n\"For 3 years, Joe Biden has led on border security and congressional Republicans have obstructed it -- all in the name of politics,\" Bates added.\n\nRepublicans have chastised Biden for waiting to take executive action on the border and argued Tuesday's measure is too little, too late.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(File/John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Tuesday that will allow him to partly suspend asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border when daily unauthorized crossings reach a threshold of 2,500 migrants.\n\n\"We do expect the authority would be in effect immediately,\" a senior administration official said on a Tuesday call with reporters previewing the executive order. It would not be permanent and only applies to the southern border, including the southwest land border and southern coastal borders.\n\nThe White House has been dealing with the largest number of migrant encounters at the southern border on record. Crossings from the southern border reached an all-time high in December, when U.S. Border Patrol agents had nearly 250,000 encounters, an increase of about 26,000 from the previous record set in May 2022. In addition, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made it a top issue for voters.\n\nBiden's move marks his most drastic crackdown on immigration during his administration.\n\nThe order makes three changes to asylum law under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act when that threshold of 2,500 migrants is reached, a senior administration official said. The first is that a noncitizen who crosses the border without authorization will be ineligible for asylum.\n\nThe second is any noncitizen who crosses the border while the order is in effect and is processed for removal will only be referred to a credible fear interview with an asylum officer \"if they manifest or express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, a fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nAnd the third is raising the standard for credible fear interviews to a \"reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard,\" which is \"a new, substantially higher standard than is currently being applied at the border,\" a senior administration official said.\n\n\"Taken together, these measures will significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawfully or without authorization and allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe order, versions of which were reported ahead of the White House announcement, drew criticism from both parties.\n\nRepublicans like U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana called it a \"weak executive order,\" while progressive Democrats slammed it as a partial ban on asylum.\n\nA senior administration official argued that the executive order is different from the Trump administration's immigration policies because the order will \"only apply during times of high encounters.\"\n\nBiden, who campaigned in 2020 on protecting asylum law, is relying on the same presidential authority -- Section 212(f) of the Immigration Nationality Act -- that the Trump administration used to justify several immigration-related restrictions, such as the travel ban from predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe Biden order would also allow border officials to return certain individuals who cross the border without authorization back to Mexico - nationals from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela.\n\nThere will be exemptions for lawful permanent residents, unaccompanied minors, people with an \"acute medical emergency\" or an extreme threat to life or safety, and for victims of human trafficking, a senior administration official said.\n\nA senior administration official said this temporary order would go away when there are seven consecutive days when daily encounters are less than 1,500 migrants between ports of entry. Once that is established, the order expires in 14 calendar days.\n\nThe Biden administration has considered moving forward with the executive order after an immigration deal the White House and Senate brokered earlier this year fell apart after Trump came out against it. Republicans quickly fell in line. Among other things, that deal would have given Biden the authority to shut down any asylum requests once encounters reached 5,000 people in a week or 8,500 in a day.\n\nA senior administration official said the 2,500 threshold was chosen to be similar to the deal stuck in the Senate.\n\n\"To Joe Biden, the safety of American families should always come first,\" senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo.\n\n\"That's why today, the President is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. Because of President Biden's leadership, law enforcement will gain new capabilities that congressional Republicans cannot block.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's also reminiscent of a 2018 attempt by Trump, which faced harsh criticism and legal challenges.\n\nBiden faces immense pressure to address illegal migration, a key voter concern. Polls indicate increasing support for stricter border measures among Democrats.\n\nThe order allows border officials to deny asylum claims and swiftly turn away migrants if crossings exceed a set threshold.\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Advocates For 'Easier And Simplified' Legal Immigration Process Amid Migrant Influx\n\nWhy It Matters: Sunday reportedly saw over 3,500 migrant apprehensions at the border.\n\nImmigration is among the major issues concerning voters in the upcoming 2024 presidential election.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats both face criticism for not taking action. But when the GOP hindered additional border enforcement this year for Trump's sake, it marked a significant policy shift between the parties.\n\nFor example, in 2019 Biden ran on a platform that criticized then-President Trump's asylum policies. Biden asserted that asylum seekers should present their cases within the U.S.\n\nThis new order demonstrates a significant departure from that stance.\n\nETFs To Watch: according to Benzinga Pro data, there are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to follow as this news unfolds.

That's why today, the president is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nOfficials said the tough new curbs should take effect straight away, as the number of people crossing the border without proper documentation is already above the threshold. Asylum seekers would once again be allowed to enter the country once the numbers dropped to 1,500 a day. \"We do expect that the authority would be in effect immediately,\" a Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president and see Biden moving closer to Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue heavily dragging on Biden's reelection chances in November. Biden himself was due to speak at the White House at 2:00 pm, local time.\n\nTrump's campaign earlier dismissed the expected executive order as being \"for amnesty, not border security.\"\n\nMigrants entering the United States are normally allowed to claim asylum if they face harm or persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Yet many spend years waiting for their claims to be processed, with critics saying that many people cross purely for economic reasons and then game the system to remain in the United States.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that Biden was dealing with an immigration system that had been \"broken for decades.\" Jean-Pierre accused Republicans in Congress of \"partisan politics\" by failing to cooperate with Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nUnder Biden, border crossings have surged to record levels, rising to a peak of around 300,000 - 10,000 a day - in December. The numbers have fallen considerably in recent months, to some 179,000 in April, but polls show it is still one of Biden's biggest electoral liabilities.\n\nBiden's executive order aims to defuse Republican attacks and to woo middle-of-the-road voters worried about the state of the border. But his plan will anger leftist Democrats and it will almost certainly be challenged in court by civil rights groups.\n\nThe White House moved to defuse criticisms that Biden is effectively copying Trump - even using the same laws as his predecessor for his new executive order. \"All of these policies are in stark contrast to how the previous administration managed immigration,\" a second senior administration official told reporters. \"They demonized immigrants, instituted mass raids, separated families at the border and put kids in cages.

While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far.\"\n\nThe decision shows how the politics of immigration have tilted sharply to the right over the course of Mr Biden's presidency. Polls suggest growing support, even inside the president's party, for border measures that Democrats once denounced and Mr Trump championed.\n\nThe order would allow border officials to prevent migrants from claiming asylum and rapidly turn them away once border crossings exceed a certain threshold.\n\nGovernment officials this year discussed allowing Mr Biden to shut down the border if there were an average of 5000 border crossings in a week, or 8500 in a single day, but those involved in the negotiations cautioned that the threshold was not finalised and could change.\n\nWhite House officials have been focused on a trigger that would empower Mr Biden to shut down the border.\n\nOn Sunday, border agents made more than 3500 apprehensions of migrants crossing the border without authorisation, according to a person with knowledge of the data. The numbers on Sunday were in line with recent trends of crossings at the southern border.\n\nThe restrictions will likely not apply to minors who cross the border alone, according to an official briefed on the order.\n\nThe executive action will likely mirror a measure in a failed bipartisan bill from this year that had some of the most significant border security restrictions Congress had contemplated in years. The bill would have provided billions in funding for the border, including the hiring of thousands of asylum officers to process claims.\n\nBut Republicans thwarted the bill in February, saying it was not strong enough. Many of them, egged on by Mr Trump, were loath to give Mr Biden a legislative victory in an election year.\n\nMr Biden's aides believe the executive order can provide Democrats another data point to cite when arguing to voters that they have sought solutions at the border while Republicans were more focused on using it as a political issue.\n\n\"While congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement on Monday.\n\nHe did not confirm the plans but said the administration was exploring \"a series of policy options, and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nIn a sign of just how much the politics on the issue have changed, Mr Biden, as a candidate in 2019, excoriated Mr Trump's policies during a debate.\n\n\"This is the first president in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country,\" Mr Biden said at the time. \"That's never happened before.\n\n\"You come to the United States, and you make your case,\" he added. \"That's how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.\"", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1765%2C$multiply_4%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/44efb11b2a697911c3637054803fdff57481a7a2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It would not be permanent and only applies to the southern border, including the southwest land border and southern coastal borders.\n\nThe White House has been dealing with the largest number of migrant encounters at the southern border in 20 years. In addition, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made it a top issue for voters. Biden's move marks his most drastic crackdown on immigration during his administration.\n\nThe order makes three changes to asylum law under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act when that threshold of 2,500 migrants is reached, a senior administration official said. The first is that a noncitizen who crosses the border without authorization will be ineligible for asylum.\n\nThe second is any noncitizen who crosses the border while the order is in effect and is processed for removal will only be referred to a credible fear interview with an asylum officer \"if they manifest or express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, a fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nAnd the third is raising the standard for credible fear interviews to a \"reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard,\" which is \"a new, substantially higher standard than is currently being applied at the border,\" a senior administration official said.\n\n\"Taken together, these measures will significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawfully or without authorization and allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe order, versions of which were reported ahead of the White House announcement, drew criticism from both parties.\n\nRepublicans like U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana called it a \"weak executive order,\" while progressive Democrats slammed it as a partial ban on asylum.\n\nBut U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, called the executive order \"a welcome action\" that will help an overwhelmed Border Patrol and provide relief for border communities burdened by \"our broken immigration system.\"\n\nKelly also chided congressional Republicans for being unwilling to do anything legislatively to address the nation's immigration problems.\n\n\"The Senate has twice had the opportunity to take up an agreement negotiated by Republicans and Democrats to invest in more Border Patrol agents, technology and personnel to stop fentanyl, officers to quickly screen asylum claims, and other lasting solutions, but both times my Republican colleagues walked away,\" he said in a written statement.\n\nA senior administration official argued that the executive order is different from the Trump administration's immigration policies because the order will \"only apply during times of high encounters.\"\n\nBiden, who campaigned in 2020 on protecting asylum law, is relying on the same presidential authority -- Section 212(f) of the Immigration Nationality Act -- that the Trump administration used to justify several immigration-related restrictions, such as the travel ban from predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe Biden order would also allow border officials to return certain individuals who cross the border without authorization back to Mexico - nationals from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela.\n\nThere will be exemptions for lawful permanent residents, unaccompanied minors, people with an \"acute medical emergency\" or an extreme threat to life or safety, and for victims of human trafficking, a senior administration official said.\n\nA senior administration official said this temporary order would go away when there are seven consecutive days when daily encounters are less than 1,500 migrants between ports of entry. Once that is established, the order expires in 14 calendar days.\n\nThe Biden administration has considered moving forward with the executive order after an immigration deal the White House and Senate brokered earlier this year fell apart after Trump came out against it. Republicans quickly fell in line. Among other things, that deal would have given Biden the authority to shut down any asylum requests once encounters reached 5,000 people in a week or 8,500 in a day.\n\nA senior administration official said the 2,500 threshold was chosen to be similar to the deal stuck in the Senate.\n\n\"To Joe Biden, the safety of American families should always come first,\" senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo.\n\n\"That's why today, the President is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. Because of President Biden's leadership, law enforcement will gain new capabilities that congressional Republicans cannot block.\"", "source": {"uri": "tucsonsentinel.com", "dataType": "news",

The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest.

Trump to cut off migration that was blocked in federal court.\n\nThe restrictions kick in once the seven-day average for daily crossings hits 2,500. Daily totals already exceed that number, which means that Mr. Biden's executive order could go into effect right away, allowing border officers to return migrants across the border into Mexico or to their home countries within hours or days.\n\nThe border would reopen to asylum seekers only when the number of crossings falls significantly. The figure would have to stay below a daily average of 1,500 for seven days in a row.

It's also reminiscent of a 2018 attempt by Trump, which faced harsh criticism and legal challenges.\n\nBiden faces immense pressure to address illegal migration, a key voter concern. Polls indicate increasing support for stricter border measures among Democrats.\n\nThe order allows border officials to deny asylum claims and swiftly turn away migrants if crossings exceed a set threshold.\n\nWhy It Matters: Sunday reportedly saw over 3,500 migrant apprehensions at the border.\n\nImmigration is among the major issues concerning voters in the upcoming 2024 presidential election.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats both face criticism for not taking action. But when the GOP hindered additional border enforcement this year for Trump's sake, it marked a significant policy shift between the parties.\n\nFor example, in 2019 Biden ran on a platform that criticized then-President Trump's asylum policies. Biden asserted that asylum seekers should present their cases within the U.S.\n\nThis new order demonstrates a significant departure from that stance.\n\nETFs To Watch: according to Benzinga Pro data, there are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to follow as this news unfolds.

Biden had previously hinted that he would take executive actions of this nature after a bipartisan agreement to restrict immigration in exchange for aid to Ukraine and Israel failed to pass the Senate after Republicans came out against it in response to Trump's opposition.\n\nIt will take effect if more than 2,500 migrants cross in a single day - a number which has become commonplace in recent months - meaning that the order could be instituted immediately. The order will be suspended if crossings drop below 1,500 people.\n\nDuring periods of suspension, anyone who crosses into the US without authorization would not be permitted to claim asylum \"absent exceptionally compelling circumstances\", according to senior administration official.\n\nExemptions would apply to \"children, victims of a severe form of trafficking, those experiencing an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life and safety,\" as well as \"other non-citizens who have a valid visa or some other lawful permission to enter the United States,' according to a Biden administration official.\n\nThe decision has met with backlash from progressive Democrats and immigration advocates, with some drawing similarities between Biden's border rule and what former president Donald Trump attempted to do while in office.\n\nCalifornia Senator Alex Padilla, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told The Independent that Biden's actions appeared to be \"paralleling some of what the Trump administration tried to do unsuccessfully\".\n\nIllinois Democrat Rep. Chuy Garcia, also told The Independent on Monday that he was concerned that the asylum restrictions could be \"eroding one of the things that sets us apart from every other country.\"\n\nFreshman Texas Democrat Representative Greg Casar noted that an \"enforcement-only approach\" would not help Biden politically because it would not solve the root causes of the record migration flows.\n\nHe also warned that the president is falling into what he described as a \"trap\" set by Republicans, and said that the way to make the border safe and take on cartels was to create legal pathways for migration and strengthen the asylum system.\n\nA Biden administration official, who asked for anonymity to brief reporters candidly, pushed back on the suggestion that Biden's immigration policy is comparable to Trump's border policies.\n\nThe Biden administration also pointed to efforts to expand lawful pathways into the US and a program where asylum seekers can use a Customs and Border Protection smartphone app to facilitate appointments at legal ports of entry.\n\nThe administration has also worked to establish processing centers abroad at which potential asylum seekers can begin the process rather than make their way to Mexico and cross illegally before presenting themselves to border agents.\n\nThe border action has been anticipated for months after Republicans voted against a bipartisan border bill earlier this year at the behest of presumptive Republican nominee Trump, who publicly said that passing the legislation would hand Democrats a win and help Biden in his re-election bid.\n\n\"The President worked with a bipartisan group of senators to reach a historic border security agreement, an agreement that would have delivered significant policy changes resources and personnel necessary to secure our border and make our country safer,\" a White House official said on Tuesday.\n\n\"[R]ational Republicans had an opportunity to support the fairest and toughest set of reforms in decades and they chose to put partisan political interests ahead of fixing our immigration system and securing our borders.\"\n\nRepublicans have criticized Biden's immigration policy as too lax and said it triggered an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border. They have frequently traveled to the US-Mexico border to criticize Biden and earlier this year, House Republicans impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, though the motion was tabled in the Senate.\n\nPolling shows that most voters see immigration as a serious issue.

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by the Associated Press on Monday.\n\nPresident Biden talks with U.S. Border Patrol agents and local officials at the southern border in February in Brownsville, Texas, along the Rio Grande. Biden's migration order aims to shut down asylum requests at US-Mexico border if illegal crossings average 2,500 per day. Evan Vucci/Associated Press\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Biden expected to announce new asylum restrictions at border\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Under the Biden administration, nearly 10 million non-U.S. citizens have been encountered attempting to enter the United States.\n\nThe White House has not yet publicly disclosed details of the order, but it is expected to resemble a Senate proposal that House Republicans came out against earlier this year that sets specific levels of immigrant crossings that would trigger a border shutdown.\n\nRepublicans have blamed Biden for the historically high levels of illegal immigration for rolling back Trump-era immigration policies after taking office. They've insisted Biden has the power to end the border crisis without Congress, while the Biden administration has insisted a legislative solution is needed.\n\nBiden said in April there's no guarantee he has the legal authority to shut down the border and therefore Congress should act.\n\nNow Biden's proposal would entail shutting down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters hits 2,500 at ports of entry, meaning it could take effect immediately. The border could reopen if the daily average over the course of a week declines to 1,500, according the Associated Press.\n\nThe order would affect adult immigrants who cross the border and seek asylum. The changes are expected to be in line with limitations that were floated earlier this year in a Senate package that ultimately failed to gain Republican support. In that proposal, senators had floated barring immigrants from seeking asylum at the border (not just ports of entry) if more than 8,500 people were arrested in a single day or an average of 5,000 per apprehended in a week.\n\nChildren are expected to be exempt from the restrictions, which could cause Mexican smuggling organizations to increasingly traffic them to the border, knowing that they will not be turned away.\n\nAny executive action could face lawsuits from groups that perceive it as an overreach of authority since Congress has the ability to determine immigration levels.\n\nBiden's action stands at odds with statements that he and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have made for the past three years. Both have maintained that \"only Congress can fix our broken immigration system,\" as Mayorkas stated on May 23.\n\nBiden visited Brownsville, Texas, in February to tour the border, the second time in his five decades as an elected official.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nAhead of the February visit, the White House said that \"Congress must act\" to address the border, distancing itself from any possibility of executive action.\n\nAfter the Senate failed again to pass a border security measure last month, the White House is now going it alone to address what has become the No. 1 issue among U.S. voters nationwide: immigration.\n\nAt no time in history during any White House administration has that many immigrants come to the border, even in two terms.\n\nRepublicans have accused the Biden administration numerous times in congressional hearings of failing to respond adequately to the unprecedented surge of immigrants over the past 40 months.\n\nOn Monday, the White House shot back at Republicans as being opposed to the Senate plan and executive action for political reasons.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system. If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history. Instead, they put partisan politics ahead of our country's national security,\" said a White House spokesperson.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEncounters, which include non-U.S. citizens who either enter the country illegally or are deemed inadmissible at a port of entry, have remained between 192,000 and 371,000 per month since March 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nIn the decade leading up to the Biden administration, encounters ranged from 40,000 to 80,000 per month.\n\nHaisten Willis contributed to this report.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

That requirement would rely on a 1952 law known as 212(f) that would allow the president to \"suspend the entry\" of foreigners if their arrival is \"detrimental to the interests \" of the country.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump used that authority to enforce a so-called \"travel ban\" into the US from Muslim countries during his administration.\n\nAsylum processing for those following the legal guidelines of entry into the US will still be conducted at centers at official border crossings where immigration officials are handling about 1,500 cases per day. Unaccompanied children are expected to be exempt from the new rules.\n\nThe latest numbers from federal officials show that nearly 6.5 million migrants have been stopped from crossing the border illegally during Biden's three and a half years in office, which is a record high for illegal immigration.\n\nThe problem has become a major presidential campaign issue for Biden, as he has been criticized by Republicans and Trump -- his presumed opponent in the November general election -- for being soft on immigration policies, even though migrant arrivals have dropped significantly this year.\n\nThe US Border Patrol recorded 118,000 migrant apprehensions at the southern border in May, the third consecutive monthly drop, with 129,000 border detentions taking place in March and 137,000 in April. Those monthly numbers are less than half of the record-high 302,000 migrant encounters that took place in December 2023.\n\nPolitical experts believe the new proposal will likely be challenged in court from either immigration advocates or from Republican-led states, even though a bipartisan border security deal failed earlier this year as a result of opposition from Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigrational personnel need to secure our border,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nA Gallup poll at the end of April showed that 27% of Americans view immigration as the most important issue facing the country, topping the economy and inflation.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Order 13769"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gallup, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/06/03/thumbs_b_c_9563380155feb2ebb8adc7c85d58dfcb.jpg?v=224915", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The rule states these rapid expulsion measures would remain in effect until 14 calendar days after there has been a seven-day average of fewer than 1,500 encounters between the ports of entry at the U.S. border.\n\n\"Since his first day in office, President Biden has called on Congress to secure our border and address our broken immigration system. Over the past three years, while Congress has failed to act, the President has acted to secure our border,\" the White House said Tuesday.\n\nThe decision to unveil these new border crossing and asylum restrictions comes after Biden attempted to attach new border and immigration funding to a broader supplemental spending bill to provide military aid to Ukraine and Israel and to expand security alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. The border security component of this bill collapsed as Republicans demanded more specific policy changes, in addition to funding for more immigration personnel and equipment. During the legislative standoff, many Republicans argued Biden could take immediate executive action, without Congress, to curb historically high border encounters under his administration.\n\nWhile the Tuesday White House statement blamed Congress for inaction on border security, Congressional Republicans criticized Biden for finally taking the executive actions they insisted he could months earlier.\n\n\"126 days ago, Joe Biden stated, 'I've done all I can do' to fix the border catastrophe. Today, he'll announce an executive action using the same authority he denied having,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said ahead of the Tuesday announcement. \"If he was actually concerned about our wide-open border, he would have acted a long time ago.\"\n\nJohnson went on to say the new border actions are unlikely to dramatically change the situation.\n\n\"It took [Biden] 1,231 days to start using executive authority to combat the southern border crisis,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said Tuesday. \"But his order would still allow more than 900,000 people to cross the border every year.

President Joe Biden is expected to announce steps Tuesday to close the Mexican border to asylum seekers when numbers surge, in a bid to tackle a key weak spot in his election battle with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, is set to sign a long-awaited executive order that would allow officials at certain times to deport migrants who cross the border illegally without processing their asylum claims first, US media reported.\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president, and see him moving further towards Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue drags on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nAn announcement is expected on Tuesday, sources close to the matter said, although the White House would not confirm reports that Biden will sign the executive order alongside mayors from border towns.\n\n\"What I can say is we are constantly and continuously looking at all options to try and really deal with the immigration system, a system that's been broken for decades,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nJean-Pierre blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to cooperate with Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"They decided to pick partisan politics,\" she said.\n\nBiden's curbs on asylum requests would kick in when illegal crossings hit 2,500 a day, and would not lift until numbers drop back to 1,500, several US media outlets reported.\n\nThe plans could anger some Democrats as they are the toughest by his party for years, and would rely on the use of the same law that Trump's administration used to ban immigration from some Muslim countries.\n\nThey would also almost certainly be challenged in court.\n\nRepublicans have sought to make the border a key issue ahead of the November 5 vote, portraying Biden as soft on stopping what Trump calls an \"invasion\" of migration.\n\nMore than 2.4 million migrants crossed the southern US border in 2023 alone, largely from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\nTrump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and raised the possibility of mass repatriations by the US military and detention camps.\n\nTrump and his allies have also accused Biden of operating an open border policy to boost Democratic voter numbers -- an allegation that Democrats decry as a racist conspiracy theory.\n\nBiden's administration has tried to curb crossings by working with Mexico and other countries to reduce migrant flows through enforcement and economic policies, but many voters appear to think he took his eye off the ball.\n\nThe US president's announcement is due just a day after he spoke with Claudia Sheinbaum, who was elected Mexico's first woman president, to offer his congratulations and pledge a \"strong and collaborative partnership\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_kemp@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Danny

That's why today, the president is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nOfficials said the tough new curbs should take effect straightaway as the numbers of people crossing the border without proper documentation are already above the threshold.\n\nAsylum seekers would again be allowed to enter once the numbers dropped to 1,500 a day.\n\n\"We do expect that the authority would be in effect immediately,\" a Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nBiden himself was due to speak at the White House at 2:00 pm (1800 GMT).\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president and see Biden moving closer to Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue heavily dragging on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nTrump's campaign earlier dismissed the expected executive order as being \"for amnesty, not border security.\"\n\nThe statement repeated Trump's frequent claims that illegal migrants are responsible for surges in violent crime -- an allegation not supported by any major police or academic data.\n\nMigrants entering the United States are normally allowed to claim asylum if they face harm or persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\n\nBut many spend years waiting for their claims to be processed, with critics saying that many people cross purely for economic reasons and then game the system to remain in the United States.\n\n'Kids in cages'\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that Biden was dealing with an immigration system that had been \"broken for decades.\"\n\nJean-Pierre accused Republicans in Congress of \"partisan politics\" by failing to cooperate with Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nUnder Biden, border crossings have surged to record levels, rising to a peak of around 300,000 -- 10,000 a day -- in December.\n\nMost are from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change, but growing numbers are also coming from other parts of the world to Latin America before making the treacherous trip north to the United States.\n\nThe numbers have fallen considerably in recent months, to some 179,000 in April, but polls show it is still one of Biden's biggest electoral liabilities.\n\nBiden's executive order aims to defuse Republican attacks and to woo middle-of-the-road voters worried about the state of the border.\n\nBut his plan will anger leftist Democrats and it will almost certainly be challenged in court by civil rights groups.\n\nThe White House moved to defuse criticisms that Biden is effectively copying Trump -- even using the same laws as his predecessor for his new executive order.\n\n\"All of these policies are in stark contrast to how the previous administration managed immigration,\" a second senior administration official told reporters.\n\n\"They demonized immigrants, instituted mass raids, separated families at the border and put kids in cages. Their policies went against our values as a nation.\"\n\nTrump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and says he would enact the biggest deportation of migrants in history as soon as he

US-Mexico border", "body": "Order will allow US to shut off asylum requests and deny entry to migrants once daily threshold is met, US media reports.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order this week that would place new restrictions on the ability of asylum seekers to seek protection at the United States-Mexico border, drawing criticism from rights advocates.\n\nCiting unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter, US news outlets reported on Monday that the order will allow the Biden administration to shut off asylum requests and automatically deny entry to migrants once a daily threshold is met.\n\nBiden is expected to make the announcement on Tuesday.\n\nThe move comes as the Democratic leader continues what experts have dubbed a rightward lurch on immigration amid political pressure from Republicans in the lead-up to November's presidential election.\n\nBiden is set to face off in the race against his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, who pursued a hardline, anti-immigration stance while in the White House.\n\n\"From day one, the administration has always evaluated what actions could be taken,\" a White House official told the AFP news agency, without confirming the reports.\n\n\"There haven't been any final decisions regarding what additional executive actions, if any, could be taken,\" the official added.\n\nCiting three people briefed on the plan, CBS News reported on Monday that Biden's executive order will allow US officials to immediately turn back asylum seekers who enter the country without permits once daily crossings hit a certain number.\n\nIt is unclear what that threshold will be, but CNN and ABC News said the order would be applied each day that 2,500 unauthorised border crossings are registered.\n\nUS officials are currently making just under 4,000 apprehensions at the border daily, CNN reported, citing an official with the US Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe US media outlets also said Biden's order would rely on Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a presidential authority used by Trump to enact some of his most contentious immigration policies.\n\nThat includes the so-called \"Muslim ban\", which saw the Trump administration bar entry into the US to citizens of several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have slammed Biden on immigration since the Democratic president came into office in early 2021, blaming him for a surge in arrivals last year.\n\nWhile Biden has enacted border restrictions of his own and the number of unauthorised crossings has dropped in recent months, the Republican Party continues to zero in on the issue ahead of what is expected to be a tight November election.\n\nAsked in an interview with FOX News about Biden's expected executive order, Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, said, \"It's too little, too late.\"\n\nMeanwhile, members of Biden's own Democratic Party, as well as human rights groups, have condemned the administration for enacting more restrictions at the border.\n\n\"We are alarmed that the administration seems to be reacting to political pressures rather than implementing solutions that address the real challenges at the border,\" Mark Hetfield, CEO and president of migration and refugee rights group HIAS, said in a statement last month.\n\n\"The further degradation of protections and due process in the asylum system will undoubtedly lead to the US government returning individuals to territories where they face violence and harm.\"\n\nThe Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, an Arizona-based legal aid non-profit, also said on social media last week that the executive order would have dire consequences.\n\n\"An expulsion power like this will bar people fleeing grave harm from even asking for asylum in the US, force them to wait in dangerous conditions, and exacerbate many of the current challenges we're facing at the border,\" the group said.\n\n\"People arriving at the border have the right to begin the asylum process -- regardless of where they're from, how they arrived, or how many people have arrived before them.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score":

In May, about 3,800 people were encountered per day, according to data obtained by CBS News. The asylum claim process would only be allowed to resume if the number of daily encounters drops below 1,500.\n\nThe U.S. asylum system is heavily backlogged, with over 1.1 million asylum cases currently pending approval in immigration courts. The average asylum seeker waits around four years before receiving a hearing in immigration court, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a nonprofit research group at Syracuse University. While cases are pending, asylum seekers live in limbo, with limited rights to employment and public benefits. The number of asylum cases pending has grown seven-fold since 2012, according to TRAC.\n\nRead More: 'We Are the World Power.' How Joe Biden Leads\n\nThe Biden Administration says that the executive order will help reduce the backlog and make the system more efficient. \"President Biden believes we must secure our border. That is why today, he announced executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. These actions will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the Southern Border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today,\" a senior Administration official said in a statement. The order contains humanitarian exceptions for unaccompanied children and victims of trafficking.\n\nImmigration is a top priority for voters, according to a recent poll by Pew Research Center. The executive order comes as Biden struggles in the polls against Donald Trump, whose hardline views on immigration can resonate with the American public. A poll conducted in January 2024 by CNN showed that nearly half of Americans would support the detainment and deportation of millions of immigrants.\n\nThe Biden Administration also blamed Republicans for blocking a congressional border control bill -- which also included funding for Israel and Ukraine -- that would have provided funding for an additional 1,500 new Customs and Border Protection personnel, 1,200 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, fentanyl detection machines to be used at the border, and made it easier to remove migrants believed to pose a threat to public safety.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump called the bill a \"gift to the radical left Democrats,\" and the bill failed to pass the Senate.\"Legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security and immigration reform,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a memo addressing Tuesday's executive order. \"Today we are again calling on congressional Republicans to stop choosing Donald Trump and fentanyl traffickers over the Border Patrol Union and the safety of their constituents.\"\n\nBiden was set to announce his plans in Washington D.C. and invited the mayors of two border towns, John Cowen of Brownsville, Texas and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg, Texas, to attend the event.\n\nThe number of crossings at the U.S. southern border has decreased since December as Mexican authorities have increased their enforcement efforts.\n\nOn Sunday, Mexico elected a new President, Claudia Sheinbaum. She comes from the same political party as Mexico's current president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who was cooperative with the U.S. on border policy.", "source": {"uri": "time.com",

The action applies to \"unscheduled\" apprehensions at the border, officials said.\n\n\"The suspension and limitation on entry and the rule will not apply to individuals who use a safe and orderly process, such as the CBP [Customs and Border Protection] One mobile application to enter the United States at a port of entry in an orderly manner,\" an official said.\n\nThe rule would apply to and expel \"immediately\" any individual who is encountered along the southern border if the provision of limiting asylum at the border has been triggered, according to officials.\n\nThe migrant's country of origin doesn't matter, officials said, and individuals would be removed to their country of origin in a matter of \"days, if not hours,\" under the new executive rule.\n\nSenate again fails to advance border security bill in election-year showdown vote\n\nAdministration officials said the measures would \"significantly speed up\" the current process for individuals who do not manifest a credible fear, which is the threshold for establishing an asylum claim in the United States.\n\n\"We have seen consistently over the last few years that when we have the ability to remove individuals quickly, it can significantly impact migratory flows by changing the calculus for intending migrants, especially if they know that they are going to be removed quickly and not be able to remain in the United States for many years through their immigration court process,\" an official said. \"They're going to be much less likely to pay the thousands of dollars that it's required to the smuggling networks that more or less control access to the routes leading up to our border.\"\n\nThere is, however, an exception for children who are crossing the border as unaccompanied minors, officials said.\n\nThe 2,500 number was picked because that's the number negotiated in the bipartisan border bill, officials said.\n\nOfficials said these steps will do what the border bill was intended to do: strengthen the immigration system.\n\nBiden challenges Trump to drop opposition to bipartisan border security bill\n\n\"The president worked with [a] bipartisan group of senators to reach a historic border security agreement, an agreement that would have delivered significant policy changes, resources and personnel necessary to secure our border and make our country safer, and that would have made the asylum process fairer and more efficient while ensuring protection for the most vulnerable,\" an administration official said, placing the blame squarely on Congressional Republicans.\n\nEarlier this year, Senate Democrats and Republicans negotiated a bipartisan border bill that was effectively killed in the House at the behest of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The American people told us what they want,\" the official said. \"They want a secure border.\"\n\nOfficials also pushed back on the notion that the rule is similar to that of former President Trump's, which was broad and targeted people based on other factors such as their religion.\n\nUnaccompanied minors are representing themselves in immigration court, alarming advocates\n\nAdministration officials said they have made changes to the executive rule that they believe would hold up in court.\n\nThe Department of Justice will be prepared to defend any litigation should it arise.\n\n\"DOJ defends lawsuits, rules and actions on a regular basis, and we are prepared for litigation on this rule,\" the official said. \"I think we are accustomed to being litigated frequently from both sides of a political spectrum for just about any measure we take in this space.\"\n\nChad Wolf, a Republican and former acting secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration, said that, from his perspective, the executive action won't make a dent in the \"asylum abuse\" that is being carried out along the border.\n\n\"There are holes in this plan,\" Wolf told \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday morning. \"This plan does nothing to stop the asylum abuse, does nothing to stop the parole abuse that this administration has done, nothing to stop catch and release. I see a lot of different holes here. I don't think it's going to work.

The mayors of Brownsville and Edinburg in Texas, and San Diego, California, are among those invited, local officials confirmed to Scripps News.\n\nHowever, the event has also faced criticism from some local officials, who argue more action is needed to curb illegal immigration.\n\nLatin America and Caribbean\n\nMexico elects Claudia Sheinbaum as its first woman president\n\nAP via Scripps News\n\n5:25 AM, Jun 03, 2024\n\n\"This is nothing but a sham and an insult to those of us dealing with the real consequences of his failed border policies. San Diego is the epicenter of illegal immigration. Yesterday alone, we faced over 1,300 encounters,\" El Cajon, California, Mayor Bill Wells posted on X.\n\nAs recently as last week, the White House said it was looking at \"all available options\" to address the situation at the border.\n\n\"The President is going to do everything that he can to deal with what [we've] been seeing: a broken immigration system,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling on Air Force One on May 29. \"We're always going to look at all of our options.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the Biden administration has made incremental border rule changes, including moving public safety evaluations for migrants seeking asylum to earlier in the approval process, and expanding eligibility for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act for DACA recipients. The administration was previously considering raising the standard for asylum claims and expanding lawful entry through parole programs.\n\nThe anticipated policy announcement follows a failed renewed effort in Congress to pass a bipartisan negotiated border deal. A Senate vote failed late last month on the measure after it repeatedly faced Republican opposition. The bill would have increased funding for resources and given President Biden authority to shut down the border after encounters met a certain threshold, something the president touted as the \"toughest\" reforms in years. President Biden spoke with leaders of both chambers ahead of the vote to urge its passage, though such efforts failed to sway the opposition.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans are choosing to stand in the way of border enforcement, I will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need. If you believe, as I do, that we need reform now, doing nothing is not an option,\" President Biden said in a statement following the failed vote. \"We must make our border more secure and we must make sure the United States remains a beacon of hope and opportunity. Today and every day, I remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nPresident Biden has faced pressure from both Republicans and Democrats to take action on the border. More than a dozen House Democrats sent a letter to President Biden last month urging executive action on the border. Meanwhile, Republicans continue to call for more stringent measures.\n\nTension over the border reached an apex late last year as the number of encounters with migrants surpassed a record-breaking 300,000 in December, CBP data showed, though monthly encounters have since fallen substantially. Still, critics have warned the number could creep back up again absent new actions.\n\nLast week, a White House official maintained there hadn't been final decisions made on what additional executive actions, if any, could be taken.\n\nIn a statement to Scripps News, the White House defended President Biden's stance on the border, suggesting congressional Republicans had failed to act by blocking the president's legislative proposals.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" a White House spokesperson stated. \"As we have said before, the Administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\n48 Hours on the Border\n\nA day on a ranch along the US-Mexico border\n\nScripps News Phoenix\n\n1:01 PM, Mar 20, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden's planned actions are anticipated to be met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration advocates, and their ability to withstand legal scrutiny remains unclear.\n\nIn 2018, a similar policy implemented by then-President Trump restricting asylum opportunities drew an immediate lawsuit from a coalition of migrant support groups, who argued the actions violated Congress' \"clear command that manner of entry cannot constitute a categorical asylum bar.\"\n\nYears later, while litigation over the Trump policy was ongoing, President Biden replaced it with a similar version, which itself drew court challenges. In July 2023, a federal judge ruled against the government, finding that the policy \"is both substantively and procedurally invalid.\" President Biden opted to appeal the case and defend the restrictions, angering immigration advocates and progressive Democrats in Congress.\n\nAlready, some immigration advocates have expressed anger with President Biden as rumors of the executive actions spread.\n\n\"Adding new operational requirements to border processing when the numbers are low will generate confusion that benefits smugglers and drives up crossings,\" said Andrea Flores, vice president for immigration policy & campaigns with the advocacy group FWD. \"If the administration wants to show progress on border security, they should be helping the public understand why border numbers have dropped, not send the message that the border isn't secure and needs yet another ineffective asylum restriction.\"\n\nThe border has become a key issue in the 2024 election, particularly for Republicans. In a recent Economist/YouGov poll, a majority of respondents considered immigration to be an important issue, while more Republicans than Democrats considered it their most important concern. Trump has frequently attacked President Biden over border policy, promising mass deportations if he is elected. In an interview with Time, Trump said he'd use local law enforcement and the National Guard.

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nThe order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated

The rule also raises the legal bar for an asylum claim at the border from reasonable possibility they will face torture at home to reasonable probability it will happen.\n\nThe heightened restrictions would end two weeks after the number of crossers stopped at the border dips below 1,500 for more than a week. Data shows that for most of the last nine years, border stops have not fallen below 1,500 per day.\n\n\"These measures will significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawfully\" and will \"allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States,\" said one of several senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\nRead more: Biden administration wants to speed up deportation for some migrants. How will it work?\n\nThe restrictions would not apply to those who enter at official ports of entry or use other legal means, including those who use a relatively new mobile app to request an appointment. It would also exempt certain groups, including unaccompanied children, victims of severe forms of trafficking and people with dire medical emergencies or extreme threats to life and safety.\n\nAdministration officials defended their efforts to secure the border, saying they have already returned more migrants in the past 12 months than in any year since 2010. They also sought to blame Republicans for Congress' failure to pass a bipartisan bill that would have given the administration more money and authority to control the border.\n\nOfficials conceded the president's executive action, which is likely to face legal challenges, is essentially a stopgap.\n\n\"There is no lasting solution to the challenges we are facing without Congress doing its job,\" one official said.\n\nWhile Mexico has agreed to take migrants from several Latin American countries, the administration is facing an increase in arrivals from other continents, including Asia. Officials said they were working to strengthen deals to fly people to India, China and other countries of origin, but said it remains a challenge.\n\nOfficials have faced a barrage from critics on the right, who blame Biden for what they call an out-of-control border, and on the left, who accuse him of replicating xenophobic policies advanced by former President Trump. Officials took pains to differentiate their policies from Trump's most well-known practices, including the attempts to ban the entry of people from Muslim-majority countries and to separate children from their families.\n\nRead more: Biden, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador discuss migration in latest call\n\n\"We will not separate children from their families,\" said one official. \"It is not only inhumane, it's grossly ineffective.\"\n\nSeeking asylum, regardless of how someone arrives on U.S. soil, is a right under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act and international law. That issue proved problematic for the Trump administration's efforts to limit border crossings, and it could trip up Biden's latest order as well.\n\nAmy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA, said the expected executive action \"plays into false narratives about the invasions at the border and advances a policy grounded in white supremacist ideas at the expense of people in search of safety in the U.S.\"\n\n\"President Biden's action sets a dangerous international precedent as a first-of-its-kind numerical cap on asylum, limiting the number of people who can claim asylum in the U.S. and effectively shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border, using the same legal authority that the Trump administration used to implement the dangerous and xenophobic Muslim and African travel bans,\" Fischer said.\n\nImmigration has been one of Biden's thorniest problems, practically and politically. He campaigned in large part on reversing Trump's most hard-line policies and rhetoric, but after Biden assumed office, border crossings and arrests rose dramatically.\n\nPolls show many voters rate immigration and the border as a top issue, often alongside the economy, character, democracy and abortion. It's also the area where they are most likely to rate Trump ahead of Biden, according to an ABC News poll released last month showing 47% of Americans trust Trump more on the issue, compared with 30% who trust Biden more.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki",

The Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a call Monday.\n\nBut the order, which comes during an election year when immigration is set to play a key role, is almost certain to face legal challenges, as well as criticism from some on the left who have argued it echoes Trump's moves against the asylum system.\n\nWhat the order does\n\nThe core of the new policy is the ability to refuse entry to most foreign nationals who cross the border without prior authorization.\n\nFor purposes of immigration law, a foreign national enters the United States when they are lawfully admitted by a U.S. official; the new policy will prevent border officials from admitting new asylum seekers while it is active.\n\nThe order, an interim final rule released by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland, will kick in when the seven-day average of daily encounters at the southwest border and the southern coastal borders exceeds 2,500.\n\nWhen it does so, U.S. border officials will stop implementing credible fear interviews for asylum claims and work to quickly expel foreign nationals who've crossed the border between ports of entry.\n\nMigrants who are expelled under the order will receive a minimum five-year bar on re-entry to the United States and potentially be criminally prosecuted.\n\nAccording to administration officials, Mexico will receive nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as its own nationals, in expedited deportations.\n\nIt's unclear whether the Biden administration will have enough resources to quickly expel or to detain migrants barred from asylum, raising the possibility that more migrants will be released to the interior with orders of deportation rather than asylum claims, limiting their ability to apply for work permits.\n\nOfficials said the Biden administration will enhance its capabilities to return nationals of other countries, including extracontinental migrants from places such as China.\n\n\"We have been working tirelessly both in the region and throughout the world to enhance to both restrict the routes into the hemisphere for extra-hemispheric migrants ... and we've also been working with governments all over the world to enhance our ability to repatriate individuals to countries that have historically been challenging,\" an administration official told reporters.\n\nThe asylum restrictions will have exceptions.\n\nFor instance, they will not apply to unaccompanied minors, and officials will still be able to conduct credible interviews with migrants who manifest a fear of returning to their country because of persecution or potential torture situations.\n\nAccording to administration officials, the new policy will adhere to U.S. international obligations on treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, though that assessment will almost inevitably be challenged in court.\n\nOfficials also said the asylum crackdown will be bolstered several enforcement measures targeting smuggling networks and organizations that profit from migration in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe measures include revoking U.S. visas for government officials from places including Nicaragua, as well as top corporate officials from companies that provide services like transportation to migrants.\n\nAnd officials said the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will work in tandem to more quickly resolve the immigration cases of recent arrivals, looking to quickly expel or deport people without a valid asylum claim.\n\nOrder will go into effect immediately\n\nSenior administration officials said the measure would take effect on Tuesday because the seven-day average of daily encounters at the border is more than 2,500, despite the fact that illegal crossings have been on the decline in recent months.\n\nOne official said the 2,500 number was determined based on similar numbers negotiated by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate as part of a border security deal that failed to pass the chamber.\n\n\"The goal here is to secure our border while preserving our values as a nation,\" one official said.\n\nWhile the measure would be lifted once the seven-day average of daily encounters drops below 1,500, that threshold could prove difficult to meet. The last time the average of daily encounters was below 1,500 was in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhite House seeks to blame Republicans\n\nThe timing of the order comes in the heart of an election year, where polling has consistently shown voters trust former President Trump -- the likely GOP nominee -- more than Biden on the issue of immigration and border security.\n\nSenior administration officials on Tuesday did not explicitly tie the timing of the order to the election, but they argued the measure was a result of congressional Republicans' inaction.\n\n\"If Congress refuses to act, and if congressional Republicans refuse to act, the president is prepared to do so,\" one official told reporters.\n\nThe president and White House officials previously said it was up to Congress to enact changes at the border and suggested Biden's hands were tied on the issues.\n\nThe president and his team lobbied hard for a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would have provided funding for thousands of additional Border Patrol agents, investments in technology to catch fentanyl and target drug traffickers and the addition of asylum officers and immigration officers who could help relieve the backlog of asylum cases.\n\nBut Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of that bill twice.\n\nTrump had urged Republicans to oppose the legislation, suggesting it could give Biden an election year win.\n\n\"For 3 years, America's border security has been devastated by congressional Republican opposition to the law enforcement resources that President Biden has sought,\" deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates wrote in a memo shared with reporters.\n\n\"For 3 years, Joe Biden has led on border security and congressional Republicans have obstructed it -- all in the name of politics,\" Bates added.\n\nRepublicans have chastised Biden for waiting to take executive action on the border and argued Tuesday's measure is too little, too late.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rafael_bernal@thehill.com", "name": "Rafael Bernal", "type":

Biden's migration order aims to shut down asylum requests at US-Mexico border if illegal crossings average 2,500 per day. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled plans to enact immediate significant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border as the White House tries to neutralize immigration as a political liability ahead of the November elections. The White House detailed the long-anticipated presidential proclamation signed by Biden, which would bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed. The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. The order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday. Once this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution. Meanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Biden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase. Yet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented. For instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive. Senior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations. The legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\"\u009d to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive. The senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum. For instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies. The directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year. Average daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Congressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\"\u009d meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election. \"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\"\u009d Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\" ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType":

And the number of gotaways continue to elude even top immigration officials.\n\nCustoms and border Protection have apprehended more than 7.8 million migrants at the southern border since President Joe Biden took office\n\nBiden's White House repeatedly claimed Congress needed to be the entity to stunt the record-breaking flow of illegal immigration at the southern border. But now the Democratic president is planning to announce an executive order as soon as Tuesday.\n\nThe action would represent the most restrictive border policies put forward by Biden and is reminiscent of former President Donald Trump's policies to block migration at the southern border - actions that were challenged in federal courts by Democrats.\n\nRead More What is in Biden's 'crackdown' on migrants\n\nRep. Johnson (R-La.) on Sunday wouldn't give Biden any kudos for acting on immigration after three-and-a-half years of deflection and implementing policies counteractive to limiting migration.\n\nWhen asked if Biden deserves credit for finally acting, the Speaker said: 'I don't ... it's too little too late now.'\n\n'He's trying to desperately show the American people that he wants to address the issue that he himself created,' Johnson told Fox News Sunday. 'We documented 64 specific actions that President Biden and Secretary [Alejandro Mayorkas] at [the Department of Homeland Security] took over ... the course of three and a half years, beginning on the first day that President Biden [took office], to open the border.'\n\n'They did it intentionally; it's had catastrophic effects upon our country that we'll be living with for decades to come,' he continued.\n\nSeveral officials familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that Biden plans to enact in his executive order parts of the failed Senate border deal. This would include denying entrance to migrants at certain thresholds - like capping it when encounters reach 4,000 per day over the course of a week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to announce his most restrictive policies at the southern border through an executive order this week\n\nThe order could block illegal immigration at the southern border once apprehensions reach a certain threshold per day. Pictured: Members of the Texas National Guard installs border fencing with razor wire in El Paso on April 2\n\nThe authority the White House expects to use in the executive order comes from Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That law provides presidents leeway in blocking entry of certain immigrants if it would be 'detrimental' to national interests.\n\nTrump repeatedly leaned on that section of the law to shut-out certain groups of immigrants crossing into the U.S. illegally.\n\nPreviously the White House asked Congress to pass new laws to expand Biden's presidential authority over the border, but a bipartisan border deal failed to take off earlier this year.\n\nPresidents using section 212(f) to restrict migration does not require congressional approval. But Biden has repeatedly said he wants new laws from Congress to fix the border.\n\nIt appears the White House has decided that they can go it alone, as Republicans have charged, after the Senate deal failed twice.\n\nJohnson argued on Sunday that Biden is only taking initiative on the border issue because recent polling suggests immigration is of top concern for Americans.\n\n'Now he wants to issue some sort of executive order, I guess to show that, 'Oh he really does care about the issue.' The only reason he's doing that is because the polls say that it's the biggest issue in America,' Johnson told Fox News.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

Those trying to cross a border at that point will be deported to their home countries or sent back to Mexico unless they have prior authorization to present their asylum cases or fall under certain exceptions.\n\nThe policy, the officials said, responds to a lack of congressional action and a volume of migrants that the federal government cannot effectively manage. The new measures will \"significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawful or without authorization and allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe limit is not permanent, and it will be lifted two weeks after the Department of Homeland Security deems that the number of daily encounters drops to a more manageable level, set at an average of 1,500 or less for seven consecutive days.\n\nThe asylum limits will be in place for people who cross the border unlawfully. Migrants will be put in fast-tracked deportation proceedings but will be offered what is called a \"credible-fear interview,\" one of the first step in an asylum process, if they say they are afraid to return home or could face persecution or torture. Officials said that migrants claiming a \"reasonable probability of persecution or torture\" will be held to a higher standard fo entry into the U.S. than what is currently applied.\n\nThe 2,500 daily average limit does not affect those who book appointments to present their asylum case through the CBPOne app, a phone application migrants use to schedule appointments with immigration authorities at the border. Also not counting toward the daily 2,500 limit: lawful permanent residents, people with visas, unaccompanied minors, people facing a medical emergency or a threat to their life, and trafficking victims.\n\nThe Biden administration has faced unprecedented levels of migration. The announcement Tuesday comes amid an election year in which immigration is at the front and center of a fierce presidential race. Both immigration rights activists and Republicans have blasted Biden for his handling of immigration issues.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden officials criticized Republicans in Congress for not passing a bipartisan deal on the border and emphasized that the newly enacted measure would not allocate personnel and resources to the southwest border.\n\n\"President Biden believes we must secure our border,\" the White House said in a statement. \"That is why today, he announced executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum...But we must be clear: this cannot achieve the same results as Congressional action, and it does not provide the critical personnel and funding needed to further secure our Southern border.\"\n\nAdvocates who have criticized the Biden administration ahead of the announcement say the measure is at least partially politically-driven and will place migrants in danger and bar some with legitimate asylum claims from seeking refuge in the United States.\n\n\"It's deeply disappointing to see President Biden so hellbent on dismantling human rights for people seeking asylum and implementing policies that are plainly illegal under international and refugee law,\" said Amy Fischer, Director of Refugee and Migrant Rights at Amnesty International USA.\n\nOfficials said the number of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border has decreased but the volume still remains high. That's particularly true regarding immigration from Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti, which is on pace to match or surpass record numbers from previous years despite new legal pathways implemented by the Biden administration last year targeting those countries.\n\nA new parole program allowing nationals from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti and Nicaragua to enter and work in the United States for two years promised to stem the flow of migrants from those countries crossing the border. About 439,000 people from the four countries have arrived in the United States through the parole processes through April of this year, according to federal government data. But as the backlog of cases grows, leaving some applicants waiting for over a year, and the situation in their home countries further deteriorates, the number of border encounters rapidly increased again.\n\nThe number of Venezuelans and Haitians coming to the U.S. border in the fiscal year 2024, which started in October, is already over 2022 figures, according to April data published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Until April, 187,993 Venezuelans and 59,592 Haitians had been processed at the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nThe number of encounters with Cuban nationals has significantly increased this fiscal year after a drop following the announcement of the new parole program in January last year. From October through April, almost 100,000 Cubans have been processed at the border. If the trend continues, the yearly figure could surpass last year's, when 142,352 Cubans reached the border.\n\nOf the four nationalities in the parole program, only the number of Nicaraguan migrants reaching the U.S. border has notably decreased from an all-high of over 100,000 in fiscal year 2022 to about 30,000 in fiscal year 2024.\n\nBiden administration officials acknowledge the new rule will likely be challenged in court. Current immigration law states migrants can apply for asylum even if they enter the country unlawfully.\n\nThere are also questions about how immigration authorities can send back what is likely to be a large number of migrants without more resources and increased cooperation from third countries to accept more deportation flights. There are also worries about how the federal government would handle the influx of people coming from countries in other continents, such as China and Afghanistan.\n\nVenezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has stopped accepting deportation flights from the U.S. after the recent reimposition of some oil sanctions by the Biden administration. Deportation flights to Cuba resumed last year, and Cuban authorities said they would be willing to accept more. Despite the turmoil in Haiti, where gangs are threatening to take over the government, deportation flights resumed in April after a temporary pause amid the political instability.\n\nThe U.S. officials said they will continue deporting up to 30,000 Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians and Nicaraguans monthly to Mexico as part of a previously brokered deal with the neighboring country.", "source":

That threshold, administration officials said, has already been hit over the past week.\n\nThe announcement represents an aggressive attempt by Biden to bolster his standing on the border in advance of the November election. Biden is expected to use a speech on Tuesday to highlight his unilateral efforts to resolve the crisis, while congressional Republicans -- at the behest of Donald Trump -- killed efforts to pass bipartisan border legislation earlier this year.\n\nThe president will be joined later on Tuesday by members of Congress and local and state leaders from border cities and states, in an effort to project consensus and political strength on a topic that has long dogged him politically. It's expected to spur blowback from progressives and immigration advocates, who plan to speak out against the move Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"The goal here is to secure our border while preserving legal immigration consistent with our values as a nation,\" said a senior administration official, previewing the announcement for reporters. \"There are several differences between the actions that we are taking today and Trump-era policies. The Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system and did so in a shameful and inhumane way ... The actions that we are taking today will only apply during times of high encounters.\"\n\nThe new rule from the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice will restrict asylum during periods of high volumes of border crossings.\n\nWhen crossings exceed a daily average of 2,500 over the course of a week, the president will have the authority to shut down the border in between ports of entry. Once the shutdown is in effect, DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas can reopen the border once average crossings have fallen below 1,500 for seven consecutive days. That determination allows the border to reopen 14 days later.\n\nThere will still be a number of exceptions, including for unaccompanied children, some victims of trafficking, migrants facing acute medical emergencies or imminent threats to their safety. Migrants who also have an appointment at a port of entry via Custom and Border Protection's smartphone app will still be processed.

President Joe Biden is under increased pressure to do something to curb it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden plans to take action with a new executive order marking a significant policy change.\n\nThe executive order would temporarily shut down the southern border when illegal border crossings exceed a certain threshold. It would be the president's most aggressive, unilateral action on the border yet.\n\n\"The timing of it is very political,\" said Houston immigration attorney, Mana Yegani.\n\nYegani said the timing of it all is impossible to ignore just 24 days before the first presidential debate with Donald Trump.\n\n\"He wants to have ammunition in his hand to say I did do something about the border crisis,\" Yegani said.\n\nCBS News has learned Biden's order will shut off asylum access and immediately deport migrants at times when U.S. authorities are overwhelmed with illegal crossings.\n\n\"There's going to be a daily quota of how many people can come to the U.S. knock on the door and say I want to ask for asylum,\" Yegani said.\n\nThat cap appears to be a daily average of 2,500 illegal crossings. The border would temporarily shut down for asylum access between legal ports of entry until the average daily number of illegal crossings dips below 1,500.\n\nUnder those metrics, Biden's order could take effect immediately. Right now, illegal crossings are averaging more than 3,500 per day in recent weeks.\n\n\"It's yet to be seen how it will be implemented once the border will be shut down,\" Yegani said. \"How are they going to control the crowd once they shut down the border?\"\n\nThe election of a new president in Mexico will play a huge role in exactly how Biden's order is implemented. Adding to the uncertainty are lawsuits that will most certainly be filed days after Biden issues his order tomorrow.\n\n\"We could see a massive surge of people trying to come in before the federal court makes a final ruling on the executive order's facility,\" Yegani said.\n\nThe White House said it's doing this now because Republicans killed a bipartisan immigration deal earlier this year that would've done something similar.\n\nTo be clear, the policy would not impact regular operations at legal ports of entry along the southern border.", "source": {"uri": "khou.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHOU 11 Houston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/c633bde0-73dd-4460-9186-f1ce048b2749/20240604T032119/c633bde0-73dd-4460-9186-f1ce048b2749_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

That's why today, the president is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nOfficials said the tough new curbs should take effect straightaway as the numbers of people crossing the border without proper documentation are already above the threshold. Asylum seekers would again be allowed to enter once the numbers dropped to 1,500 a day.\n\n\"We do expect that the authority would be in effect immediately,\" a Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nBiden himself was due to speak at the White House at 2:00 pm (1800 GMT).\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president and see Biden moving closer to Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue heavily dragging on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nTrump's campaign earlier dismissed the expected executive order as being \"for amnesty, not border security.\"\n\nThe statement repeated Trump's frequent claims that illegal migrants are responsible for surges in violent crime -- an allegation not supported by any major police or academic data.\n\nMigrants entering the United States are normally allowed to claim asylum if they face harm or persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\n\nBut many spend years waiting for their claims to be processed, with critics saying that many people cross purely for economic reasons and then game the system to remain in the United States.\n\n- 'Kids in cages' - More from this section S.

But his plan will anger leftist Democrats and it will almost certainly be challenged in court by civil rights groups.\n\nThe White House moved to defuse criticisms that Biden is effectively copying Trump -- even using the same laws as his predecessor for his new executive order.\n\n\"All of these policies are in stark contrast to how the previous administration managed immigration,\" a second senior administration official told reporters.\n\n\"They demonized immigrants, instituted mass raids, separated families at the border and put kids in cages. Their policies went against our values as a nation.\"\n\nTrump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and says he would enact the biggest deportation of migrants in history as soon as he

It would not be permanent and only applies to the southern border, including the southwest land border and southern coastal borders.\n\nThe White House has been dealing with the largest number of migrant encounters at the southern border in 20 years. In addition, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made it a top issue for voters. Biden's move marks his most drastic crackdown on immigration during his administration.\n\nThe order makes three changes to asylum law under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act when that threshold of 2,500 migrants is reached, a senior administration official said. The first is that a noncitizen who crosses the border without authorization will be ineligible for asylum.\n\nThe second is any noncitizen who crosses the border while the order is in effect and is processed for removal will only be referred to a credible fear interview with an asylum officer \"if they manifest or express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, a fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nAnd the third is raising the standard for credible fear interviews to a \"reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard,\" which is \"a new, substantially higher standard than is currently being applied at the border,\" a senior administration official said.\n\n\"Taken together, these measures will significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawfully or without authorization and allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe order, versions of which were reported ahead of the White House announcement, drew criticism from both parties.\n\nRepublicans like U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana called it a \"weak executive order,\" while progressive Democrats slammed it as a partial ban on asylum.\n\nA senior administration official argued that the executive order is different from the Trump administration's immigration policies because the order will \"only apply during times of high encounters.\"\n\nBiden, who campaigned in 2020 on protecting asylum law, is relying on the same presidential authority -- Section 212(f) of the Immigration Nationality Act -- that the Trump administration used to justify several immigration-related restrictions, such as the travel ban from predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe Biden order would also allow border officials to return certain individuals who cross the border without authorization back to Mexico - nationals from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela.\n\nThere will be exemptions for lawful permanent residents, unaccompanied minors, people with an \"acute medical emergency\" or an extreme threat to life or safety, and for victims of human trafficking, a senior administration official said.\n\nA senior administration official said this temporary order would go away when there are seven consecutive days when daily encounters are less than 1,500 migrants between ports of entry. Once that is established, the order expires in 14 calendar days.\n\nThe Biden administration has considered moving forward with the executive order after an immigration deal the White House and Senate brokered earlier this year fell apart after Trump came out against it. Republicans quickly fell in line. Among other things, that deal would have given Biden the authority to shut down any asylum requests once encounters reached 5,000 people in a week or 8,500 in a day.\n\nA senior administration official said the 2,500 threshold was chosen to be similar to the deal stuck in the Senate.\n\n\"To Joe Biden, the safety of American families should always come first,\" senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo.\n\n\"That's why today, the President is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. Because of President Biden's leadership, law enforcement will gain new capabilities that congressional Republicans cannot block.\"", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news",

There haven't been any final decisions regarding what additional executive actions, if any, could be taken,\" the official told AFP.\n\nRecord numbers of border crossings during the Democrat's time in office have put huge pressure on Biden as he trails in most polls behind Republican former president Trump.\n\nRepublicans have sought to make the border a key issue ahead of the November 5 vote, portraying Biden as soft on stopping what Trump calls an \"invasion\" of migration.\n\nMore than 2.4 million migrants crossed the southern US border in 2023 alone, largely from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\nBiden's curbs would be some of the toughest brought in by any Democrat and would rely on the use of the same law that Trump's administration used to ban immigration from some Muslim countries.\n\nBut they would also almost certainly be challenged in court.\n\nThe White House blamed Republicans in Congress for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border, which Biden tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"The administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nTrump has meanwhile ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback despite a historic court verdict last week that made him the first former president to become a convicted felon.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and railed, without evidence, about migrants

About 1,500 asylum seekers go through the process at official crossings each day, mostly after setting up appointments using a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app known as CBP One.\n\nMayors of several border towns - including Brownsville and Edinburg, both in Texas - were expected to be in Washington for the president's announcement.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have also been reportedly briefed on the plan.\n\nThe proposal, however, is likely to be challenged in court, either from immigration advocates or from Republican-led states.\n\nA White House official told the BBC on Friday that no final decisions had been made on possible executive actions.\n\nIn a statement, a White House spokesperson noted that a bipartisan border security deal failed earlier this year as a result of opposition from Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigrational personnel need to secure our border,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nRepublicans criticised the Biden border plan as an election-year ruse and argued that US laws already exist to prevent illegal immigration, but they were not being duly enforced by the Democratic president.\n\nNews of the potential executive order comes as numbers of migrant detentions at the US-Mexico border fall.\n\nRecently released statistics from CBP show that about 179,000 migrant \"encounters\" were recorded in April.\n\nIn December, by comparison, the figure spiked to 302,000 - a historic high.\n\nOfficials in the US and Mexico have said that increased enforcement by Mexican authorities is largely responsible, although many experts have cautioned the reductions are unlikely to be permanent.\n\nThe decline in migrant crossings at the US border comes at a politically fraught time for President Biden.\n\nPolls show that immigration is a primary electoral concern for many voters in the presidential election in November.\n\nA Gallup poll at the end of April found that 27% of Americans view immigration as the most important issue facing the country, topping the economy and inflation.\n\nA separate poll conducted in March by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that two-thirds of Americans now disapprove of Mr Biden's handling of the border, including about 40% of Democrat voters.\n\nMigrant crossings plunge at US-Mexico border- why it may not last\n\nUS migrant crisis shifts from Texas to California border\n\nMigrant crossings

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nThe order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And, across the board, this coverage unanimously omitted one piece of major news.\n\nMost representative of this coverage was the CBS Evening News. Watch the full report, as aired on Monday, June 3rd, 2024 (click \"expand\" to view transcript):\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL: President Biden is under intense political pressure to curb illegal immigration. It's a top concern for voters, one that Donald Trump and his allies have seized on. And tomorrow Biden is expected to take action issuing a major executive order allowing him to partially shut down the asylum process at the southern border. CBS News was the first to break the story, and tonight our Nancy Cordes is at The White House. Nancy, good to see you. So I understand this is going to be the most restrictive border policy ever enacted by a Democratic president, why now?\n\nNANCY CORDES: Well, Norah, The White House had been hoping that Congress would take this step. It didn't. This represents a major change to immigration policy, and we're told that the president is going to sign this executive order tomorrow. CBS News has learned that this new order will allow U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants without processing their asylum claims any time the number of illegal border crossings tops a specific threshold, and sources tell CBS that threshold is likely to be 2500 migrant apprehensions a day. Which means this partial ban could be triggered on day one because the number of apprehensions at the southern border in May was higher than that. It was 3800 a day according to the Border Patrol. Right now, of course, asylum-seekers are allowed to stay in the U.S. until their case is processed, which can take years. And critics say that creates an incentive for those who don't qualify to come to the U.S. anyway. This new executive order is almost certainly going to face legal challenges down the road. The White House appears to be going this route now because Republicans rejected a bipartisan senate deal that would have done something similar. Norah.\n\nO'DONNELL: Nancy Cordes with that big news tonight. Thank you so much.\n\nYou have it all, really. CBS's report boils down to concerns over Biden's electoral prospects, and lamentations over the fact that Republicans didn't codify 4,999 illegal crossings into law- leaving Biden to use executive authority to try to fix the mess he made via executive authority when he ripped the border open on Day One.\n\nABC News followed a similar pattern:\n\nRACHEL SCOTT: Tonight, President Biden preparing to take his most aggressive action on immigration yet, with plans to issue an executive order to effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers when migrant crossings surge. Sources tell ABC News when daily encounters reach 2,500 between ports of entry, asylum seekers would be turned away. The move could have an immediate impact. Migrant crossings have averaged 3,500 a day in recent weeks. The president, keenly aware that immigration is a top issue for voters, has been weighing how he can act alone, after Donald Trump urged Republicans to block a bipartisan deal their own party negotiated.\n\nProtect the Precious at all times, in and out of season.\n\nNBC took a significantly different approach in that Telemundo anchor Julio Vaqueiro steered away from domestic political implications and covered the likely meltdown to come from the Immigration-Industrial Complex:\n\nLINDSAY TOCZYLOWSKI: This really what sounds like a draconian and potentially unlawful immigration shutdown of the border.\n\nVaqueiro closed out his coverage by exposing a major loophole in the executive order: The unaccompanied minors exception.\n\nVAQUEIRO: Today President Biden spoke with Mexico's president-elect. As for tomorrow's executive action, it's expected to include some exceptions,humanitarian exceptions including one for unaccompanied children.\n\nThat exception becomes increasingly relevant when taking notice of the related news item suppressed across the dial: the Biden administration's decision to kill 350,000 asylum cases- effectively, a mass amnesty.\n\nAs reported by the indispensable Jennie Taer over at The New York Post:\n\nWhile the Biden administration is attempting to look like it's getting tough on the border, behind the scenes it's operating a program of \"mass amnesty\" for migrants, The Post can reveal.\n\nData show that since 2022, more than 350,000 asylum cases filed by migrants have been closed by the US government if the applicants don't have a criminal record or are otherwise not deemed a threat to the country.\n\nThis means that while the migrants are not granted or denied asylum -- their cases are \"terminated without a decision on the merits of their asylum claim\" -- they are removed from the legal system and no longer required to check in with authorities.\n\nThe move allows them to legally, indefinitely roam the US without fear of deportation, effectively letting them slip through the cracks.\n\nThat's kind of a super important point to cover when reporting on matters pertaining to immigration and the border. But, as always, the Regime Media's focus is to Protect the Precious and to cast President Biden as the purest, truest victim of any of a wide assortment of (often self-induced) calamities.\n\nSORR OF UNRELATED NOTE BUT NOT REALLY: It was refreshing to watch folks actually SPEAKING ENGLISH on a network newscast (as did Telemundo anchor Julio Vaqueiro for NBC and TelevisaUnivision anchor Enrique Acevedo for CBS during their respective coverages of the election of Claudia Sheinbaum as the next president of Mexico), as opposed to the weird, verby Newspeak so prevalent today.\n\nClick \"expand\" to view the full transcripts of the aforementioned reports as aired on their respective newscasts on Monday, June 3rd, 2024:\n\nDAVID MUIR: Meanwhile, there is a developing headline tonight involving the U.S./Mexico border. This evening, sources now say President Biden is preparing to take tough executive action on immigration, including shutting the border when the number of asylum seekers reaches 2,500. It would trigger an immediate shutdown. It comes tonight as the new president of Mexico, their first woman president, a physicist and engineer, has already signaled she will work with the U.S. on immigration. Rachel Scott at the White House.\n\nRACHEL SCOTT: Tonight, President Biden preparing to take his most aggressive action on immigration yet, with plans to issue an executive order to effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers when migrant crossings surge.

And some have suggested I should just go ahead and try it.\n\nSCOTT: The U.S. has seen a record 6.4 million illegal border crossings during the Biden administration. Officials say the numbers have dipped in recent months, because Mexico is cracking down on their side of the border. And the U.S. will soon have a new partner. Mexico tonight electing its first woman and first Jewish president, Claudia Sheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City, a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering who won the Nobel Peace Prize. Sheinbaum is vowing to continue the policies of outgoing president Lopez Obrador working to control the flow of migrants. And David, and back to that executive order, this could have an immediate impact for those who are seeking asylum. The number of migrant encounters at the border already far exceeds that threshold. The White House and the Biden administration fully aware this will likely be challenged in court. David.\n\nMUIR: Rachel Scott with a developing headline from The White House tonight. Rachel, thank you.\n\nLESTER HOLT: Facing high numbers of migrant crossings at the border, NBC News has learned President Biden is expected to take executive action tomorrow, right on the heels of Mexico's historic presidential election. Telemundo's Julio Vaqueiro is in Mexico City.\n\nJULIO VAQUEIRO: Facing mounting pressure over his handling of the border, NBC News has learned that the Biden administration is expected to announce a sweeping executive action that would allow the president to temporarily shut down the border if the number of illegal crossings reaches 2,500 a day, according to three people familiar to the discussions. There are currently more than 4,000 illegal border crossings every day according to Homeland Security, suggesting a shutdown could go into effect immediately. This policy is a reversal from the president's stance in January.\n\nJOE BIDEN: I've done all I can do.\n\nVAQUEIRO: With the presidential election approaching, Mr. Trump routinely slams president Biden over his handling of the border.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: They're pouring through every state, every state is now a border state.\n\nVAQUEIRO: Now President Biden is trying to institute restrictions similar to those Mr. Trump tried to enact in 2018, which courts struck down.\n\nLINDSAY TOCZYLOWSKI: This really what sounds like a draconian and potentially unlawful immigration shutdown of the border.\n\nVAQUEIRO: This announcement, on the heels of history in Mexico.\n\nCLAUDIA SHEINBAUM: \u00a1Viva Mexico! [ Cheers ]\n\nVAQUEIRO: Claudia Sheinbaum won yesterday's presidential election, becoming the first woman and the first Jewish president in the country's 200-year history. The climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City will now be tasked with working with the U.S. to contain the flow of migrants at the border.\n\nANA MARIA SALAZAR SLACK: I'm sure we're not going to have any major announcements of changes or proposals until it's defined- find out who's the next President of the United States.\n\nVAQUEIRO: Today President Biden spoke with Mexico's president-elect. As for tomorrow's executive action, it's expected to include some exceptions,humanitarian exceptions including one for unaccompanied children.

The president is set to speak at 2 p.m. at the White House.\n\nThe partial ban on asylum claims will take effect almost immediately, officials said. Regular asylum processing will only be restored 14 days after the secretary of homeland security determines that the weekly average of daily illegal border crossings has dipped below 1,500. The proclamation could be activated again if the weekly average of daily crossings between ports of entry surpasses 2,500.\n\nTo the dismay of migrant advocates, the seismic policy change will attempt to upend U.S. asylum law, which allows migrants on American soil to request humanitarian protection, even if they cross the border illegally. But Biden administration officials have argued the asylum system is buckling under the weight of over 3 million pending applications, incentivizing migrants to come to the U.S. because it takes years to decide their cases.\n\nMr. Biden is signing a proclamation temporarily suspending the entry of most migrants at the southern border, while the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are publishing a regulation to implement his directive. The measures are set to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.\n\nMigrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border between legal entry points when the order is in effect will be barred from asylum and \"immediately removable\" to Mexico or their home countries, officials said. The administration, one official added, plans to carry out these deportations \"in a matter of days, if not hours.\"\n\nOnly migrants who affirmatively express fear of being persecuted or tortured will be screened by U.S. asylum officers, the officials said. But they will only be screened for lesser-forms of protection -- not asylum -- and will need to pass interviews with heightened standards to avoid being quickly deported.\n\nThe asylum crackdown will not apply to unaccompanied children, those with acute medical conditions or fleeing imminent harm and migrants who use legal pathways to enter the U.S., such as the system powered by the government smart phone app known as CBP One. The administration will continue to process roughly 1,500 migrants at ports of entry under the CBP One process.\n\nTo justify the policy shift, the administration is citing a 1950s law known as 212(f) that empowers the president to suspend the entry of foreigners when the executive branch determines that their arrival is \"detrimental\" to U.S. interests. That same law became infamous under the Trump administration, which invoked it to sharply restrict legal and illegal immigration, including travel from certain Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOfficials said the partial asylum ban will apply to so-called extra-continental migrants, such as those from China, who have been journeying to the U.S. border in record numbers in recent years. But they did say Mexico had agreed to take them back, raising the specter that some migrants will still be released with court notices since certain, including China, limit or reject U.S. deportations.\n\nMr. Biden's policy is modeled after one of the pillars of a bipartisan border security deal that failed twice in Congress due to widespread Republican opposition, giving administration officials an opportunity to argue they are acting unilaterally on one Americans' top concerns in the absence of congressional action.\n\nWhile sweeping in nature, the announcement will not completely \"close\" or \"shut down\" the southern border, as asylum processing and legal trade and travel will continue unimpeded at official ports of entry.\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Biden's drastic border pivot stems from the intense political pressure he has faced from Republicans and some Democrats on immigration, one of his worst-polling issues.\n\nBut it is also in response to the reality on the ground along the U.S.-Mexico border, where American officials have reported record levels of migrant apprehensions, including over 2 million in each of the past two years. This year, migrant apprehensions are down by more than 50% from the all-time highs recorded late last year, partially due to a months-long campaign by Mexico to stop migrants from reaching the U.S. border.\n\nOne administration official said Tuesday's announcement would \"strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate claims.\"\n\nAndrea Flores, a former Biden administration official, denounced the president's move, saying it could set a dangerous precedent.\n\n\"If the president is now claiming he can shut down asylum when he feels like it - even after border numbers have plunged by over 50% -- this precedent gives future presidents the pretext to suspend any immigration pathway to the United States,\"

The action applies to \"unscheduled\" apprehensions at the border, officials said.\n\n\"The suspension and limitation on entry and the rule will not apply to individuals who use a safe and orderly process, such as the CBP [Customs and Border Protection] One mobile application to enter the United States at a port of entry in an orderly manner,\" an official said.\n\nThe rule would apply to and expel \"immediately\" any individual who is encountered along the southern border if the provision of limiting asylum at the border has been triggered, according to officials.\n\nThe migrant's country of origin doesn't matter, officials said, and individuals would be removed to their country of origin in a matter of \"days, if not hours,\" under the new executive rule.\n\nAdministration officials said the measures would \"significantly speed up\" the current process for individuals who do not manifest a credible fear, which is the threshold for establishing an asylum claim in the United States.\n\n\"We have seen consistently over the last few years that when we have the ability to remove individuals quickly, it can significantly impact migratory flows by changing the calculus for intending migrants, especially if they know that they are going to be removed quickly and not be able to remain in the United States for many years through their immigration court process,\" an official said. \"They're going to be much less likely to pay the thousands of dollars that it's required to the smuggling networks that more or less control access to the routes leading up to our border.\"\n\nThere is, however, an exception for children who are crossing the border as unaccompanied minors, officials said.\n\nThe 2,500 number was picked because that's the number negotiated in the bipartisan border bill, officials said.\n\nOfficials said these steps will do what the border bill was intended to do: strengthen the immigration system.\n\n\"The president worked with [a] bipartisan group of senators to reach a historic border security agreement, an agreement that would have delivered significant policy changes, resources and personnel necessary to secure our border and make our country safer, and that would have made the asylum process fairer and more efficient while ensuring protection for the most vulnerable,\" an administration official said, placing the blame squarely on Congressional Republicans.\n\nEarlier this year, Senate Democrats and Republicans negotiated a bipartisan border bill that was effectively killed in the House at the behest of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The American people told us what they want,\" the official said. \"They want a secure border.\"\n\nOfficials also pushed back on the notion that the rule is similar to that of former President Trump's, which was broad and targeted people based on other factors such as their religion.\n\nAdministration officials said they have made changes to the executive rule that they believe would hold up in court.\n\nThe Department of Justice will be prepared to defend any litigation should it arise.\n\n\"DOJ defends lawsuits, rules and actions on a regular basis, and we are prepared for litigation on this rule,\" the official said. \"I think we are accustomed to being litigated frequently from both sides of a political spectrum for just about any measure we take in this space.\"\n\nChad Wolf, a Republican and former acting secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration, said that, from his perspective, the executive action won't make a dent in the \"asylum abuse\" that is being carried out along the border.\n\n\"There are holes in this plan,\" Wolf told \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday morning. \"This plan does nothing to stop the asylum abuse, does nothing to stop the parole abuse that this administration has done, nothing to stop catch and release. I see a lot of different holes here. I don't think it's going to work.

Cowen is headed to Washington on Tuesday, June 4, when Biden is expected to announce an executive order that will mark his latest and most aggressive plan to curtail the number of migrants allowed to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\nBy SEUNG MIN KIM, STEPHEN GROVES and COLLEEN LONG - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is telling lawmakers that President Joe Biden is preparing to sign off on an executive order that would shut down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters hits 2,500 at ports of entry, with the border reopening only once that number declines to 1,500, according to several people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe impact of the 2,500 figure means that the executive order could go into immediate effect, because daily figures are higher than that now.\n\nThe Democratic president is expected to unveil the actions -- his most aggressive unilateral move yet to control the numbers at the border -- at the White House on Tuesday at an event to which border mayors have been invited.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The figures are daily averages over the course of a week. All of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public.\n\nWhile other border activity, such as trade, is expected to continue, the 1,500 threshold at which the border would re-open for asylum seekers could be hard to reach. The last time the daily average dipped to 1,500 encounters was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, have been informing lawmakers on Capitol Hill of details of the planned order ahead of the formal rollout on Tuesday. But several questions remain about how the executive order would work, particularly how much cooperation the U.S. would need from Mexican officials to carry out the executive order.\n\nThe president has been deliberating for months over how to act on his own after bipartisan legislation to clamp down on asylum at the border collapsed because Republicans defected from the deal en masse at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Biden continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\n\nBiden administration officials had waited until after Mexico's presidential elections, held Sunday, to move on the U.S. president's border actions. Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum, the nation's first female leader, and Biden said in a statement Monday that he was committed to \"advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\" The two spoke on the phone Monday.\n\nThe executive order will allow Biden to declare that he has pushed the boundaries of his own power after lawmakers, specifically congressional Republicans, killed off what would have been the toughest border and asylum restrictions in some time. Biden's order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"He is trying to achieve with this executive order part of what would have been achieved by the bill, the bipartisan bill that was rejected by the Republicans and Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat. He said he was briefed on the pending directive.\n\nFor Biden's executive order, the White House is adopting some policies directly from that bipartisan Senate border deal, including the idea of limiting asylum requests once the encounters hit a certain number. The administration wants to encourage migrants to seek asylum at ports of entry by using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which schedules about 1,450 appointments per day.\n\nAdministration lawyers have been planning to tap executive powers outlined in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives a president broad authority to block entry of certain immigrants into the U.S. if it is deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. It is the same legal rationale used by Trump to take some of his toughest actions on migration as president.\n\nThat has advocacy groups already preparing to challenge Biden's immigration order in court.\n\n\"We will need to review the (executive order) before making final litigation decisions,\" said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who led several of the most high-profile challenges to Trump's border policies. \"But a policy that effectively shuts down asylum would raise clear legal problems, just as (it) did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum.\"\n\nBiden will unveil his executive order flanked by several border mayors whom the White House invited for the announcement. Texas Mayors John Cowen of Brownsville and Ramiro Garza of Edinburg both confirmed their invitations, and San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria's office also said the White House invited the mayor, but that he could not attend due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nJennifer Babaie, an attorney at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center in El Paso, Texas, said she would be alarmed if Biden issued formal deportation orders without an opportunity to seek asylum. Advocates worry that he may attempt that under the 212(f) provision.\n\nPandemic-era expulsion authority known as Title 42 had \"a silver lining\" for migrants because they could try again without fearing legal consequences, Babaie said. But a formal deportation order would expose them to felony prosecution if they attempted again and it would impose bars on legally entering the country in the future.\n\n\"This is even more extreme than (Title 42), while still putting people in harm's way,\" Babaie said.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat contributed to this report from San Diego.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.\n\nThe deterrent measures \"will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully,\" the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.\n\nKey operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive immigration policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally, a trend that has strained U.S. border authorities and cities receiving new arrivals. He is scheduled to speak at the White House at 2 p.m. EST.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nThe new restrictions resemble similar policies implemented by Trump and use a legal statute known as 212(f) that served as the underpinning for Trump's travel bans blocking people from several majority-Muslim nations and other countries.\n\nThe new restrictions are expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden for adopting Trump-like policies and backtracking on U.S. legal obligations to asylum seekers.\n\nIn advance of the announcement, Trump's campaign issued a statement criticizing Biden for high levels of illegal immigration and said the move to exempt unaccompanied minors would encourage child trafficking.\n\nINACTION IN CONGRESS\n\nBiden has pushed unsuccessfully for months to pass a Senate bill that would toughen border security, including with a provision that resembles his latest moves by executive action. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.\n\n\"Legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security and immigration reform,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo on Tuesday.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1. Biden's border restrictions could put pressure on Sheinbaum, the successor to current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to keep illegal border crossings down.\n\nLopez Obrador said at a daily press conference that he expected to speak with Biden over the phone as soon as Tuesday and that the countries \"have been making good progress\" on the issue of immigration.\n\nUnder the new measures, migrants who demonstrate a fear of being returned to their home countries will be screened for other types of humanitarian protection but could be deported if denied, the Biden official told reporters. Those who are removed will face at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\n\"These steps will strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate claims,\" the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a number of steps over the past year to toughen the asylum process, including issuing a regulation in May 2023 that heightened the standard for an initial asylum claim.\n\nBiden officials have said the effectiveness of U.S. enforcement is limited by a lack of resources in the absence of more funding from Congress.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters",

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nThe order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"", "source": {"uri":

Trump has made hard-line immigration policies a cornerstone of his campaign.\n\nThe executive order uses an authority known as \"212(f)\" - a regulation used under the Trump administration and widely denounced at the time by Democrats.\n\nThe executive action, which has been in the works for months, would severely restrict migrants from seeking asylum at the US southern border if they crossed the border unlawfully once daily encounters between ports of entry reached 2,500, meaning that the measure is likely to almost immediately take effect. Migrants could still request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry.\n\nUnaccompanied children would be exempt - a key piece of the executive order that would worry immigration advocates who have said such an exemption could encourage some families to send children to the border on their own.\n\nThe executive action would allow authorities to turn away migrants while in effect either to Mexico or their origin country. The US previously worked with Mexico when a Covid-19-era border restriction, known as Title 42, also resulted in certain migrants being returned to Mexico.\n\nSources who described the order to CNN cautioned that changes could still be made to the text before it was expected to be publicly unveiled this week.\n\nThe action would mark a significant policy shift for the Biden administration, which has taken a more aggressive approach to border security after years of grappling with border crises fueled by record migration as it has attempted to blunt Republican attacks during a heated election year.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt slammed Biden's expected order on Tuesday, saying the president is \"controlled by radical left Democrats.\" Trump sought to use a similar authority to clamp down on border crossings while in office, but was ultimately blocked by a federal appeals court.\n\nBorder authorities have recently been apprehending just under 4,000 migrants unlawfully crossing the border, according to a Homeland Security official, and there have been roughly 1,500 appointments per day through the US Customs and Border Protection mobile app.\n\nUnder the executive order, the border would reopen once daily illegal crossings drop, according to one of the sources.\n\nSenior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients, have been calling lawmakers and other stakeholders over the weekend to brief them on the plans, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nCNN first reported that the White House began outreach to border mayors to have them attend the announcement.\n\nEdinburg Mayor Ramiro Garza confirmed to CNN that the administration contacted him on Saturday to attend a Tuesday event at the White House. Brownsville Mayor John Cowen said he was invited as well and will attend. Harlingen Mayor Norma Sepulveda and Laredo Mayor Dr. Victor D. Trevino have also confirmed that they are expected to attend the event. McAllen Mayor Javier Villalobos also said he was invited but will be unable to attend.\n\nCNN's Camila DeChalus contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "abc7news.com", "dataType": "news",

That's why today, the president is announcing new historic executive actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nOfficials said the tough new curbs should take effect straightaway as the numbers of people crossing the border without proper documentation are already above the threshold. Asylum seekers would again be allowed to enter once the numbers dropped to 1,500 a day.\n\n\"We do expect that the authority would be in effect immediately,\" a Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nMr Biden himself was due to speak at the White House at 2:00pm (6:00pm Irish time).\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president and see Mr Biden moving closer to Republican Donald Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue heavily dragging on Mr Biden's re-election chances in November.\n\nMr Trump's campaign earlier dismissed the expected executive order as being \"for amnesty, not border security.\"\n\nThe statement repeated Mr Trump's frequent claims that illegal migrants are responsible for surges in violent crime - an allegation not supported by any major police or academic data.\n\nMigrants entering the United States are normally allowed to claim asylum if they face harm or persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\n\nHowever, many spend years waiting for their claims to be processed, with critics saying that many people cross purely for economic reasons and then play the system to remain in the United States.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Mr Biden was dealing with an immigration system that had been \"broken for decades.\"\n\nMs Jean-Pierre accused Republicans in Congress of \"partisan politics\" by failing to cooperate with Mr Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nUnder Mr Biden, border crossings have surged to record levels, rising to a peak of around 300,000 - 10,000 a day - in December.\n\nMost are from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change, but growing numbers are also coming from other parts of the world to Latin America before making the treacherous trip north to the United States.\n\nThe numbers have fallen considerably in recent months, to some 179,000 in April, but polls show it is still one of Mr Biden's biggest electoral liabilities.\n\nMr Biden's executive order aims to defuse Republican attacks and to woo middle-of-the-road voters worried about the state of the border. However, his plan will anger leftist Democrats and it will almost certainly be challenged in court by civil rights groups.\n\nThe White House moved to defuse criticisms that Mr Biden is effectively copying Mr Trump - even using the same laws as his predecessor for his new executive order.\n\n\"All of these policies are in stark contrast to how the previous administration managed immigration,\" a second senior administration official told reporters.\n\n\"They demonized immigrants, instituted mass raids, separated families at the border and put kids in cages. Their policies went against our values as a nation.\"\n\nMr Trump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and says he would enact the biggest deportation of migrants in history as soon as he takes office.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) previously posted on X in response to the proposed order.\n\n\"Why wait for the country to reach a breaking point when Biden could shut the border down TODAY if he wanted?\" she exclaimed.\n\nOther congressional Republicans dismissed Biden's move as an election-year stunt, since he already had rolled back Trump administration immigration policies via executive orders, including halting construction of a border wall as well as ending Title 42 and Remain in Mexico policies which kept birder numbers down.\n\nThose latter policies stemmed the flow of migrants on the southern border in particular by more than 70%, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in February.\n\nSince Biden entered office in January 2021, nearly 7 million migrants have been recorded entering illegally nationwide and roughly 1.7 million are known to have sneaked in without arrest.\n\nIn January, Biden, 81, said he had \"asked\" for the power to control the border \"from the very day I got into office\" and told reporters at this point he had \"done all I can do.\"\n\n\"Just give me the power,\" he said at the time. \"Give me the Border Patrol, give me the people, the judges -- give me the people who can stop this and make it work right.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has called on Democrats to pass new border legislation, calling its last effort \"the strongest border security bill we've seen in a generation\" while acknowledging not every member of his caucus voted for it.\n\nFederal authorities apprehended an average of 5,990 migrants per day on the southern border in April, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a number which does not include the known \"gotaways\" who aren't captured.\n\nMost of those arrested are then given court orders and released into the US to seek asylum.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Secretary said in 2019 that 1,000 illegal crossings per day would constitute an overwhelming crisis at the southern border.\n\nAccording to internal CBP data exclusively obtained by The Post, US Border Patrol recorded more than 10,000 migrants in custody nationwide on Wednesday.\n\nThe Biden administration also recently announced an order to process some migrants asylum claims if they claim to be heading to big cities such as Atlanta, New York or Los Angeles when they arrive at the border.\n\nIn February, the president had considered other executive actions to expel migrants if they cross the border illegally between ports of entry, according to Politico, and to swiftly deport those who do not have a \"credible fear\" of returning to their home country from the US.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now.\n\nThe restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"", "source": {"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an order on Tuesday which intends to shut down the US-Mexico border when the number of migrants crossing hits a certain level, as immigration emerges as a top voter concern in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe executive order will allow the United States to close the southern border to asylum seekers, temporarily removing longtime protections.\n\nIt will take effect if more than 2,500 migrants cross in a single day - a number which has become commonplace in recent months - meaning that the order could be instituted immediately. The order will be suspended if crossings drop below 1,500 people.\n\nDuring periods of suspension, anyone who crosses into the US without authorization would not be permitted to claim asylum \"absent exceptionally compelling circumstances\", according to senior administration official.\n\nExemptions would apply to \"children, victims of a severe form of trafficking, those experiencing an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life and safety,\" as well as \"other non-citizens who have a valid visa or some other lawful permission to enter the United States,' according to a Biden administration official.\n\nThe decision has met with backlash from progressive Democrats and immigration advocates, with some drawing similarities between Biden's border rule and what former president Donald Trump attempted to do while in office.\n\nCalifornia Senator Alex Padilla, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told The Independent that Biden's actions appeared to be \"paralleling some of what the Trump administration tried to do unsuccessfully\".\n\nIllinois Democrat Rep. Chuy Garcia, also told The Independent on Monday that he was concerned that the asylum restrictions could be \"eroding one of the things that sets us apart from every other country.\"\n\nFreshman Texas Democrat Representative Greg Casar noted that an \"enforcement-only approach\" would not help Biden politically because it would not solve the root causes of the record migration flows.\n\nHe also warned that the president is falling into what he described as a \"trap\" set by Republicans, and said that the way to make the border safe and take on cartels was to create legal pathways for migration and strengthen the asylum system.\n\nA Biden administration official, who asked for anonymity to brief reporters candidly, pushed back on the suggestion that Biden's immigration policy is comparable to Trump's border policies.\n\nThe Biden administration also pointed to efforts to expand lawful pathways into the US and a program where asylum seekers can use a Customs and Border Protection smartphone app to facilitate appointments at legal ports of entry.\n\nThe administration has also worked to establish processing centers abroad at which potential asylum seekers can begin the process rather than make their way to Mexico and cross illegally before presenting themselves to border agents.\n\nThe border action has been anticipated for months after Republicans voted against a bipartisan border bill earlier this year at the behest of presumptive Republican nominee Trump, who publicly said that passing the legislation would hand Democrats a win and help Biden in his re-election bid.\n\n\"The President worked with a bipartisan group of senators to reach a historic border security agreement, an agreement that would have delivered significant policy changes resources and personnel necessary to secure our border and make our country safer,\" a White House official said on Tuesday.\n\n\"[R]ational Republicans had an opportunity to support the fairest and toughest set of reforms in decades and they chose to put partisan political interests ahead of fixing our immigration system and securing our borders.\"\n\nRepublicans have criticized Biden's immigration policy as too lax and said it triggered an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border. They have frequently traveled to the US-Mexico border to criticize Biden and earlier this year, House Republicans impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, though the motion was tabled

The measures, similar to Trump-era policies, are in response to rising border arrests and are expected to face legal challenges from civil rights groups.\n\nMigrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border could be denied the chance to claim asylum and quickly deported or turned back to Mexico under new restrictions announced on Tuesday, part of a sweeping enforcement effort by U.S. President Joe Biden. The new measures will take effect immediately and will have exceptions for unaccompanied children, people who face serious medical or safety threats and victims of trafficking, a senior official said on a call with reporters.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for Americans in the run-up to Nov. 5 elections where he will face/ Republican Donald Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest. The new asylum restrictions are not permanent, the U.S. official told reporters. They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.\n\nThe deterrent measures \"will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully,\" the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call. Key operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive immigration policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally, a trend that has strained U.S. border authorities and cities receiving new arrivals. He is scheduled to speak at the White House at 2 p.m. EST. Trump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nThe new restrictions resemble similar policies implemented by Trump and use a legal statute known as 212(f) that served as the underpinning for Trump's travel bans blocking people from several majority-Muslim nations and other countries. The new restrictions are expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden for adopting Trump-like policies and backtracking on U.S. legal obligations to asylum seekers.\n\nIn advance of the announcement, Trump's campaign issued a statement criticizing Biden for high levels of illegal immigration and said the move to exempt unaccompanied minors would encourage child trafficking. INACTION IN CONGRESS\n\nBiden has pushed unsuccessfully for months to pass a Senate bill that would toughen border security, including with a provision that resembles his latest moves by executive action. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition. \"Legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security and immigration reform,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo on Tuesday.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement. Claudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1. Biden's border restrictions could put pressure on Sheinbaum, the successor to current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to keep illegal border crossings down.\n\nLopez Obrador said at a daily press conference that he expected to speak with Biden over the phone as soon as Tuesday and that the countries \"have been making good progress\" on the issue of immigration. Under the new measures, migrants who demonstrate a fear of being returned to their home countries will be screened for other types of humanitarian protection but could be deported if denied, the Biden official told reporters. Those who are removed will face at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\n\"These steps will strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate claims,\" the official said. The Biden administration has taken a number of steps over the past year to toughen the asylum process, including issuing a regulation in May 2023 that heightened the standard for an initial asylum claim.\n\nBiden officials have said the effectiveness of U.S. enforcement is limited by a lack of resources in the absence of more funding from Congress.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden will sign an executive order on June 4 that will shut down asylum requests at the southern border once the average number of daily encounters between ports of entry exceeds 2,500 people, and will remain shut until that daily average stays below 1,500 for at least a week.\n\nSenior administration officials confirmed the expected action, which is the Democratic president's most aggressive unilateral move made during his nearly-completed term.\n\nIt will take effect immediately as the daily encounter numbers already exceed the order's allowable limit, and it marks the latest of several recent moves by the administration to curb an immigration crisis that is seen as a key issue by many voters heading into November.\n\nPresident Biden is expected to sign the executive order next to several lawmakers from communities along the Mexico-U.S. border.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General will also jointly issue an interim final rule that will \"generally restrict asylum eligibility during periods of elevated border encounters for those who cross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization.\"\n\nThe action comes down as a proclamation under Immigration and Nationality Act sections 212(f) and 215(a) and will prohibit migrants who cross the southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum when, as one senior administration official said, \"high levels of encounters at the southern border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences.\"\n\nThis is the same statute former President Donald Trump cited during his term. Senior administration officials separated themselves from the previous administration's approach, saying that their actions, among other things, were only temporary, only applied to those entering unlawfully, were not based on religion, and were, overall, far more humane.\n\nHe said that the measures could go into effect when the average daily encounters of migrants between ports of entry along the southern border exceeds 2,500 for seven consecutive days, and they will remain in effect until 14 calendar days after the average number of daily encounters dropped below 1,500 for seven consecutive days.\n\nHowever, significant exceptions to the restrictions still remain.\n\nThose include migrants who \"manifest or express a fear of return to their country\" or a fear of prosecution or torture being referred to a \"credible fear screening with an asylum officer\" and unaccompanied minors.\n\nThis new rule also does not apply to those who use one of the \"lawful pathways\" to come into the United States, such as the CHNV asylum program, which officials confirmed brings in 30,000 people a month, and the CBP One app, which accounts for 1,400 people per day.\n\nThe official also noted that \"The United States will continue to adhere to its international obligations and commitments by screening individuals who are found to be ineligible for asylum for withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture protection at a reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard.\"\n\nThese new measures will also apply to migrants from China and other nations beyond the Western hemisphere and expressed confidence in their ability to \"impose an immediate and fast consequence to migrants no matter what country they're coming from.\"\n\nThe executive order also comes after legislation failed to pass the House and the Senate that would have also ordered the suspension of asylum requests and the automatic denial of entrance to migrants once the daily crossings exceeded a certain number.\n\nThat legislation, crafted by Senate Republicans and Democrats, included a plan to shut down the border for seven consecutive days if there is an average of 5,000 illegal immigrants encountered per day or if more than 8,500 illegal aliens are encountered in a single day. It also included the allowance of an additional 1,500 Customs and Border Protection agents and an additional 1,200 new Immigration and Customs Protection agents.\n\nSenior administration officials blasted congressional Republicans for failing to act.\n\n\"At that point in time, people understood that immigration shouldn't become a political football that we should put country over party,\" one senior administration official said. \"The reason we don't have the bipartisan bill today is very simple. Because the other administration, the prior administration's person, said, 'Don't do it. Don't give Joe Biden a victory.'\n\n\"That's not how we should run a country. And so that is unfortunate. An election year should not prohibit us from getting the people's work done.\"\n\nHowever, those against the legislation shared their opposition. Rep. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) stated in a post on X that he was voting against the bill because, among other things, it \"grants citizenship to illegal immigrants\" and codifies both the \"catch-and-release\" program and \"illegal entry via phone app.\"\n\nMr. Schmitt also said that the bill \"eviscerates [the] power of future presidents to secure [the] border by establishing a new MINIMUM number of illegal immigrants who must be admitted each day,\" and it would make \"invasion level migration permanent.\"\n\nPresident Biden ended several of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies on day one, including the \"stay in Mexico\" policy. Most migrants, including families, are then released into the United States while awaiting their asylum claim to be processed, which can take years. There are more than 2 million pending immigration court cases.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

set for Mexican border curbs with eye on Trump", "body": "US President Joe Biden is expected to announce steps Tuesday to close the Mexican border to asylum seekers when numbers surge, in a bid to tackle a key weak spot in his election battle with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, is set to sign a long-awaited executive order that would allow officials at certain times to deport migrants who cross the border illegally without processing their asylum claims first, US media reported.\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president, and see him moving further towards Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue drags on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nAn announcement is expected on Tuesday, sources close to the matter said, although the White House would not confirm reports that Biden will sign the executive order alongside mayors from border towns.\n\n\"What I can say is we are constantly and continuously looking at all options to try and really deal with the immigration system, a system that's been broken for decades,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nJean-Pierre blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to cooperate with Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"They decided to pick partisan politics,\" she said.\n\nBiden's curbs on asylum requests would kick in when illegal crossings hit 2,500 a day, and would not lift until numbers drop back to 1,500, several US media outlets reported.\n\n- Trump rhetoric -\n\nBut he faces opposition on several fronts.\n\nThe plans could anger some Democrats as they are the toughest by his party for years, and would rely on the use of the same law that Trump's administration used to ban immigration from some Muslim countries.\n\nThey would also almost certainly be challenged in court.\n\nRepublicans have sought to make the border a key issue ahead of the November 5 vote, portraying Biden as soft on stopping what Trump calls an \"invasion\" of migration.\n\nMore than 2.4 million migrants crossed the southern US border in 2023 alone, largely from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\nTrump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and raised the possibility of mass repatriations by the US military and detention camps.\n\nTrump and his allies have also accused Biden of operating an open border policy to boost Democratic voter numbers -- an allegation that Democrats decry as a racist conspiracy theory.\n\nBiden's administration has tried to curb crossings by working with Mexico and other countries to reduce migrant flows through enforcement and economic policies, but many voters appear to think he took his eye off the ball.\n\nThe US president's announcement is due just a day after he spoke with Claudia Sheinbaum, who was elected Mexico's first woman president, to offer his congratulations and pledge a \"strong and collaborative partnership\".\n\ndk/st\n\nMore from this section\n\nDovenmuehle

Biden issued a proclamation announcing the change under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nSenior administration officials framed the order as a response to congressional inaction on immigration after a bipartisan framework in the Senate was blocked by Republicans for a second time.\n\nAdministration officials walked a tightrope announcing the order, a forceful but targeted shift on asylum rights, one that administration officials said is not comparable to the Trump administration's system-wide crackdowns.\n\n\"There are several differences between the actions that we are taking today and Trump-era policies. The Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a call Monday.\n\nBut the order, which comes during an election year when immigration is set to play a key role, is almost certain to face legal challenges, as well as criticism from some on the left who have argued it echoes Trump's moves against the asylum system.\n\nThe core of the new policy is the ability to refuse entry to most foreign nationals who cross the border without prior authorization.\n\nFor purposes of immigration law, a foreign national enters the United States when they are lawfully admitted by a U.S. official; the new policy will prevent border officials from admitting new asylum seekers while it is active.\n\nThe order, an interim final rule released by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland, will kick in when the seven-day average of daily encounters at the southwest border and the southern coastal borders exceeds 2,500.\n\nWhen it does so, U.S. border officials will stop implementing credible fear interviews for asylum claims and work to quickly expel foreign nationals who've crossed the border between ports of entry.\n\nMigrants who are expelled under the order will receive a minimum five-year bar on re-entry to the United States and potentially be criminally prosecuted.\n\nAccording to administration officials, Mexico will receive nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as its own nationals, in expedited deportations.\n\nIt's unclear whether the Biden administration will have enough resources to quickly expel or to detain migrants barred from asylum, raising the possibility that more migrants will be released to the interior with orders of deportation rather than asylum claims, limiting their ability to apply for work permits.\n\nOfficials said the Biden administration will enhance its capabilities to return nationals of other countries, including extracontinental migrants from places such as China.\n\n\"We have been working tirelessly both in the region and throughout the world to enhance to both restrict the routes into the hemisphere for extra-hemispheric migrants ... and we've also been working with governments all over the world to enhance our ability to repatriate individuals to countries that have historically been challenging,\" an administration official told reporters.\n\nThe asylum restrictions will have exceptions.\n\nFor instance, they will not apply to unaccompanied minors, and officials will still be able to conduct credible interviews with migrants who manifest a fear of returning to their country because of persecution or potential torture situations.\n\nAccording to administration officials, the new policy will adhere to U.S. international obligations on treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, though that assessment will almost inevitably be challenged in court.\n\nOfficials also said the asylum crackdown will be bolstered several enforcement measures targeting smuggling networks and organizations that profit from migration in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe measures include revoking U.S. visas for government officials from places including Nicaragua, as well as top corporate officials from companies that provide services like transportation to migrants.\n\nAnd officials said the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will work in tandem to more quickly resolve the immigration cases of recent arrivals, looking to quickly expel or deport people without a valid asylum claim.\n\nSenior administration officials said the measure would take effect on Tuesday because the seven-day average of daily encounters at the border is more than 2,500, despite the fact that illegal crossings have been on the decline in recent months.\n\nOne official said the 2,500 number was determined based on similar numbers negotiated by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate as part of a border security deal that failed to pass the chamber.\n\n\"The goal here is to secure our border while preserving our values as a nation,\" one official said.\n\nWhile the measure would be lifted once the seven-day average of daily encounters drops below 1,500, that threshold could prove difficult to meet. The last time the average of daily encounters was below 1,500 was in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe timing of the order comes in the heart of an election year, where polling has consistently shown voters trust former President Trump -- the likely GOP nominee -- more than Biden on the issue of immigration and border security.\n\nSenior administration officials on Tuesday did not explicitly tie the timing of the order to the election, but they argued the measure was a result of congressional Republicans' inaction.\n\n\"If Congress refuses to act, and if congressional Republicans refuse to act, the president is prepared to do so,\" one official told reporters.\n\nThe president and White House officials previously said it was up to Congress to enact changes at the border and suggested Biden's hands were tied on the issues.\n\nThe president and his team lobbied hard for a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would have provided funding for thousands of additional Border Patrol agents, investments in technology to catch fentanyl and target drug traffickers and the addition of asylum officers and immigration officers who could help relieve the backlog of asylum cases.\n\nBut Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of that bill twice.\n\nTrump had urged Republicans to oppose the legislation, suggesting it could give Biden an election year win.\n\n\"For 3 years, America's border security has been devastated by congressional Republican opposition to the law enforcement resources that President Biden has sought,\" deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates wrote in a memo shared with reporters.\n\n\"For 3 years, Joe Biden has led on border security and congressional Republicans have obstructed it -- all in the name of politics,\" Bates added.\n\nRepublicans have chastised Biden for waiting to take executive action on the border and argued Tuesday's measure is too little, too late.", "source": {"uri":

The rule also raises the legal bar for an asylum claim at the border from reasonable possibility they will face torture at home to reasonable probability it will happen.\n\nThe heightened restrictions would end two weeks after the number of crossers stopped at the border dips below 1,500 for more than a week. Data shows that for most of the last nine years, border stops have not fallen below 1,500 per day.\n\n\"These measures will significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawfully\" and will \"allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States,\" said one of several senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe restrictions would not apply to those who enter at official ports of entry or use other legal means, including those who use a relatively new mobile app to request an appointment. It would also exempt certain groups, including unaccompanied children, victims of severe forms of trafficking and people with dire medical emergencies or extreme threats to life and safety.\n\nAdministration officials defended their efforts to secure the border, saying they have already returned more migrants in the past 12 months than in any year since 2010. They also sought to blame Republicans for Congress' failure to pass a bipartisan bill that would have given the administration more money and authority to control the border.\n\nOfficials conceded the president's executive action, which is likely to face legal challenges, is essentially a stopgap.\n\n\"There is no lasting solution to the challenges we are facing without Congress doing its job,\" one official said.\n\nWhile Mexico has agreed to take migrants from several Latin American countries, the administration is facing an increase in arrivals from other continents, including Asia. Officials said they were working to strengthen deals to fly people to India, China and other countries of origin, but said it remains a challenge.\n\nOfficials have faced a barrage from critics on the right, who blame Biden for what they call an out-of-control border, and on the left, who accuse him of replicating xenophobic policies advanced by former President Trump. Officials took pains to differentiate their policies from Trump's most well-known practices, including the attempts to ban the entry of people from Muslim-majority countries and to separate children from their families.\n\n\"We will not separate children from their families,\" said one official. \"It is not only inhumane, it's grossly ineffective.\"\n\nSeeking asylum, regardless of how someone arrives on U.S. soil, is a right under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act and international law. That issue proved problematic for the Trump administration's efforts to limit border crossings, and it could trip up Biden's latest order as well.\n\nAmy Fischer, Director of Refugee and Migrant Rights at Amnesty International USA, said the expected executive action \"plays into false narratives about the invasions at the border and advances a policy grounded in white supremacist ideas at the expense of people in search of safety in the U.S.\"\n\n\"President Biden's action sets a dangerous international precedent as a first-of-its-kind numerical cap on asylum, limiting the number of people who can claim asylum in the U.S. and effectively shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border, using the same legal authority that the Trump administration used to implement the dangerous and xenophobic Muslim and African travel bans,\" Fischer said.\n\nImmigration has been one of Biden's thorniest problems, practically and politically. He campaigned in large part on reversing Trump's most hardline policies and rhetoric, but after Biden assumed office, border crossings and arrests rose dramatically.\n\nPolls show many voters rate immigration and the border as a top issue, often alongside the economy, character, democracy and abortion. It's also the area where they are most likely to rate Trump ahead of Biden, according to an ABC News poll released last month showing 47% of Americans trust Trump more on the issue, compared with 30% who trust Biden more.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type":

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nThe order will go into effect when the number of border encounters between ports of entry hits 2,500 per day, according to senior administration officials. That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated

A bipartisan Senate plan that would have given Biden similar powers was blocked by Republicans at Trump's behest earlier this year, denying the president a political win and prompting him to act unilaterally.\n\nTuesday's order is politically risky. It will invite criticism from Biden's left flank, which has blasted moves to ramp up deportations as an inhumane approach to the crisis. That has the potential to stymie his efforts to shore up an electoral coalition already riven by divisions over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and overarching concerns over his age and fitness to serve a second term. -Bloomberg\n\nThe Biden administration's move underscores how the administration has been compelled to act just months before the 2024 US election - as it's become a centerpiece issue for Republicans on the campaign trail. Donald Trump has been constantly hammering Biden over the border as polls continue to show that voters think the border and immigration are critical issues.\n\nThe Executive Order is also timed to reflect an effort to deter a seasonal increase in crossings that typically occurs each summer and early fall (right before the election), and comes as Mexico welcomes a new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who was elected on Sunday. She doesn't take office until Oct. 1, and it's unknown what actions she will take on the border situation.\n\nIn recent weeks the Biden administration has taken other steps to tighten immigration rules. Last month, they proposed a rule that would allow the US to expedite the expulsion of certain undocumented migrants trying to claim asylum.\n\nAccording to the report, Biden will use Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act - which Trump invoked - which are anticipated to invite legal challenges.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News Sunday that the move is \"too little too late,\" adding \"The only reason he's doing that is because the polls say that it's the biggest issue in America.\"", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sheinbaum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Sheinbaum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-06/1200x800_jpg_92b.jpg?itok=UE5jMQUt", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 2613, "textEnd": 2619}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Migrants would be returned to their home countries or Mexico and ineligible for asylum once the limit is surpassed, according to the Washington Post. At least two mayors of Texas border cities confirmed to the AP that they were invited by the White House to attend an announcement event.\n\nIt's unclear what the threshold in Biden's order will be, but the Post reported that the cap could be an average of 2,500 to 3,000 daily crossings. A since-quashed bipartisan immigration bill proposed capping the number of migrant encounters at an average of 4,000 per day over the course of a week. The measure was stalled in the Senate earlier this year largely due to opposition from former President Donald Trump.\n\nMigrants have been trying to enter the country at record levels during Biden's term. U.S. Border Patrol encounters with migrants - or stops - at the southern border reached nearly 250,000 in December, marking a monthly high before dropping by 50% in January. While stops ticked back up in February and then decreased again two months in a row, annual encounters exceeded 2 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, far surpassing totals during the Trump administration - making immigration a political thorn in Biden's side.\n\nWith the November election rematch of Biden versus Trump approaching, Biden has struggled to appease voters on immigration, which has become a top issue for Americans. A RealClearPolitics polling average from March to May showed that nearly 63% of respondents disapprove of the president's handling of immigration.\n\nThis has led Biden to be more aggressive when it comes to messaging and actions related to the border. In early May, the administration proposed a new rule that \"would allow asylum officers to reject a subset of asylum seekers earlier in the process based on several factors,\" according to the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. Currently, these factors or \"bars\" are otherwise considered later in the process, at a full hearing before an immigration judge. The rule is currently subject to a formal comment period which is scheduled to end on June 12.\n\nOne of the many vague aspects of the new, seemingly imminent order is just how the denial process would work, and what sort of exceptions would be allowed. Unaccompanied children, for instance, are expected to be exempt from the policy, according to reporting by CBS News. But Cris Ram\u00f3n, a senior adviser on immigration for UnidosUS, which serves the Hispanic community through research, policy analysis and state and national advocacy efforts, predicts that the order would require increased processing of people for removal through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, \"which has really faced chronic funding shortages.\" He also questions the impact of the policy because he expects legal challenges.\n\n\"You can argue all you want that, 'Well, we should shut down the border,'\" Ram\u00f3n says. \"That's nice, but the question is, sure, you want to do that, but do you actually have the resources to make it happen? And I don't think people, when they say this is the solution, are really thinking about those operational considerations.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas told the New York Times that he had been briefed about the pending order and that he \"certainly\" supports it because he's been \"advocating for these measures for years.\"\n\nRegardless of the logistics, some advocates are expressing concern about the potential order.\n\n\"Our best understanding is that this is going to be an announcement that will essentially allow the government to 'close the border' based on the number of people who are arriving in the United States, which would make this a historically tragic day, I would say,\" says Heidi Altman, the director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center, a nonprofit that works to ensure human rights protections and access to justice for all immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. \"We have significant legal concerns about this.\n\n\"The notion of essentially turning people who are seeking asylum away simply because of the number that they were in the order of people who arrived that day raises really major red flags in terms of the United States' compliance with the Refugee Convention,\" she adds.\n\nThe Biden administration has urged Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform and some question the value of an executive order without broader legislation.\n\n\"Ultimately, even if this proposed executive action succeeds in reducing border encounters in the short term, it's only a Band-Aid without action from Congress,\" Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement released on Monday. \"If we want to reduce numbers at the border, we need a reasonable conversation about alternative ways for people to make their cases for asylum and other humanitarian protections - and about other potential legal-migration pathways that help promote order and fairness.\"\n\nAltman points to reports that Biden is planning to base the order on a presidential authority known as 212(f), which \"authorizes the President to suspend entry into the United States.\" She says if this is true, the policy is \"really just pulling a page\" from the Trump era, when the former president used the authority to ban entry from several Muslim-majority countries - an order the Biden overturned on his first day in office. Murray also said Biden's use of this authority would be \"concerning.\"\n\n\"What this threatens to do is really to sort of remove the ability to clearly distinguish between the two administration's approaches,\" Altman adds.\n\nAnd with Election Day just about 5 months away, she says the administration is playing politics.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's playing politics with people's lives,\" Altman says. \"It certainly appears to be the president and the White House being willing to sign a document that will knowingly send people back to harm, to torture, maybe to death, in order to score political points. And that's upsetting.\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden",

They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.\n\nThe deterrent measures \"will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully,\" the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.\n\nKey operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive immigration policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally, a trend that has strained U.S. border authorities and cities receiving new arrivals. He is scheduled to speak at the White House at 2 p.m. EST.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nThe new restrictions resemble similar policies implemented by Trump and use a legal statute known as 212(f) that served as the underpinning for Trump's travel bans blocking people from several majority-Muslim nations and other countries.\n\nThe new restrictions are expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden for adopting Trump-like policies and backtracking on U.S. legal obligations to asylum seekers.\n\nIn advance of the announcement, Trump's campaign issued a statement criticizing Biden for high levels of illegal immigration and said the move to exempt unaccompanied minors would encourage child trafficking.\n\nBiden has pushed unsuccessfully for months to pass a Senate bill that would toughen border security, including with a provision that resembles his latest moves by executive action. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.\n\n\"Legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security and immigration reform,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo on Tuesday.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1. Biden's border restrictions could put pressure on Sheinbaum, the successor to current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to keep illegal border crossings down.\n\nLopez Obrador said at a daily press conference that he expected to speak with Biden over the phone as soon as Tuesday and that the countries \"have been making good progress\" on the issue of immigration.\n\nUnder the new measures, migrants who demonstrate a fear of being returned to their home countries will be screened for other types of humanitarian protection but could be deported if denied, the Biden official told reporters. Those who are removed will face at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\n\"These steps will strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate claims,\" the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a number of steps over the past year to toughen the asylum process, including issuing a regulation in May 2023 that heightened the standard for an initial asylum claim.\n\nBiden officials have said the effectiveness of U.S. enforcement is limited by a lack of resources in the absence of more funding from Congress.", "source": {"uri": "asia.nikkei.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nikkei Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., one of the architects of this year's failed bipartisan border bill said.\n\nA group of about 100 migrants wanting to cross into the U.S. along the Rio Grande in Mexico are shepherded away from the border by Mexican Army personnel on May 30\n\n'Republicans are unwilling to provide the resources to fix the problem because they don't want to fix the problem,' he added, shifting the blame to the GOP.\n\n'I think what we built would have worked in bringing order along the border in part because it was paired with some pretty significant reforms to the sound system and a massive increase in resources.'\n\nMurphy claims that because Biden's plan does not include additional resources to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the enforcement of such an action would be hampered.\n\nBeyond the question of how will this order be enforced - the Democrat said he does not expect Biden's plan to be legal.\n\n'I doubt that this is going to pass judicial muster,' Murphy said. 'It's a pretty extraordinary exercise of executive power.'\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., lamented that Congress failed the president, forcing him to take action.\n\n'Joe Biden has made clear that his number one choice is for Congress to act,' she told DailyMail.com. 'Congress's failings have forced Joe Biden into this move.'\n\n'He needs better tools. Congress has failed to do what it needs to do, both to give us border security and create a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here.'\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said in a statement: 'By reviving Trump's asylum ban, President Biden has undermined American values and abandoned our nation's obligations to provide people fleeing persecution, violence, and authoritarianism with an opportunity to seek refuge in the U.S.'\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., an architect of the Senate's twice-failed bipartisan border and immigration deal, said that Biden's planned executive action won't work and likely will not 'pass legal muster'\n\nReports of the plan indicate that Biden would disallow asylum claims once a threshold of migrants claiming asylum in a week has been met. Migrants who enter illegally after that threshold is met would not meet enhanced DHS patrols, but would not be able to claim they are asylees, which are entitled to a long legal process to determine the validity of their claims\n\nPreviously Joe Biden and the White House have said they want Congress to make new laws for him to enforce on the border. Now, the White House is expected to go it alone and unilaterally order immigration reforms, something GOP lawmakers have said he could've done all along\n\nOver in the House, Democrats also opposed Biden's plan.\n\n'I'm concerned that this is just the enforcement-only side of the strategy,' Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., told DailyMail.com.\n\n'The bottom line is House Democrats believe we can and should secure our border while opening up more legal pathways.'\n\nThe Californian said Biden should look to bolster temporary protected immigration statuses for those who cross into the U.S. illegally.\n\n'Those are things that we can do and the Biden administration should be looking at,' Aguilar continued.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a statement: 'It is extremely disappointing to see the Biden administration severely restricting access to asylum.'\n\n'This attempt to shut down the border to asylum seekers uses the same section of U.S. immigration laws that convicted felon Donald Trump used to implement the Muslim Ban and in attempts to cut off all access to asylum.'\n\n'While there are some differences from Trump's actions, the reality is that this utilizes the same failed enforcement-only approach, penalizes asylum seekers, and furthers a false narrative that these actions will 'fix' the border,' Jayapal continued.\n\nA drone view shows the U.S.-Mexico border wall, in Jacumba Hot Springs, California. The area has been a hotspot of illegal immigration in recent months with people coming from all over the world to cross here - not just individuals from Central or South America\n\nMigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border are told to move away from the wall by Mexican soldiers\n\nAsylum-seeking migrants from Ecuador read a paper, which was handed out by a local volunteer, while waiting to be transported by the U.S. Border Patrol after crossing the border from Mexico into the U.S.\n\nRepublicans have also bashed the plan, calling it an election year maneuver to give Biden the facade of being tough on immigration.\n\n'Our borders have been left vulnerable and the safety of our citizens compromised. And here we stand just five months before this critical election with Joe Biden and the Democrats grasping for a political lifeline,' Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said at a Tuesday Senate GOP press event to bash the Biden plan.\n\n'Their recent announcement is nothing more than a desperate ploy to distract from their failures,' he added.\n\nSen. Blackburn, R-Tenn., expressed the same sentiments at the event.\n\n'Human trafficking, the sex trafficking, the numbers are adding up and here you go with an election year political gimmick to try to push this issue aside so that [Biden] can go to a debate and say, 'Well, I did something.''\n\nAn energized Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., said at the presser that Biden and Democrat lawmakers have presided over 'a criminal invasion of the United States' by allowing over 10 million migrants to enter the U.S. since the president took office.\n\nHe alleged that Biden 'deliberately broke the system' and now in an election year the president is trying to fix it.\n\n'On day one of his presidency, Joe Biden rolled into the White House. He got into the Oval, and he dismantled everything that President Trump had in place that kept a lid on these illegal border crossings,' Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said.\n\n'So now here we are years later, and it has taken 10 million illegal border crossings for President Biden to step up and acknowledge that there is a crisis at the border and you know what, folks? It's his own making.'\n\nAfter the event concluded Ernst was heard whispering into a live microphone.\n\n'Bottom line, never trust a man whose uncle was eaten by cannibals,' an apparent jab at Biden for claiming that his uncle who died in WWII was eaten by people in Papa New Guinea.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

The asylum seekers were spotted entering the country through the hole near San Diego in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nThe group was composed of migrants from Mauritania, Nepal, India , China , Vietnam and others according to Fox correspondent Bill Melugin who was at the scene. The migrants reported minimal resistance on their way and described breezing past the Mexican military.\n\nIt comes as the White House revealed President Biden is preparing to sign off an order to temporarily shut down the border once a daily threshold of crossings has been met. The video shows a handful of migrants posing up alongside the wall as if it were a 'tourist attraction' according to Melugin.\n\nThe clip has once again spotlighted the border crisis, which has become a flashpoint ahead of the election as crossings continue to surge. Biden has been under pressure to get a grip on the numbers , with polls showing a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with his handling of the situation.\n\nThe current number of crossings remains high, with 179,725 encounters recorded in April The executive order that would shut down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters hits 2,500 between ports of entry.\n\nThe border would only reopen once that number declines to 1,500, according to several people familiar with the discussions. The 2,500 figure means that the executive order could go into immediate effect because daily figures are currently above this.\n\nThe president has been deliberating over how to act on the border after his bipartisan legislation to clamp down on crossings collapsed. Republicans defected from the deal at the urging of Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nBiden has continued to consider executive action even though the number of illegal crossings at the southern border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico . The order is aimed at trying to head off any potential spike in border encounters that could happen later this year, closer to the November elections.\n\nTrump's campaign said in a statement that the order would not be effective and that if 'Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen .'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Here's the latest at the end of Monday.\n\nPresident Biden is expected to sign an executive order tomorrow allowing him to temporarily seal the U.S. border with Mexico to migrants when crossings surge. The move, which is all but certain to be challenged in court, would represent the single most restrictive border policy instituted by Biden, or any other modern Democrat.\n\nThe order would allow border officials to turn away migrants who claim asylum once border crossings exceed a certain threshold -- restricting what has long been the surest way for migrants to stay in the U.S. White House officials have discussed setting the cutoff at 2,500 illegal crossings per day. If that level is set, the border would immediately be closed because roughly 3,500 migrants are currently apprehended each day.\n\nBiden pushed Congress earlier this year to enact a similar policy into law, but Republicans thwarted the bill, saying it was not strong enough. Now under intense political pressure to address illegal migration, a top concern of voters ahead of the November election, the president has decided to use his executive authority.\n\nBiden's move underscores how the politics of immigration have tilted to the right. Many Democrats, including Biden, condemned a similar effort by Donald Trump in 2018 to restrict long-established protections for asylum seekers. Federal courts blocked his attempt.

Having had such loose immigration enforcement, I am not sure how the US puts the genie in the bottle. Yes, there are legal and moral reasons to allow asylum-seekers to enter. But the evidence is strong that most immigrants who seek entry via the Mexico border are economic migrants and not victims of persecution. And it's also painfully difficult, save for prominent figures (or victims of targeting of particular ethnic groups) to determine if most asylum claims are bona fide.\n\nSo it's bothersome to see painfully well-meaning articles pretend that the US does not have a big problem with illegal economic immigrants, both currently and historically. And this does not sit well with workers who suffer from competition from them, as well as entrants who went through the legal hoops to have the right to live and seek employment here.\n\nBy Jessica Corbett, staff writer at Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams\n\nMigrant rights advocates were outraged by Monday reporting that U.S. President Joe Biden plans to hold an event at the White House on Tuesday to unveil a long-feared executive order that would block people from seeking asylum when the number of unlawful border crossings hits a certain threshold.\n\nBiden's order \"would shut down asylum requests to the U.S.-Mexico border once the number of daily encounters hits 2,500 between ports of entry, with the border reopening once that number declines to 1,500,\" according toThe Associated Press -- and various other media outlets that also cited unnamed officials who cautioned that the final figures could still change.\n\nThe Democrat is expected to invoke Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was previously used by former President Donald Trump -- the presumptive Republican nominee to face Biden in November -- and sparked legal challenges.\n\n\"We will need to see the E.O. before making any litigation decisions,\" Lee Gelernt, an attorney who serves as deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, toldAxios of Biden's expected move. \"Any policy that effectively ends asylum protection for people fleeing danger would raise significant legal problems, as it did when Trump tried to end asylum.\"\n\nIn response to a social media account tracking \"Biden's Wins,\" which welcomed the reported order, Gelernt's ACLU colleague Gillian Branstetter said: \"This is not a 'win' -- it's a monstrosity. Asylum is a human right.\"\n\nAfter one social media user sarcastically told Branstetter, \"I'm sure you'll love Trump's border policies,\" she stressed, \"This is Trump's border policy.\"\n\nAmerican Immigration Council policy director Aaron Reichlin-Melnick similarly said that \"the politics may have changed by the law hasn't; Trump tried to invoke section 212(f) to block asylum at the border and was slapped down in court. Biden's effort to do the same will also face immediate legal challenges.\"\n\nReichlin-Melnick also highlighted a policy brief that the American Immigration Lawyers Association released in response to the reports, which takes aim at both the legality and effectiveness of the Biden administration's supposed plans.\n\n\"The decision by this administration to criminalize migrants -- many of whom are fleeing harm -- is deeply disturbing and misguided,\" said Sarah M. Rich, senior supervising attorney and interim senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a statement. \"We have witnessed how such prosecutions can be weaponized to separate and traumatize immigrant families.\"\n\n\"Prosecuting people seeking safety in the U.S. for these immigration violations will lead to more Black and Brown people being incarcerated at the expense of immigrant families and communities,\" Rich continued. \"We call on the Biden administration to instead adopt a humane and welcoming immigration framework that centers our values as a nation that welcomes immigrants.\"\n\nCNN reported that \"unaccompanied children would be exempt -- a key piece of the executive order that would worry immigration advocates who have said such an exemption could encourage some families to send children to the border on their own.\"\n\nSave the Children U.S. declared that \"seeking asylum is a basic human right. We've seen what happens when children and families are separated and their right to safety is restricted. We can't let that happen again.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Congressman Henry Cuellar, a right-wing Texas Democrat who has criticized Biden for not increasing border enforcement and is currently battling bribery charges, praised the president's pending policy.\n\n\"I've been briefed on the pending executive order,\" said Cuellar. \"I certainly support it because I've been advocating for these measures for years. While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far.\"\n\nAt least five Texas mayors have been invited to the White House for the Tuesday event, according to CNN. Plans for the order come a few weeks before the first presidential debate of the 2024 cycle and follow the proposal last month of U.S. Department of Homeland Security rule to fast-track the rejection of certain asylum requests, which was condemned as a \"return to failed Trump-era policies.\"\n\nThe reporting also follows the Sunday electoral victory of the next Mexican president, leftist Claudia Sheinbaum -- who on Monday received a congratulatory call from Biden. The AP noted that \"the number of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\"\n\nBiden's anticipated action would also come after the U.S. Senate again killed the bipartisan Border Act. While Republican senators blocked the legislation at the direction of Trump, who wants to continue campaigning for president on immigration policy, the measure was also opposed by progressive lawmakers and advocates.\n\nAmong the few Democrats who spoke out against the Border Act was Sen. Alex Padilla of California. Praising his floor speech last month, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies said that \"this bill offers no solutions for immigrants and refugees. No measures to actually address the humanitarian and operational challenges at the border. Just more cruelty and chaos.\"", "source": {"uri": "nakedcapitalism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "naked capitalism"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yves_smith@nakedcapitalism.com", "name": "Yves Smith",

The restrictions can only be lifted when border crossings are reduced to 1,500 crossings across a certain number of days.\n\nPrior to the order, asylum seekers entering the U.S. were granted the same rights as those who had entered at legal ports of entry, in accordance with U.S. and international law. Because border crossings between ports of entry are currently exceeding 2,500 people, the executive order could be enforced as soon as this week, resulting in mass deportations of people who crossed into the U.S. seeking protection.\n\nMigrant advocates have fiercely condemned the move, saying that Biden has repeatedly used migrants as political pawns to appease anti-immigrant voices on the right during an election year where the issue of immigration will feature prominently.\n\nThe order utilizes Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act -- the same law former President Donald Trump, Biden's Republican opponent in the 2024 election, relied on to enact his own racist immigration orders while in office. Trump described the rule as his \"magical authority\" to crack down on immigration, utilizing it to enforce his egregious Muslim travel ban, restrict immigrants from countries with Black or Brown populations from coming to the U.S., and more.\n\nBiden criticized Trump's immigration policy when politically expedient, overturning the Muslim ban, for instance, in his first days in office. Now, he's using the same rule to deport migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., enforcing the most restrictive immigration policy by any Democratic president in recent history.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have denounced the policy, which is similar to a proposal that was included in an administration-backed bipartisan bill earlier this year (which failed when Republicans blocked its passage after Trump urged them to reject the bill for political reasons).\n\n\"We should be distinguishing ourselves from Donald Trump on immigration. We should be offering the contrast,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\n\"I do not think that shutting down the border, quote unquote, is a remedy that will get us to where we need to be on immigration reform,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Democrat from the border state of Texas, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe executive order will undoubtedly face legal challenges from pro-immigrant rights organizations, which have noted that the action is in violation of international law.\n\n\"The Biden administration's reported plan to cap asylum requests is a violation of U.S. refugee law and the Refugee Convention,\" said Marisa Lim\u00f3n Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Rights Center.\n\nOther immigrant rights activists condemned Biden for his concessions to the right, saying that such policies criminalize migrant families and send the dangerous message that their lives are expendable.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that politics are driving the immigration conversation in an increasingly restrictive direction,\" said Jennie Murray, President and CEO of the National Immigration Forum. \"While there's no question the U.S. needs to better address challenges at the border, the use of 212(f) authority is concerning.\"\n\nMurray added:\n\nDisplacement worldwide is at record highs. People are fleeing dangerous and sometimes life-threatening situations. If we want to reduce numbers at the border, we need a reasonable conversation about alternative ways for people to make their cases for asylum and other humanitarian protections.\n\nSilky Shah, executive director of the Detention Watch Network, condemned Biden for endangering the lives of migrants for political gain.\n\nBiden's order \"is a result of years of Democrats ceding ground to Republicans on the issue moving everything further to the right,\" Shah said on the social media site X. \"Mainstream [immigrant rights] groups accepted border restrictions as a tradeoff for legalization & now only the former is on the table.\"\n\nIn an op-ed for Truthout in March, Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, wrote that Biden has repeatedly cosigned a \"racist and immoral right-wing border policy agenda.\"\n\n\"President Biden continues to show he has no reluctance to advocate for cruel and racist policies that will lead to more immigration detention, more family separation and more migrant lives in jeopardy,\" he wrote.\n\nOn Biden's inauguration day, the number of migrants in ICE prisons was near 14,000 -- a two-decade low, Ghandehari pointed out. That number is now approaching 40,000, and Biden is lobbying Congress for funds to imprison thousands more.\n\n\"Politicians are playing political games with people's lives, and many across the country are fed up with Biden pointing fingers at the other side while rapidly moving to the right, instead of taking real steps to welcome people with dignity and respect,\" Ghandehari added.",

Asylum is a human right.\"\n\nAfter one social media user sarcastically told Branstetter, \"I'm sure you'll love Trump's border policies,\" she stressed, \"This is Trump's border policy.\"\n\nAmerican Immigration Council policy director Aaron Reichlin-Melnick similarly said that \"the politics may have changed by the law hasn't; Trump tried to invoke section 212(f) to block asylum at the border and was slapped down in court. Biden's effort to do the same will also face immediate legal challenges.\"\n\nReichlin-Melnick also highlighted a policy brief that the American Immigration Lawyers Association released in response to the reports, which takes aim at both the legality and effectiveness of the Biden administration's supposed plans.\n\n\"The decision by this administration to criminalize migrants -- many of whom are fleeing harm -- is deeply disturbing and misguided,\" said Sarah M. Rich, senior supervising attorney and interim senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a statement. \"We have witnessed how such prosecutions can be weaponized to separate and traumatize immigrant families.\"\n\n\"Prosecuting people seeking safety in the U.S. for these immigration violations will lead to more Black and Brown people being incarcerated at the expense of immigrant families and communities,\" Rich continued. \"We call on the Biden administration to instead adopt a humane and welcoming immigration framework that centers our values as a nation that welcomes immigrants.\"\n\nCNNreported that \"unaccompanied children would be exempt -- a key piece of the executive order that would worry immigration advocates who have said such an exemption could encourage some families to send children to the border on their own.\"\n\nSave the Children U.S. declared that \"seeking asylum is a basic human right. We've seen what happens when children and families are separated and their right to safety is restricted. We can't let that happen again.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Congressman Henry Cuellar, a right-wing Texas Democrat who has criticized Biden for not increasing border enforcement and is currently battling bribery charges, praised the president's pending policy.\n\n\"I've been briefed on the pending executive order,\" said Cuellar. \"I certainly support it because I've been advocating for these measures for years. While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far.\"\n\nAt least five Texas mayors have been invited to the White House for the Tuesday event, according to CNN. Plans for the order come a few weeks before the first presidential debate of the 2024 cycle and follow the proposal last month of U.S. Department of Homeland Security rule to fast-track the rejection of certain asylum requests, which was condemned as a \"return to failed Trump-era policies.\"\n\nThe reporting also follows the Sunday electoral victory of the next Mexican president, leftist Claudia Sheinbaum -- who on Monday received a congratulatory call from Biden. The AP noted that \"the number of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border has declined for months, partly because of a stepped-up effort by Mexico.\"\n\nBiden's anticipated action would also come after the U.S. Senate again killed the bipartisan Border Act. While Republican senators blocked the legislation at the direction of Trump, who wants to continue campaigning for president on immigration policy, the measure was also opposed by progressive lawmakers and advocates.\n\nAmong the few Democrats who spoke out against the Border Act was Sen. Alex Padilla of California. Praising his floor speech last month, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies said that \"this bill offers no solutions for immigrants and refugees. No measures to actually address the humanitarian and operational challenges at the border. Just more cruelty and chaos.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden",

for Mexican border curbs with eye on Trump", "body": "US President Joe Biden is expected to announce steps Tuesday to close the Mexican border to asylum seekers when numbers surge, in a bid to tackle a key weak spot in his election battle with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, is set to sign a long-awaited executive order that would allow officials at certain times to deport migrants who cross the border illegally without processing their asylum claims first, US media reported.\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president, and see him moving further towards Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue drags on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nAn announcement is expected on Tuesday, sources close to the matter said, although the White House would not confirm reports that Biden will sign the executive order alongside mayors from border towns.\n\n\"What I can say is we are constantly and continuously looking at all options to try and really deal with the immigration system, a system that's been broken for decades,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nJean-Pierre blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to cooperate with Biden, and for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border which the president tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"They decided to pick partisan politics,\" she said.\n\nBiden's curbs on asylum requests would kick in when illegal crossings hit 2,500 a day, and would not lift until numbers drop back to 1,500, several US media outlets reported.\n\n- Trump rhetoric -\n\nBut he faces opposition on several fronts.\n\nThe plans could anger some Democrats as they are the toughest by his party for years, and would rely on the use of the same law that Trump's administration used to ban immigration from some Muslim countries.\n\nMore from this section Putin's Men Devastated As Ukraine Unleashes U.S.-Supplied HIMARS, Multiple Explosions Inside Russia Man killed, dozens injured in Ohio shooting Peekskill considers expanding outdoor smoking ban to outdoor dining downtown\n\nThey would also almost certainly be challenged in court.\n\nRepublicans have sought to make the border a key issue ahead of the November 5 vote, portraying Biden as soft on stopping what Trump calls an \"invasion\" of migration.\n\nMore than 2.4 million migrants crossed the southern US border in 2023 alone, largely from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\nTrump spent his time in office trying to build a wall on the Mexican border and has drastically ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and raised the possibility of mass repatriations by the US military and detention camps.\n\nTrump and his allies have also accused Biden of operating an open border policy to boost Democratic voter numbers -- an allegation that Democrats decry as a racist conspiracy theory.\n\nBiden's administration has tried to curb crossings by working with Mexico and other countries to reduce migrant flows through enforcement and economic policies, but many voters appear to think he took his eye off the ball.\n\nThe US president's announcement is due just a day after he spoke with Claudia Sheinbaum, who was elected Mexico's first woman president, to offer his congratulations and pledge a \"strong and collaborative partnership\".\n\ndk/st", "source":

The border would reopen only once that number falls to 1,500. The president's order would come under the Immigration and Nationality Act sections 212(f) and 215(a) suspending entry of noncitizens who cross the southern border into the United States unlawfully.\n\nSenior administration officials said Tuesday in a call with reporters that \"individuals who cross the southern border unlawfully or without authorization will generally be ineligible for asylum, absent exceptionally compelling circumstances, unless they are accepted by the proclamation.\"\n\nThe officials said that migrants who don't meet the requirement of having a \"credible fear\" when they apply for asylum will be immediately removable, and they \"anticipate that we will be removing those individuals in a matter of days, if not hours,\"\n\nThe White House conveyed details of the long-awaited move to lawmakers on Monday, but confirmed details of the executive order Tuesday morning ahead of planned remarks by the president in the East Room of the White House alongside mayors from several border towns.\n\n\"It's definitely a step in the right direction,\" said Texas state Rep. Eddie Jones, Jr., whose district includes Eagle Pass, Texas. \"One of a number of steps that are necessary for us to be able to secure the border.\"\n\nIn 2018, the Trump administration tried to enact similar border restrictions but courts blocked them. The Biden administration now expects to defend the executive order against legal challenges.\n\nThe executive order will also have some exceptions, including for unaccompanied children.\n\nIn a written statement, Donald Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavett claimed that exception would give a \"green light to child traffickers and sex traffickers\" while reiterating the former president's rallying cry that \"the border invasion and migrant crime will not stop until Crooked Joe Biden is deported from the White House.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers are slamming the move as too little, too late.\n\n\"(Biden) created a crisis at the border intentionally,\" said Sen. Kevin Cramer . R-ND. \"(The executive action) has more political risk than political benefit, particularly because his own base is going to reject it.\"\n\nBut the White House has repeatedly argued that it was congressional Republicans who have failed to act on immigration. Earlier this year, Trump urged House GOP members to kill a bipartisan border funding bill that had been negotiated in the Senate. At the time, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans said that the Senate bill didn't go far enough and they argued that a more hardline immigration bill in the House was preferable.\n\n\"President Biden has led a historic opening of lawful pathways for individuals to and including families, to enter the United States through a lawful process, including the CBP One mobile application to request an appointment to present at a port of entry, as well as family reunification programs in countries throughout the region and a historic parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans,\" a senior administration official said. \"And so this measure that we are announcing today comes alongside those lawful pathways,\"\n\nThe executive action comes on the heels of a historic presidential election in Mexico and just as the campaign in the U.S. ramps up. Trump has a 30-point edge with registered voters on the question of which candidate would handle immigration and border security better, including a 23-point edge among Latino voters, according to a late-March CNBC national poll.\n\nMany immigrant advocates are furious at the president's harsher immigration policies and argue the changes will cause chaos.\n\n\"It is a betrayal of what we were told in his campaign four years ago,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, the executive director for the California-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center. \"We were told that President Biden would be restoring humanity at our border...But what we are seeing is that history is repeating itself.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Senior administration officials separated themselves from the previous administration's approach, saying that their actions, among other things, were only temporary, only applied to those entering unlawfully, were not based on religion, and were, overall, far more humane.\n\nHe said that the measures could go into effect when the average daily encounters of migrants between ports of entry along the southern border exceeds 2,500 for seven consecutive days, and they will remain in effect until 14 calendar days after the average number of daily encounters dropped below 1,500 for seven consecutive days.\n\nHowever, significant exceptions to the restrictions still remain.\n\nThose include migrants who \"manifest or express a fear of return to their country\" or a fear of prosecution or torture being referred to a \"credible fear screening with an asylum officer\" and unaccompanied minors.\n\nThis new rule also does not apply to those who use one of the \"lawful pathways\" to come into the United States, such as the CHNV asylum program, which officials confirmed brings in 30,000 people a month, and the CBP One app, which accounts for 1,400 people per day.\n\nThe official also noted that \"The United States will continue to adhere to its international obligations and commitments by screening individuals who are found to be ineligible for asylum for withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture protection at a reasonable probability of persecution or torture standard.\"\n\nThese new measures will also apply to migrants from China and other nations beyond the Western hemisphere and expressed confidence in their ability to \"impose an immediate and fast consequence to migrants no matter what country they're coming from.\"\n\nThe executive order also comes after legislation failed to pass the House and the Senate that would have also ordered the suspension of asylum requests and the automatic denial of entrance to migrants once the daily crossings exceeded a certain number.\n\nSenior administration officials blasted congressional Republicans for failing to act.\n\n\"At that point in time, people understood that immigration shouldn't become a political football that we should put country over party,\" one senior administration official said. \"The reason we don't have the bipartisan bill today is very simple. Because the other administration, the prior administration's person, said, 'Don't do it. Don't give Joe Biden a victory.'\n\n\"That's not how we should run a country. And so that is unfortunate. An election year should not prohibit us from getting the people's work done.\"\n\nMr. Schmitt also said that the bill \"eviscerates [the] power of future presidents to secure [the] border by establishing a new MINIMUM number of illegal immigrants who must be admitted each day,\" and it would make \"invasion level migration permanent.\"\n\nPresident Biden ended several of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies on day one, including the \"stay in Mexico\" policy. Most migrants, including families, are then released into the United States while awaiting their asylum claim to be processed, which can take years. There are more than 2 million pending immigration court cases.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccompanied_minor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unaccompanied minor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Hemisphere"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/25/id5637538-GettyImages-2041445513-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 52, "textEnd": 58}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

There haven't been any final decisions regarding what additional executive actions, if any, could be taken,\" the official told AFP.\n\nRecord numbers of border crossings during the Democrat's time in office have put huge pressure on Biden as he trails in most polls behind Republican former president Trump.\n\nRepublicans have sought to make the border a key issue ahead of the November 5 vote, portraying Biden as soft on stopping what Trump calls an \"invasion\" of migration.\n\nMore than 2.4 million migrants crossed the southern US border in 2023 alone, largely from Central America and Venezuela as they flee poverty, violence and disasters exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\n- 'Broken' system -\n\nBiden's curbs would be some of the toughest brought in by any Democrat and would rely on the use of the same law that Trump's administration used to ban immigration from some Muslim countries.\n\nBut they would also almost certainly be challenged in court.\n\nThe White House blamed Republicans in Congress for blocking billions of dollars in funding for the border, which Biden tried to push through along with money for Ukraine and Israel.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"The administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\nTrump has meanwhile ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback despite a historic court verdict last week that made him the first former president to become a convicted felon.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and railed, without evidence, about migrants from \"insane asylums\" flooding into the United States.\n\ndk/bjt\n\nMore from this section\n\nCEOs got hefty pay raises in 2023, widening the gap with the workers

Under the rule, authorities would be able to then deport migrants who had crossed into the United States without proper documentation.\n\nGiven that illegal crossings are already often above that threshold, the freeze could be implemented at once, US media reported.

rhetoric as he seeks a White House comeback.\n\nHe has repeatedly spoken of migrants \"poisoning the blood\" of the United States and says he would enact the biggest deportation of migrants in history as soon as he takes office.\n\nBiden's administration has tried to curb crossings by working with Mexico and other countries to reduce migrant flows through enforcement and economic policies, but

They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.\n\nThe deterrent measures \"will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully,\" the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.\n\nKey operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive immigration policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally, a trend that has strained U.S. border authorities and cities receiving new arrivals. He is scheduled to speak at the White House at 2 p.m. EST.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nThe new restrictions resemble similar policies implemented by Trump and use a legal statute known as 212(f) that served as the underpinning for Trump's travel bans blocking people from several majority-Muslim nations and other countries.\n\nThe new restrictions are expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden for adopting Trump-like policies and backtracking on U.S. legal obligations to asylum seekers.\n\nIn advance of the announcement, Trump's campaign issued a statement criticizing Biden for high levels of illegal immigration and said the move to exempt unaccompanied minors would encourage child trafficking.\n\nINACTION IN CONGRESS\n\nBiden has pushed unsuccessfully for months to pass a Senate bill that would toughen border security, including with a provision that resembles his latest moves by executive action. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.\n\n\"Legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security and immigration reform,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo on Tuesday.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1. Biden's border restrictions could put pressure on Sheinbaum, the successor to current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to keep illegal border crossings down.\n\nLopez Obrador said at a daily press conference that he expected to speak with Biden over the phone as soon as Tuesday and that the countries \"have been making good progress\" on the issue of immigration.\n\nUnder the new measures, migrants who demonstrate a fear of being returned to their home countries will be screened for other types of humanitarian protection but could be deported if denied, the Biden official told reporters. Those who are removed will face at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\n\"These steps will strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate claims,\" the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a number of steps over the past year to toughen the asylum process, including issuing a regulation in May 2023 that heightened the standard for an initial asylum claim.\n\nBiden officials have said the effectiveness of U.S. enforcement is limited by a lack of resources in the absence of more funding from Congress.\n\n(Reporting by Ted Hesson in Washington and Mica Rosenberg in New York; Additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington and Raul Cortes in Mexico City; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

That will stay in effect until 14 days after there has been a seven-day average of less than 1,500 encounters along the border. Officials said it would make it easier for immigration officers to quickly remove individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain in the U.S.\n\nIn the last 24 hours at the border, sources tell Fox there were 5,200 encounters, and it has averaged over 5,000 every day for the past week. There were 179,725 encounters at the southern border in April, compared to 211,992 in April 2023, and 189,357 in March. While those numbers are lower than highs seen in 2022 and 2023, they still remain high compared to pre-2021 numbers.\n\nBIDEN EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE BORDER ACTIONS AS POLITICAL HEAT INTENSIFIES AHEAD OF NOVEMBER ELECTION\n\nIn doing so, Biden is drawing upon authorities under 212(f) and 215(a)of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which allows presidents to suspend entry of certain categories of foreign nationals. The Trump administration used 212 (f) on a number of occasions, including for the travel ban from certain countries, but it was blocked by a legal challenge from applying it to the southern border.\n\nThe order from President Biden includes a number of exceptions for those coming across the border. It will not apply to visa holders, unaccompanied children, victims of a \"severe form\" of trafficking, as well as those who face an acute medical emergency or an imminent threat to life or safety. It also does not apply to those seeking entry to the U.S. via ports of entry using the CBP One app -- of which around 1,500 migrants are allowed in each day.\n\nIt is expected to take place immediately, and will be accompanied by a joint rule restricting asylum eligibility during high border encounters that will be issued by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.\n\nIt marks a significant move toward the right from the Biden administration. In 2021 the administration rolled back a series of Trump-era border protections, which critics say encouraged the historic migrant numbers that followed. There have been over 7 million migrant crossings during Biden's time in office.\n\nThe administration says it is dealing with a hemisphere-wide challenge that needs congressional action to provide funding and fix what it says is a \"broken immigration system.\" The White House has said that this action comes now after Republicans have rejected other attempts at congressional actions, including a bipartisan Senate bill that would have implemented a similar limiting mechanism as well as providing additional funding.\n\n\"The presidential proclamation, together with the interim final rule, is another important step in our more than three years of ongoing efforts to strengthen our ability to impose consequences on those who cross our southern border,\" a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday ahead of the announcement.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY THE US-MEXICO BORDER IS A BIG PROBLEM\n\n\"But we are clear eyed that today's executive actions are no substitute for Congress taking up and passing the tough but fair bipartisan Senate bill, which would have significantly strengthened the consequences in place at the border and, equally important, have provided billions of dollars to support the men and women who are working on the front lines to secure our border,\" they said.\n\nWhile Republicans have previously urged the administration to use 212(f) to stop illegal crossings, ahead of the announcement lawmakers were unimpressed and called it a move that was too little, too late.\n\n\"By my count, he's issued 94 executive orders since he's been president for the United States. But he's waited until today to actually do what he calls effective action on the border,\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said at a press conference. \"And my question to him is, why did you wait until now if you were serious about doing it? The simple answer is he's not serious about securing the border.\"\n\nOther lawmakers claimed it was a cynical move just months out from an election in which Biden is struggling due to his handling of border security. A recent Fox News poll found that seven in 10 voters go so far as to say the White House has \"mostly failed\" at improving border security.\n\nMAYORKAS SAYS SOME MIGRANTS 'TRY TO GAME' ASYLUM SYSTEM, AS BORDER REMAINS TOP POLITICAL ISSUE\n\n\"It's a little late, you can't make this cat walk backwards,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who described Biden as \"polling right up there with fungal infections.\"\n\nThe move comes with Biden facing intense political pressure on the crisis from both the left and the right.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS\n\nMayors of cities like New York City, Denver and Chicago have demanded more funding from the federal government and have called for additional action, including expedited work permits. Recently, 15 House Democrats wrote to Biden calling on him to take additional action at the southern border.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It has become clear that the current situation remains untenable, but with Republicans playing politics on border security, it is time for your administration to act. We urge you to use all tools at your disposal, including executive action, to better address security at the Southern border, interdict illicit fentanyl and allow for orderly legal immigration,\" the letter said.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_shaw@foxnews.com", "name": "Adam Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_proclamation_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidential proclamation (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Order 13769"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccompanied_minor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unaccompanied minor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

According to senior administration officials, Biden's executive order will close the border once the rolling, seven-day average of migrant apprehensions exceeds 2,500 and will remain in effect until the rolling 14-day average falls below 1,500.\n\nRepublicans heartily criticized the president's order Tuesday, even before it was published.\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden is only pretending to secure the border because he's tanking in the polls,\" Trump's campaign wrote Tuesday morning. \"This crisis wasn't borne only from Biden's extreme weakness and incompetence, it was by design from the start.\"\n\n\"Now, Crooked Joe Biden is pretending to secure the border with a toothless executive order that allows thousands of unvetted illegal aliens to enter every day,\" the statement continues. \"If Biden cared about securing our border, he could have left in place the successful Trump border policies that resulted in the safest and most secure border in history. There's only one reason that Crooked Joe Biden is cosplaying with border security: his poll numbers are falling like a badly injured bird.\"\n\nJohnson claimed at his Tuesday press conference that Biden's order \"window dressing\" \"might make [the situation at the border] worse.\"\n\n\"If he was concerned about the border, he would have done this a long time ago, and we don't know what's in this. The devil will definitely be in the details here,\" he told reporters. \"It's absolute madness.\"\n\n\"There has been nearly 10 million illegal crossings in just over three years under Biden,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) added Tuesday morning. \"In the first three years of Trump, that number was 1.57 million illegal crossings. In the first three years of Obama, that number was 1.36 million illegal crossings. Why didn't Biden do this 10 million migrants ago?\"\n\n\"The Biden administration is planning to legalize at least 4,000 illegal border crossings per day -- no questions asked,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Jake Schneider predicted Monday night. \"In 2019, Obama-Biden DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said 1,000 illegal border crossings per day 'overwhelms the system. I cannot begin to imagine what 4,000/day looks like.' We don't have to imagine; under Crooked Joe Biden, it's an everyday reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, progressives also attacked the president for an apparent slide to the right on an emerging top issue for voters ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Semafor Monday night that she found Biden's order \"disappointing.\"\n\n\"[It] just plays into the idea that somehow harsh enforcement is going to work. That was Trump's approach,\" she claimed. \"We should be showing what the difference is.\"\n\nRep. Nanette Diaz Barragan (D-CA), the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, similarly told reporters Tuesday that she was \"disappointed\" in Biden for caving to the Right.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that this is a direction that the president has decided to take. We think it needs to be paired with positive actions and protections for undocumented folks that have been here for a long time,\" Barragan stated.\n\n\"You can build a wall as high as you want. You can make it hard to receive asylum if you want,\" Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) stated bluntly. \"It's not going to sustainably reduce the number of people wanting to come to the United States for a number of reasons until you identify and address root causes.\"\n\nInstead, Padilla argues that Biden should be touting the slow but steady decline in border apprehensions in recent months.\n\n\"The numbers are down because we've engaged with governmental leaders in Mexico,\" he claimed. \"That needs to continue and we need to build on that by engaging additional countries in the hemisphere. That is a way forward.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDespite Biden's order, senior administration officials reiterated to reporters that Congress must pass new immigration reform legislation to fully tackle border security.\n\n\"Everyone should be clear that all of the actions that I've just described cannot achieve the same result as the bipartisan security agreement that the congressional Republicans rejected,\" one senior administration official said. \"These actions do not provide additional critical personnel and funding or reforms needed to further secure our border. Congress still must act on that alternative.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A critical consideration was working with the administration of Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to get its cooperation on some key provisions, according to multiple officials familiar with the negotiations. On Sunday, Claudia Sheinbaum, whose candidacy was supported by L\u00f3pez Obrador, won election to succeed him as president.\n\nThe executive action is expected to rely on a presidential authority in the U.S. Code known as Section 212 (f), which would let the president unilaterally \"suspend the entry\" of specific groups of migrants whenever the number of attempted border crossings grows too high.\n\nA shutdown would not block trade, travel or entry by immigrants presenting themselves lawfully for asylum at ports of entry. But it would block migrants from applying for asylum if they crossed the border between ports of entry during the shutdown.\n\nDHS is also expected to redesignate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti, which would enable certain Haitian nationals who are in the U.S. to remain until conditions improve in Haiti, three of the sources said.\n\nThe country has been largely in control of armed gangs since March, and many lawmakers on Capitol Hill have urged the Biden administration to extend TPS to Haitians and halt deportations.\n\nIn recent days, the White House has reached out to mayors of border cities to attend the signing of the executive order, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nBorder politics have been a hot topic for months, with Senate Democrats' recent May effort to advance a bipartisan border security bill hitting a wall.\n\nIn February, senators released details of a bipartisan agreement that would have imposed tougher immigration and asylum laws and allowed Biden to \"shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed,\" the president explained in January remarks urging lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nBut just days later, Republican senators killed the bill their own party had negotiated with Democrats.\n\nBorder security appears to be a weak spot for Biden, according to polling. Former President Donald Trump has a 30-point edge with registered voters on the question of which candidate would handle immigration and border security better, including a 23-point edge among Latino voters, according to a late-March CNBC national poll.\n\nIf elected, Trump has vowed to launch the biggest \"domestic deportation operation\" in his second term. During his administration, Trump made it harder for foreign-born workers to enter the U.S., with visa denials rising by over 20% in both fiscal year 2018 and 2019 and refugee admissions decreasing.\n\nThere were 179,725 encounters along the southern border in April, a slight decrease from recent months, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Over 1.5 million encounters have been recorded this fiscal year to date, meaning fiscal year 2024 has so far outpaced fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 in encounters, according to the data.", "source":

They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.\n\nThe deterrent measures \"will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully,\" the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.\n\nKey operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive immigration policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally, a trend that has strained U.S. border authorities and cities receiving new arrivals. He is scheduled to speak at the White House at 2 p.m. EST.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nThe new restrictions resemble similar policies implemented by Trump and use a legal statute known as 212(f) that served as the underpinning for Trump's travel bans blocking people from several majority-Muslim nations and other countries.\n\nThe new restrictions are expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden for adopting Trump-like policies and backtracking on U.S. legal obligations to asylum seekers.\n\nIn advance of the announcement, Trump's campaign issued a statement criticizing Biden for high levels of illegal immigration and said the move to exempt unaccompanied minors would encourage child trafficking.\n\nINACTION IN CONGRESS\n\nBiden has pushed unsuccessfully for months to pass a Senate bill that would toughen border security, including with a provision that resembles his latest moves by executive action. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.\n\n\"Legislation is still the only way to permanently address border security and immigration reform,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo on Tuesday.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1. Biden's border restrictions could put pressure on Sheinbaum, the successor to current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to keep illegal border crossings down.\n\nLopez Obrador said at a daily press conference that he expected to speak with Biden over the phone as soon as Tuesday and that the countries \"have been making good progress\" on the issue of immigration.\n\nUnder the new measures, migrants who demonstrate a fear of being returned to their home countries will be screened for other types of humanitarian protection but could be deported if denied, the Biden official told reporters. Those who are removed will face at least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution.\n\n\"These steps will strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate claims,\" the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a number of steps over the past year to toughen the asylum process, including issuing a regulation in May 2023 that heightened the standard for an initial asylum claim.\n\nBiden officials have said the effectiveness of U.S. enforcement is limited by a lack of resources in the absence of more funding from Congress.

The action marks the administration's most dramatic move on the US southern border as Biden tries to gain the upper hand on immigration just weeks from the first presidential debate - by using the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office.\n\nThe authority will go into effect later on Tuesday, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe new executive action bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum - a departure from decades-long protocol - once a daily threshold is met. Unless they meet certain exemptions, migrants will be turned away to Mexico or returned to their origin country.\n\nBorder authorities encountered around 3,500 migrants crossing the border unlawfully on Monday, according to a Homeland Security official, above the threshold needed for the executive action to take effect.\n\nHomeland Security officials have recently been arresting just under 4,000 migrants daily at the US-Mexico border, a brief reprieve from record numbers late last year. The number of people crossing the US southern border has consistently been a challenge for the Biden administration as officials grapple with record migration across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe measure could be turned on and off. Senior administration officials told reporters Tuesday it would be lifted when there's a daily average of less than 1,500 encounters in between ports of entry.\n\nUnaccompanied children, victims of a severe form of trafficking, those who present an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life and safety - among select others - are exempt. Migrants can also still request an appointment through the Customs and Border Protection mobile application, known as CBP One, to present their asylum claim at a port of entry.\n\nCritics have blasted the move as akin to steps taken under Trump. As a candidate, Biden blasted the Trump administration as \"inhumane\" on the border. On a call with reporters Tuesday previewing the new action, one official defended the steps as separate and apart from Trump's, while acknowledging they're prepared for legal challenges, \"frankly, from both sides of the political spectrum.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system, and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,\" one official said Tuesday. \"The action will not ban people based on their religion, it will not separate kids from their mothers. There're also narrow humanitarian exceptions to the bar on asylum, including for those facing an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life or safety - the Trump administration's actions did not include these exceptions.\"\n\nSenior administration officials acknowledged that federal resources are strained, which could pose a challenge, but they maintain that the measure will help them remove people more quickly. Migrants who don't claim a fear may be removed within days or hours, while those that do will be screened and, if found ineligible, removed.\n\nHomeland Security officials have been preparing for an anticipated rise in border crossings, consistent with previous years when numbers tick up in the summer, including shifting resources to meet a potential surge and getting personnel in place. Senior administration officials Tuesday cited the measure as a tool to help head off that potential increase.\n\nStill, the official acknowledged, Tuesday's action \"cannot achieve the same result as a bipartisan security agreement that the congressional Republicans rejected.\"\n\n\"These actions do not provide the additional critical personnel and funding or reforms needed to further secure our border. Congress still must act,\" the official said.\n\nThe action also relies heavily on cooperation from Mexico, who previously agreed to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela as part of an effort to cut down on illegal migration in the hemisphere and has significantly ramped up immigration enforcement as part of ongoing efforts.\n\nOfficials declined to say Tuesday if any new agreement had been reached with Mexico around Tuesday's executive action.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If enacted, the border will only reopen when the daily figure drops to 1,500 cases.\n\nThe Biden Administration plans to maintain commercial trade through the border despite the executive order. This move would align the White House with policies that were part of a bipartisan border agreement in the Senate, which includes limiting asylum applications after a certain number of encounters.\n\nThe administration intends to encourage migrants to apply for asylum at designated ports of entry using the CBP One app by the Customs and Border Protection Office, which schedules approximately 1,450 appointments daily.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act grants the president the authority to block the entry of certain immigrants if deemed \"detrimental\" to national interests.

Some outlets reported that it could involve a mechanism to prevent additional migrant entries into the U.S. once there is a rolling seven-day average of a certain number of apprehensions a day.\n\nMAYORKAS SAYS SOME MIGRANTS 'TRY TO GAME' ASYLUM SYSTEM, AS BORDER REMAINS TOP POLITICAL ISSUE\n\nThat mechanism could echo a measure in a so-far thwarted bipartisan Senate bill that was unveiled earlier this year and has backing from the Biden administration but has so far failed to pick up enough support to pass in the upper chamber. In that bill, a Title-42 style expulsion authority would allow agents to quickly remove migrants across the border.\n\nBiden could attempt to implement an authority by executive order using 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows presidents to limit the entry of foreign nationals into the U.S.\n\nFormer President Trump used 212(f) multiple times during his presidency but was unsuccessful in using it to restrict border crossings, with a legal challenge scuttling the effort. Any similar move by President Biden would almost certainly face a similar challenge.\n\nCHINESE, JORDANIAN, TURKISH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAUGHT IN LARGE NUMBERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER\n\nThere were no plans for the president to visit the southern border ahead of his departure for Europe, officials told Fox.\n\nThe order comes amid a stalemate on the fiery topic of illegal immigration. In recent months, the numbers of migrant encounters has decreased from the record highs seen in December, where there were more than 200,000 migrant encounters.\n\nThere were 179,725 encounters at the southern border in April, compared to 211,992 in April 2023, and 189,357 in March. While those numbers are lower than highs seen in 2022 and 2023, they still remain high compared to pre-2021 numbers.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly said its hands are largely tied regarding fixing what it says is a \"broken\" immigration system and has repeatedly called for additional reforms and funding from Congress. In a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday, the White House said it \"continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\n\"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system. If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history. Instead, they put partisan politics ahead of our country's national security,\" a White House spokesperson said.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border.\"\n\nRepublicans, though, have blamed the policies of the administration, including the rollback of Trump-era policies such as wall construction, the Migrant Protection Protocols and increased interior enforcement. They have passed their own legislation in the House that would significantly limit asylum claims and restart border wall construction and similar measures. It has not yet been taken up by the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Fox News Sunday said the reported action from Biden is \"too little too late.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS\n\n\"Now he's trying to desperately show the American people somehow that he wants to address the issue that he himself created,\" he said.\n\n\"We documented 64 specific executive actions of President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas of DHS took over the course of the last three and a half years beginning on the first day that President Biden took office to open the border. Why? They did it intentionally. And it has had catastrophic effects upon our country that we'll be living with for decades to come,\" he said.\n\nThe administration continues to face pressure from Democratic states and cities, where large amounts of migrants have arrived. Mayors of cities like New York City, Denver and Chicago have demanded more funding from the federal government and have called for additional action, including expedited work permits. Recently, 15 House Democrats wrote to Biden calling on him to take additional action at the southern border.\n\n\"It has become clear that the current situation remains untenable, but with Republicans playing politics on border security, it is time for your administration to act. We urge you to use all tools at your disposal, including executive action, to better address security at the Southern border, interdict illicit fentanyl and allow for orderly legal immigration,\" the letter said.\n\nMeanwhile, the illegal immigration crisis appears to be looming as a major election issue. A recent Fox News poll found that seven in 10 voters go so far as to say the White House has \"mostly failed\" at improving border security.\n\nTrump won in 2016 due in large part to his plans to fix the southern border, an issue Biden's critics say he has failed to properly address.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut there has recently been more hawkish language from the administration on the crisis. Recently, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said some migrants attempt to \"game\" the system.\n\n\"The reality is that some people do indeed try to game the system,\" Mayorkas told CBS News last month. \"That does not speak to everyone whom we encounter, but there is an element of it, and we deal with it accordingly.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox

UrduPoint", "body": "Washington, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Jun, 2024) US President Joe Biden is expected to announce steps Tuesday to close the Mexican border to asylum seekers when numbers surge, in a bid to tackle a key weak spot in his election battle with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, 81, is set to sign a long-awaited executive order that would allow officials at certain times to deport migrants who cross the border illegally without processing their asylum claims first, US media reported.\n\nThe move would be one of the toughest ever by a Democratic president, and see him moving further towards Republican Trump's own signature border policies, amid polls showing the issue drags on Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nAn announcement is expected on Tuesday, sources close to the matter said, although the White House would not confirm reports that Biden will sign the executive order alongside mayors from border towns.\n\n\"What I can say is we are constantly and continuously looking at all options to try and really deal with the immigration system, a system that's been broken for decades,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nBiden's curbs on asylum requests would kick in when illegal crossings hit 2,500 a day, and would not lift until numbers drop back to 1,500, several US media outlets reported.\n\nThe figure rose to a record high of 10,000 a day in December and, while it has fallen dramatically in recent months, polls show the issue is one of Biden's biggest liabilities in the election.\n\nBiden's administration has tried to curb crossings by working with Mexico and other countries to reduce migrant flows through enforcement and economic policies, but many voters appear to think he took his eye off the ball.\n\nThe US president's announcement is due just a day after he spoke with Claudia Sheinbaum, who was elected Mexico's first woman president, to offer his congratulations and pledge a \"strong and collaborative partnership\".", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden",

Later in his term, Biden allowed for the expiration of the pandemic-era Title 42, which allowed authorities to quickly turn away migrants at the border on public health grounds.\n\nMembers of Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and centrist Democrats, urged Biden to use his executive authority to stem the tide of illegal immigration as well as stop an influx of fentanyl, human trafficking, and devastation of local communities.\n\nBiden had resisted pressure to take executive action, but is now poised to sign an order after the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected a bill -- for the second time -- that sought to tighten up the asylum process and shore up border security a couple of weeks ago.\n\nBorder security as well as immigration have become top issues for Americans as Biden is poised to once again face off against Trump in the presidential election that is coming up in November. Both men are their respective party's presumptive nominee in this year's contest.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nTrump's campaign website says he would \"shut down Biden's border disaster\" in a second term.

And, across the board, this coverage unanimously omitted one piece of major news.\n\nMost representative of this coverage was the CBS Evening News. Watch the full report, as aired on Monday, June 3rd, 2024 (click \"expand\" to view transcript):\n\nCBS EVENING NEWS\n\n6/3/24\n\n6:38 PM\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL: President Biden is under intense political pressure to curb illegal immigration. It's a top concern for voters, one that Donald Trump and his allies have seized on. And tomorrow Biden is expected to take action issuing a major executive order allowing him to partially shut down the asylum process at the southern border. CBS News was the first to break the story, and tonight our Nancy Cordes is at The White House. Nancy, good to see you. So I understand this is going to be the most restrictive border policy ever enacted by a Democratic president, why now?\n\nNANCY CORDES: Well, Norah, The White House had been hoping that Congress would take this step. It didn't. This represents a major change to immigration policy, and we're told that the president is going to sign this executive order tomorrow. CBS News has learned that this new order will allow U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants without processing their asylum claims any time the number of illegal border crossings tops a specific threshold, and sources tell CBS that threshold is likely to be 2500 migrant apprehensions a day. Which means this partial ban could be triggered on day one because the number of apprehensions at the southern border in May was higher than that. It was 3800 a day according to the Border Patrol. Right now, of course, asylum-seekers are allowed to stay in the U.S. until their case is processed, which can take years. And critics say that creates an incentive for those who don't qualify to come to the U.S. anyway. This new executive order is almost certainly going to face legal challenges down the road. The White House appears to be going this route now because Republicans rejected a bipartisan senate deal that would have done something similar. Norah.\n\nO'DONNELL: Nancy Cordes with that big news tonight. Thank you so much.\n\nYou have it all, really. CBS's report boils down to concerns over Biden's electoral prospects, and lamentations over the fact that Republicans didn't codify 4,999 illegal crossings into law- leaving Biden to use executive authority to try to fix the mess he made via executive authority when he ripped the border open on Day One.\n\nABC News followed a similar pattern:\n\nRACHEL SCOTT: Tonight, President Biden preparing to take his most aggressive action on immigration yet, with plans to issue an executive order to effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers when migrant crossings surge. Sources tell ABC News when daily encounters reach 2,500 between ports of entry, asylum seekers would be turned away. The move could have an immediate impact. Migrant crossings have averaged 3,500 a day in recent weeks. The president, keenly aware that immigration is a top issue for voters, has been weighing how he can act alone, after Donald Trump urged Republicans to block a bipartisan deal their own party negotiated.\n\nProtect the Precious at all times, in and out of season.\n\nNBC took a significantly different approach in that Telemundo anchor Julio Vaqueiro steered away from domestic political implications and covered the likely meltdown to come from the Immigration-Industrial Complex:\n\nLINDSAY TOCZYLOWSKI: This really what sounds like a draconian and potentially unlawful immigration shutdown of the border.\n\nVaqueiro closed out his coverage by exposing a major loophole in the executive order: The unaccompanied minors exception.\n\nVAQUEIRO: Today President Biden spoke with Mexico's president-elect. As for tomorrow's executive action, it's expected to include some exceptions,humanitarian exceptions including one for unaccompanied children.\n\nThat exception becomes increasingly relevant when taking notice of the related news item suppressed across the dial: the Biden administration's decision to kill 350,000 asylum cases- effectively, a mass amnesty.\n\nAs reported by the indispensable Jennie Taer over at The New York Post:\n\nWhile the Biden administration is attempting to look like it's getting tough on the border, behind the scenes it's operating a program of \"mass amnesty\" for migrants, The Post can reveal.\n\nData show that since 2022, more than 350,000 asylum cases filed by migrants have been closed by the US government if the applicants don't have a criminal record or are otherwise not deemed a threat to the country.\n\nThis means that while the migrants are not granted or denied asylum -- their cases are \"terminated without a decision on the merits of their asylum claim\" -- they are removed from the legal system and no longer required to check in with authorities.\n\nThe move allows them to legally, indefinitely roam the US without fear of deportation, effectively letting them slip through the cracks.\n\nThat's kind of a super important point to cover when reporting on matters pertaining to immigration and the border. But, as always, the Regime Media's focus is to Protect the Precious and to cast President Biden as the purest, truest victim of any of a wide assortment of (often self-induced) calamities.\n\nSORR OF UNRELATED NOTE BUT NOT REALLY: It was refreshing to watch folks actually SPEAKING ENGLISH on a network newscast (as did Telemundo anchor Julio Vaqueiro for NBC and TelevisaUnivision anchor Enrique Acevedo for CBS during their respective coverages of the election of Claudia Sheinbaum as the next president of Mexico), as opposed to the weird, verby Newspeak so prevalent today.\n\nClick \"expand\" to view the full transcripts of the aforementioned reports as aired on their respective newscasts on Monday, June 3rd, 2024:\n\nABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT\n\nABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT\n\n6/3/24\n\n6:35 PM\n\nDAVID MUIR: Meanwhile, there is a developing headline tonight involving the U.S./Mexico border. This evening, sources now say President Biden is preparing to take tough executive action on immigration, including shutting the border when the number of asylum seekers reaches 2,500. It would trigger an immediate shutdown. It comes tonight as the new president of Mexico, their first woman president, a physicist and engineer, has already signaled she will work with the U.S. on immigration. Rachel Scott at the White House.\n\nRACHEL SCOTT: Tonight, President Biden preparing to take his most aggressive action on immigration yet, with plans to issue an executive order to effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers when migrant crossings surge. Sources tell ABC News when daily encounters reach 2,500 between ports of entry, asylum seekers would be turned away. The move could have an immediate impact. Migrant crossings have averaged 3,500 a day in recent weeks. The president, keenly aware that immigration is a top issue for voters, has been weighing how he can act alone, after Donald Trump urged Republicans to block a bipartisan deal their own party negotiated.\n\nJOE BIDEN: There's no guarantee that I have that power all by myself without legislation. And some have suggested I should just go ahead and try it.\n\nSCOTT: The U.S. has seen a record 6.4 million illegal border crossings during the Biden administration. Officials say the numbers have dipped in recent months, because Mexico is cracking down on their side of the border. And the U.S. will soon have a new partner. Mexico tonight electing its first woman and first Jewish president, Claudia Sheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City, a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering who won the Nobel Peace Prize. Sheinbaum is vowing to continue the policies of outgoing president Lopez Obrador working to control the flow of migrants. And David, and back to that executive order, this could have an immediate impact for those who are seeking asylum. The number of migrant encounters at the border already far exceeds that threshold. The White House and the Biden administration fully aware this will likely be challenged in court. David.\n\nMUIR: Rachel Scott with a developing headline from The White House tonight.

According to senior administration officials, Biden's executive order will close the border once the rolling, seven-day average of migrant apprehensions exceeds 2,500 and will remain in effect until the rolling 14-day average falls below 1,500.\n\nRepublicans heartily criticized the president's order Tuesday, even before it was published.\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden is only pretending to secure the border because he's tanking in the polls,\" Trump's campaign wrote Tuesday morning. \"This crisis wasn't borne only from Biden's extreme weakness and incompetence, it was by design from the start.\"\n\n\"Now, Crooked Joe Biden is pretending to secure the border with a toothless executive order that allows thousands of unvetted illegal aliens to enter every day,\" the statement continues. \"If Biden cared about securing our border, he could have left in place the successful Trump border policies that resulted in the safest and most secure border in history. There's only one reason that Crooked Joe Biden is cosplaying with border security: his poll numbers are falling like a badly injured bird.\"\n\nJohnson claimed at his Tuesday press conference that Biden's order \"window dressing\" \"might make [the situation at the border] worse.\"\n\n\"If he was concerned about the border, he would have done this a long time ago, and we don't know what's in this. The devil will definitely be in the details here,\" he told reporters. \"It's absolute madness.\"\n\n\"There has been nearly 10 million illegal crossings in just over three years under Biden,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) added Tuesday morning. \"In the first three years of Trump, that number was 1.57 million illegal crossings. In the first three years of Obama, that number was 1.36 million illegal crossings. Why didn't Biden do this 10 million migrants ago?\"\n\n\"The Biden administration is planning to legalize at least 4,000 illegal border crossings per day -- no questions asked,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Jake Schneider predicted Monday night. \"In 2019, Obama-Biden DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said 1,000 illegal border crossings per day 'overwhelms the system. I cannot begin to imagine what 4,000/day looks like.' We don't have to imagine; under Crooked Joe Biden, it's an everyday reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, progressives also attacked the president for an apparent slide to the right on an emerging top issue for voters ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Semafor Monday night that she found Biden's order \"disappointing.\"\n\n\"[It] just plays into the idea that somehow harsh enforcement is going to work. That was Trump's approach,\" she claimed. \"We should be showing what the difference is.\"\n\nRep. Nanette Diaz Barragan (D-CA), the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, similarly told reporters Tuesday that she was \"disappointed\" in Biden for caving to the Right.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that this is a direction that the president has decided to take. We think it needs to be paired with positive actions and protections for undocumented folks that have been here for a long time,\" Barragan stated.\n\n\"You can build a wall as high as you want. You can make it hard to receive asylum if you want,\" Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) stated bluntly. \"It's not going to sustainably reduce the number of people wanting to come to the United States for a number of reasons until you identify and address root causes.\"\n\nInstead, Padilla argues that Biden should be touting the slow but steady decline in border apprehensions in recent months.\n\n\"The numbers are down because we've engaged with governmental leaders in Mexico,\" he claimed. \"That needs to continue and we need to build on that by engaging additional countries in the hemisphere. That is a way forward.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDespite Biden's order, senior administration officials reiterated to reporters that Congress must pass new immigration reform legislation to fully tackle border security.\n\n\"Everyone should be clear that all of the actions that I've just described cannot achieve the same result as the bipartisan security agreement that the congressional Republicans rejected,\" one senior administration official said. \"These actions do not provide additional critical personnel and funding or reforms needed to further secure our border. Congress still must act on that alternative.\"\n\nRachel Schilke contributed to this report.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Here's What To Know", "body": "President Joe Biden issued a presidential proclamation Tuesday that will limit the number of asylum-seekers allowed to enter the country if border crossings reach a certain threshold -- action that hinges on a law former President Donald Trump used to implement his controversial ban on entrants of Muslim-majority countries.\n\n128,900. That's the number of migrant encounters Customs and Border Protection recorded in April at the southwest border, a 6% decline from March and 30% drop from April 2023, according to CBP.\n\nFormer Department of Homeland Security officials warned previously that drastically curtailing border crossings could crowd portions of the southern border and would only be possible with Mexico's cooperation, they told NBC in January when Biden urged Congress to give him the authority to \"shut down the border.\"\n\nThe long-awaited executive action comes as border crossings have reached record highs under Biden and as Congress has failed to pass legislation that would address the surge -- a key issue in the 2024 election. Many people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border claim asylum in the United States, a legal avenue for people who fear persecution in their home country, but the jump in border crossings has caused severe backlogs in immigration court, leading some asylum-seekers to wait years for their cases to be heard. The executive order would mark Biden's most significant immigration policy since he took office and comes after Trump effectively killed bipartisan border legislation tied to aid to Ukraine that was working its way through the Senate earlier this year and closely resembled the order announced Tuesday. Trump argued the legislation would be a political \"gift\" to Democrats in an election year -- when polls show voters consistently say it's a key issue in the 2024 election, including in an April Gallup survey that found a plurality of voters, 27%, rated it as the most important problem facing the country for the third consecutive month, above the economy and inflation.\n\n\"Let's be clear -- Joe Biden's Executive Order is for amnesty, not border security,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday ahead of the announcement. \"This new order will facilitate the release of more illegals as quickly as possible with a smartphone app,\" Leavitt said, referring to the process for scheduling asylum appointment.\n\nWhy Biden Can't Easily 'Shut Down The Border'

Some outlets reported that it could involve a mechanism to prevent additional migrant entries into the U.S. once there is a rolling seven-day average of more than 4,000 apprehensions a day.\n\nMAYORKAS SAYS SOME MIGRANTS 'TRY TO GAME' ASYLUM SYSTEM, AS BORDER REMAINS TOP POLITICAL ISSUE\n\nThat mechanism would likely be similar to one proposed in a sweeping bipartisan Senate bill that was unveiled earlier this year and has backing from the Biden administration but has so far failed to drum up enough support to pass in the upper chamber. In that bill, a Title-42 style expulsion authority would allow agents to quickly remove migrants across the border.\n\nBiden could attempt to implement an authority by executive order using 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows presidents to limit the entry of foreign nationals into the U.S.\n\nFormer President Trump used 212(f) multiple times during his presidency but was unsuccessful in using it to restrict border crossings, with a legal challenge scuppering the effort. Any similar move by President Biden would almost certainly face a similar challenge.\n\nCHINESE, JORDANIAN, TURKISH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAUGHT IN LARGE NUMBERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER\n\nThere are no plans for the president to visit the southern border next week ahead of his departure for Europe, officials say.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly said its hands are largely tied regarding fixing what it says is a \"broken\" immigration system and has repeatedly called for additional reforms and funding from Congress. In a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday, the White House said it \"continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\"\n\n\"Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America's broken immigration system. If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history. Instead, they put partisan politics ahead of our country's national security,\" a White House spokesperson said.\n\n\"While Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border.\"\n\nRepublicans have blamed the policies of the administration, including the rollback of Trump-era policies such as wall construction, the Migrant Protection Protocols and increased interior enforcement. They have passed their own legislation in the House that would significantly limit asylum claims and restart border wall construction and similar measures. It has not yet been taken up by the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Fox News Sunday said that the reported action from Biden is \"too little too late.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS\n\n\"Now he's trying to desperately show the American people somehow that he wants to address the issue that he himself created,\" he said.\n\n\"We documented 64 specific executive actions of President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas of DHS took over the course of the last three and a half years beginning on the first day that President Biden took office to open the border. Why? They did it intentionally. And it is had catastrophic effects upon our country that we'll be living with for decades to come,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the illegal immigration crisis appears to be looming as a major election issue. A recent Fox News poll said the crisis at the southern border is the second most important issue for voters and 69% of respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the border.\n\nTrump won in 2016 due in large part to his plans to fix the southern border, an issue Biden's critics say he has failed to properly address.\n\nHowever, in recent months the numbers of migrant encounters has decreased from the record highs seen in December, where there were more than 200,000 migrant encounters.\n\nThere were 179,725 encounters at the southern border in April, compared to 211,992 in April 2023, and 189,357 in March.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, the administration has been using tougher rhetoric on the crisis. Recently, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that some migrants attempt to \"game\" the system.\n\n\"The reality is that some people do indeed try to game the system,\" Mayorkas told CBS News last month. \"That does not speak to everyone whom we encounter, but there is an element of it, and we deal with it accordingly.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"},

Sinema speaks to U.S. Senate after nearly all Republicans, and a few Democrats, voted against the Bipartisan Border Security Agreement, 50-43.\n\nAfter watching illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border explode throughout his presidency, President Joe Biden has finally decided it's time to act.\n\nNearly four years into his term, it feels more than a little late. Apparently, Biden can no longer ignore the polls.\n\nBiden has hemmed and hawed for years that he's helpless to slow down border encounters that have more than doubled during his tenure and that he's reliant on Congress to help out.\n\nThat was always untrue. In his first days in office, after all, Biden used his executive authority to end Trump administration policies like \"Remain in Mexico\" that were helpful in curbing asylum claims that have overwhelmed our border.\n\nBiden simply chose to ignore the problem. Plus, he didn't want to pick fights with progressives in his party who'd rather there not be any limits on the border.\n\nThat strategy has backfired spectacularly. Biden's tanking poll numbers are due in no small part to his mismanagement of illegal immigration.\n\nBorder chaos: Trump and Biden keep blaming each other. But voters want solutions, not chaos at border.\n\nImmigration, along with the economy and inflation, has soared to one of the top issues on voters' minds as we head toward the presidential election. It's not just a border problem anymore, as cities - often large, Democratic ones like Chicago and New York - are dealing with an influx of migrants.\n\nIt's no surprise that voters trust former President Donald Trump over Biden by double digits on these issues: Trump has a 17-point lead on immigration and a 14-point lead on the economy and inflation, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll from last month.\n\nAn executive order with power to shut down border\n\nBiden reportedly plans to sign the executive order Tuesday, in the presence of several mayors from South Texas.\n\nThe order will more strictly cap the number of illegal crossings. If the number of crossings average 2,500 a day, then border officials would be able to quickly expel migrants without a chance for asylum.\n\nTrump convicted: Trump is guilty. It won't matter at all this election.\n\nWhile numbers have fallen since late last year, they have remained high. In December, there was an all-time monthly record of migrant encounters - 250,000 - crossing into the United States from Mexico.\n\nIn the first three weeks of May, the U.S. Border Patrol reported a daily average of 3,700 apprehensions of migrants, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.\n\nSo Biden's new order will have immediate consequences if these numbers remain high.\n\nCould Hunter Biden's trial have played into timing?\n\nIn addition to all the surveys showing Americans don't trust Biden to handle the border crisis, there could be something else that nudged the president to take action this week.\n\nTrump, who was convicted in his hush money trial Thursday, isn't the only one in the hot seat. Biden's son Hunter is in court in Wilmington, Delaware, as his felony gun trial begins. The younger Biden is charged with lying on a federal gun form in 2018 about his drug addiction. A jury was selected on Monday.\n\nSeparately, he faces three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors in a California federal court after he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes, instead spending the money \"on drugs, escorts and girlfriends.\"\n\nDe Niro's Trump rant: Hate to break it to you, Joe. Robert De Niro's Trump rant won't win Biden more fans.\n\nAll of this is bad enough, not to mention the attention Republicans in Congress have brought to Hunter Biden's shady business deals.\n\nIn other words, it's embarrassing for the president, who's trying to write off all his son's bad behavior as a result of his addiction.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThat may be. But these aren't the kind of headlines that will buoy a floundering reelection campaign.\n\nSo why not try to change the conversation with an executive order on immigration?\n\nBiden's now taking the right action. He just shouldn't have waited nearly four years to do it.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Progressives have decried Biden's actions as draconian, saying it will worsen a humanitarian crisis without addressing the root causes of migration, while moderates and swing-state lawmakers are pressing the administration to slow the flow of migrants, who are straining resources in cities across the country.\n\nAhead of Biden's announcement, Representative , the Democratic chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called the plans \"very disappointing,\" adding \"it does not solve the problem at the border.\"\n\nRepublicans have cast the proposals as too little, too late.\n\nBiden will deliver remarks about his actions at the White House at 2 p.m. New York time on Tuesday.\n\nHis changes will shut down asylum claims for people who cross between ports of entry when crossing levels are above 2,500 border encounters per day. Border crossings were already well above that metric in April, when US authorities recorded about 4,300 encounters per day with undocumented migrants between ports of entry. The restrictions will lift only once they are under 1,500 per day for at least a week.\n\nThe rule makes three key changes to processing under so-called Title 8 authorities, according to officials. The first is that border crossers become generally ineligible for asylum when levels are above the threshold, with some exceptions, such as for unaccompanied minors. Secondly, not all claimants will be referred for a credible fear screening, a lower threshold for granting asylum in which an officer determines if a person has a fear of being harmed if returned home. And finally, the US will raise its threshold for those ineligible for asylum but who claim a fear of return, applying a more difficult test for them.\n\nEarlier: Biden to Crack Down on Migrants by Slashing Asylum Claims-bsp-bb-link>\n\nThe changes apply to all non-citizens. Exceptions include people with visas that allow them to enter the US and cases of medical emergency, the officials said.\n\nAsylum claims are also still permitted by those who make appointments through the CBP One app and then arrive at a port of entry. Those cases do not count against the cap.\n\nPeople will be removed in some cases within hours or days, officials said, though they acknowledged it depends on their home country. The US already conducts repatriation flights to some countries including India, according to US officials. Mexican nationals, as well as those from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, will be returned to Mexico, as was previously the case, the officials said.\n\nDemocratic efforts to revive a bipartisan immigration deal killed by Trump failed, leading Biden to act now ahead of the summer when border crossings typically rise, the US officials said.\n\nBiden risks anger from members of his own party, including Hispanic lawmakers who say he should provide more help to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"There will be a lot of people who will be disappointed he is moving in this direction,\" Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair said. \"It needs to be paired with positive actions.\"\n\nOther Democrats defended Biden's move, with Representative , leader of the moderate New Democrat Coalition, saying it would \"100%\" help Biden in swing districts and that her group supports his actions. The coalition also wants to expand work visas for immigrants.\n\nBiden's actions, though, are unlikely to neutralize the issue for Republicans.\n\n\"It's just window dressing,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said, adding the order will not reduce chaos at the border.\n\nBiden's changes face a raft of obstacles both in court and on the ground. Immigrant-rights advocates are likely to sue the administration for limiting asylum access, as they did when then-President Trump rolled out a similar policy under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act called 212(f).\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union-bsp-bb-link> lawyer Lee Gelernt-bsp-person>, who led previous challenges, is reviewing the action but said \"any policy that effectively cuts off protection for desperate migrants would raise serious legal problems.\"\n\nSenior officials said they're prepared for litigation and sought to distinguish the new policy from Trump's by noting exceptions for unaccompanied children, victims of severe trafficking and other vulnerable migrants.\n\nEarlier: Biden, Border Crisis Loom Large in Sheinbaum's Early Hours-bsp-bb-link>\n\nThe policy's success will also depend on diplomacy and funding. The US must persuade Mexico to accept more migrants and get countries such as China and Venezuela to accept more deportation flights of citizens. US officials are working to expand that coordination, a senior official said Tuesday.\n\nFast processing and deportations are contingent on sufficient resources from Congress, which has repeatedly rebuffed the administration's requests for supplemental border funds.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

EPA-Yonhap\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign a sweeping new border measure on Tuesday that would allow authorities to quickly deport or send back to Mexico migrants caught crossing the southwest border if illegal entries surpass a certain level, according to two sources with knowledge of the move.\n\nThe measure, which would restrict access to asylum, would take effect when U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions surpass 2,500 per day, the two sources said. The illegal crossings would have to dip below 1,500 per day for the asylum restrictions to be lifted, one of the sources said.\n\nThe restrictions are not expected to apply to unaccompanied minors. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe election-year move is expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden, a Democrat, for adopting hardline policies that mirror those of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for voting-age Americans in the run-up to Nov. 5 elections where he will face Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally. Trump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nIn advance of the announcement, Trump's campaign issued a statement calling Biden's executive order \"amnesty, not border security\" and again blaming immigrants for what he called a U.S. crime wave.\n\nA range of studies by academics and think tanks have shown that immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born Americans.\n\nTrump himself became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime on Thursday when a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe new U.S. restrictions mirror a Biden-backed Senate bill that aimed to block migrants from claiming asylum if the number of migrants caught crossing illegally reached a certain level. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1.

Former President Donald Trump relied on the same section of the immigration act when he introduced restrictions during his presidency.\n\n\"As we have said before, the Administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system,\" a spokesperson for the White House said in a statement.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus asked Biden not to use the same section of the act to carry out his order during a late May meeting at the White House.\n\nNews of the Biden administration's latest order comes just 24 hours after Mexico's historic election.\n\nMexicans voted overwhelmingly for Claudia Sheinbaum, giving her more than 58% of the vote to govern the No. 1 trading partner for the United States. Despite deep cross-border economic ties, the U.S.-Mexico relationship has been tested for years by the countries' shared problems with immigration and drug trafficking.\n\nMore: Mexico has a new president, Claudia Sheinbaum. What does it mean for the United States?\n\nEarlier this year, a bipartisan deal collapsed in the Senate that would have allowed for the automatic restriction on asylum-seekers when the number of crossings reached a certain threshold. That bill set the conditions for asylum restrictions at an average of 4,000 migrants per day in a given week, including at ports of entry, with a mandatory shutdown at 5,000 migrants per day on average.\n\nUnauthorized migration at the U.S. border exploded after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Biden administration has been working to contain crossings ever since with uneven results.\n\nThe executive order addresses one aspect of migration: asylum-seekers who, rather than sneaking over the border, cross and turn themselves in to border agents.\n\n\"The Biden administration's reported plan to cap asylum requests is a violation of U.S. refugee law and the Refugee Convention,\" said Marisa Lim\u00f3n Garza, executive director of the El Paso, Texas-based Las Americas Immigrant Rights Center.\n\n\"Our country has a well-established procedure for reviewing and vetting asylum claims,\" she said. \"Refusing to use this process renders women, children, and families fleeing violence more vulnerable to those who would prey upon them.\"\n\nDavid Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized Biden's proposal as unworkable.\n\n\"Since FY 2019, there has been one month outside of FY 2020 where arrests fell below 1,500 per day,\" Bier said in a post on X. \"This is a ludicrous proposal.\"\n\nU.S. laws are contradictory. Crossing between ports of entry is illegal under Title 8, but under the same U.S. code migrants still retain the right to seek asylum under even if they do.\n\nAnd despite Biden's creation of new lawful pathways, asylum-seekers have continued to try their luck between ports of entry.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol encounters and apprehensions peaked above 2.4 million in fiscal year 2023 - an all-time

Henry Cuellar backed the executive action, even though he hadn't yet read it.\n\nI've been briefed on the pending executive order. I certainly support it because I've been advocating for these measures for years. While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far.\n\nCuellar has previously criticized Biden for not bolstering enforcement at the border earlier in his presidency.\n\nAngelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, a White House spokesman, said in a statement on Monday:\n\nWhile congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border.\n\n[The administration is was exploring] a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\n\nHere's more, via The Times:\n\nThe order would allow border officials to prevent migrants from claiming asylum and rapidly turn them away once border crossings exceed a certain threshold. Government officials earlier this year discussed allowing Mr. Biden to shut down the border if there were an average of 5,000 border crossings in a week, or 8,500 in a single day, but those involved in the negotiations cautioned that the threshold was not finalized and could change. White House officials have been focused on a trigger that would empower Mr. Biden to shut down the border.\n\nEmbattled serial-lying Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who never fails to deliver (to those who think he should impeached, convicted, and promptly thrown into prison for treason), predictably said in May:\n\nLegislation is what is needed. Executive action will be challenged. I am confident in that. And then the question will be what is the outcome of those proceedings? Legislation is a more certain delivery of solution.\n\nAnd why does arguably the worst president in U.S. history need congressional action to stop what it intentionally started shortly after Biden took office?\n\nEven worse, Biden said the following about former President Trump in 2019 about Trump's \"Return to Mexico\" policy.\n\nThis is the first president in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before.\n\nYou come to the United States and you make your case. That's how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.\n\nThe shameless hypocrisy of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. knows no bounds. There is no depth to which this guy, his handlers, and the Democrat Party won't sink.\n\nSo what changed? Why the 360? The answer is not only simple; it's obvious.\n\nBiden's handlers are desperately trying to salvage his miserable dumpster fire of a presidency by pulling out every stop they think might help.\n\nBut here's the other thing:\n\nIf Biden does take the executive action and wins in November -- then actually follows through with the EO -- how many nanoseconds will it take him to rip it into shreds and go right back to importing as many illegal aliens as he can get away with in a second term?\n\nRelated:\n\nOUTRAGE: Sources Say Biden Administration Has Granted De Facto Amnesty to 350K Illegal

There are some humanitarian exceptions, including for unaccompanied children, victims of trafficking, an acute medical emergency or an imminent threat to life or safety.\n\nThe rule will go into effect later Tuesday. Daily encounters are higher than the 2,500 figure, so it could be implemented as soon as it's signed.\n\nA senior administration official said that the goal of Biden's actions is to \"significantly increase consequences for for those who cross the southern border unlawfully, without authorization.\"\n\nBiden will unveil the action at the White House on Tuesday afternoon joined by mayors and governors from across the country, including two Texas border mayors: Brownsville Mayor John Cowen and Edinburg Mayor Ramiro Garza. The White House hailed the fact that \"most\" of the guests at Tuesday's event are from border communities.\n\n\"They're working on these issues day in and day out, and, like the president, they want balanced solutions,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nIt's the most restrictive immigration policy put into place by any modern Democratic president, and Biden's first major step to address border security since Republicans killed a bipartisan border security compromise earlier this year. The White House took the opportunity to hammer the GOP for scuttling the bipartisan agreement -- negotiated by Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a Republican, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat, and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent -- earlier this year at the urging of House Republicans and former President Donald Trump.\n\nA senior administration official charged that Republicans killed the compromise because they \"would rather weaponize problems than fix them.\"\n\n\"Congressional Republicans had an opportunity to support the fairest and toughest set of reforms in decades, and they chose to put partisan political interests ahead of fixing our immigration system and securing our borders,\" the official said.\n\n\"Fortunately, across the country, there are elected officials, Republicans, Democrats and independents, who share President Biden's strongly held belief that we must have smart, balanced approaches to immigration,\" they added.\n\nThe action will no doubt face legal challenges, but an administration official said that they \"look forward\" to defending the rule.\n\nThe move was met with some support from Biden's own party, particularly from those who backed the bipartisan border bill killed by Republicans.\n\n\"It's important that the president is planning to take decisive action given the fact that extreme MAGA Republicans have decided to try to weaponize the challenges at the border,\" said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at a press conference Tuesday morning.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., chided his Republican colleagues for not taking action to enact legislation to address the border, saying that it \"would have been the more effective way to go.\"\n\nSchumer went on to say that Biden preferred to take the legislative route to address immigration, but: \"given how obstinate Republicans have become, turning down any real opportunity for strong border legislation, the president is left with little choice but to act on his own.\"\n\nBut progressive Democrats and Republicans alike decried the action -- though for wildly different reasons.\n\nPrior to the announcement on Tuesday, Trump's campaign panned Biden's plan as \"mass amnesty to destroy America.\"\n\n\"If Joe Biden truly wanted to shut down the border, he could do so with a swipe of the same pen, but he never will because he is controlled by radical left Democrats who seek to destroy America,\" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Senate GOP leadership, questioned the timing of why Biden waited to unveil the order before responding to his own query by charging: \"The simple answer is he's not serious.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson expressed a similar sentiment, calling Biden's action \"window dressing\" while charging that the president and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who his chamber impeached earlier this year, \"engineered\" a border crisis.\n\n\"If he was concerned about the border, he would have done this a long time ago,\" Johnson said, while acknowledging that he had not yet seen the president's order. \"The devil will definitely be in the details here, I can assure you.\"\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called Biden's actions \"extremely disappointing.\"\n\n\"Democrats cannot buy into cruel enforcement-only measures that have failed for 30 years,\" she wrote on social media ahead of the announcement. \"We need real, humane reform that expands legal pathways.\"\n\n\"I'm disappointed that this is a direction that the President has decided to take,\" California Rep. Nanette Barragan, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told reporters on Tuesday. \"We think it needs to be paired with positive actions and protections for undocumented folks that have

In the face of this, President Biden will announce executive actions to foreign migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe joint order to be issued by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department will shut down the Southwest border between legal ports of entry when illegal crossings exceed 2,500 for several days, and won't reopen it until the average number of crossings drops below 1,500.\n\nThis also applies to southern coastal border areas, officials said.\n\nBecause of current levels of irregular immigration, the order will go into effect \"immediately\" after Biden makes the announcement today, a senior official told media.\n\n\"Today, the administration is taking decisive action designed to strengthen the security of our southern border and reduce unlawful migration,\" an official said. \"It will make it easier for immigration officials to remove those who are here unlawfully and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents.\"\n\nThe change in asylum policies comes just five months before the presidential election and after repeated failures by lawmakers to pass the Senate Border Bill, which Biden has been touting since he visited South Texas on Feb. 29. The failed bill would have also allowed the closure of the border when numbers exceeded a certain amount. The bill also calls for hiring 100 additional immigration judges and thousands of additional asylum officers and Border Patrol agents.\n\nTuesday's announcement is a joint order and the border won't be reopened until 14 days after it has been determined that the daily average of border encounters between ports of entry has dropped below 1,500 for seven consecutive days, an official said.\n\n\"These measures will significantly increase the speed and the scope of consequences for those who cross unlawfully or without authorization and allow the departments to more quickly remove individuals who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States,\" an official said.\n\nUnaccompanied minors who cross the border will be exempt from immediate deportation.\n\nCredible fear screenings will continue to be conducted for those who believe they meet the qualifications, and those who can prove they have an \"imminent and extreme threat to life and safety\" will be allowed to stay in the United States, an official said.\n\n\"Individuals who do not manifest a fear will be immediately removable, and we anticipate that we will be removing those individuals in a matter of days, if not hours,\" an official said. \"Individuals who do not manifest a fear will be processed as we always do under our Title 8 authorities through the expedited removal process.\"\n\nOther exceptions also apply including:\n\nAsylum-seekers who have scheduled asylum appointments with the CBP One app will be allowed to cross at U.S. ports of entry for their meetings. U.S. Customs and Border Protection currently allows 1,400 daily asylum interviews scheduled via the app.\n\nBut those who cross the Rio Grande and do not enter at regulated CBP facilities will face immediate deportation to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nThis includes Chinese nationals, and administration officials say the United States has made strides with other countries to accept and repatriate their citizens, including India, Senegal and Uzbekistan.\n\nIt was not clear if Mexico has signed on to accept deportations, nor how many. There were repeated questions as to Mexico's cooperation in this plan but no specifics were given.", "source": {"uri": "ksn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At least Sens. Jon Tester of Montana; Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin; Jacky Rosen of Nevada; and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania -- all of whom are seeking reelection in battleground states -- will not attend, per Axios.\n\nProgressives warn against asylum crackdown\n\nJennie Murray, president and CEO of the nonpartisan immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Forum, told NewsNation her organization doesn't support executive orders and that she believes a cap on asylum-seekers would only be a \"Band-Aid\" on the problem.\n\n\"We don't need to see anything else being compounded down there, and an executive order. While it looks on the surface as if it would be a solution, it will compound the issue, we will have more of the asylum seekers, you know, backed up.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told \"The Hill Sunday\" that the executive order needs to include limiting and banning migrants from crossing the border illegally.\n\n\"The devil is always in the details. Like that Senate bill that came through, there were a lot of great ideas. But for every good idea, there was a loophole on the next page that basically meant nothing. So, I would want to make sure that we're building the wall, that we are limiting and banning these people from coming across the border illegally,\" she said.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to give the Biden administration credit for acting on the U.S. border as they work to clamp down on illegal immigration. He said the bill is \"too little too late now\" on \"Fox News Sunday.\"", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That was Trump's approach. We should be showing what the difference is.\"\n\nThe order is expected to let officials deny new asylum claims by migrants if daily border crossings reach 2,500 a day or higher, well below the average rate of 4,300 per day in April, the latest month that data is publicly available. The rules, which mirror a proposal from the bipartisan border deal that collapsed in Congress earlier this year, would include exceptions for unaccompanied children and in certain humanitarian situations. But they would still represent a dramatic crackdown by a Democratic president who once campaigned against Donald Trump's hardline approach to immigration.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Alex Padilla, one of his chamber's leading pro-immigration voices, suggested the order was unlikely to succeed as a deterrent. \"You can build a wall as high as you want. You can make it hard to receive asylum if you want. It's not going to sustainably reduce the number of people wanting to come to the United States for a number of reasons until you identify and address root causes,\" he told Semafor.\n\nThe mass influx of asylum seekers at the border has proven to be one of Biden's stickiest political challenges; polls by Gallup have found it's now the issue Americans are most likely to cite as the most important problem facing the country, while a New York Times survey in March found that 49% of registered voters would back new asylum restrictions, versus 43% who would oppose them.\n\nStill, left-leaning Democrats questioned whether Biden's move to the right on the issue would boost his fortunes.\n\n\"We shouldn't fall into the trap that Republicans have set for us,\" Texas Rep. Greg Casar, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told Semafor. \"It's going to not help the President politically because I don't think Fox News is ever going to give him any credit.\"\n\nBiden plans to issue the order under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to suspend the entry of foreigners that \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" Republicans have urged Biden to clamp down on asylum claims via the law, which former President Trump previously invoked to impose policies such as his so-called \"Muslim ban.\" Progressives are fretting about the legal precedent Biden may be setting for a successor by using the statute in such an aggressive manner.\n\n\"God forbid Donald Trump ends up getting elected,\" said Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois. \"Every Republican president moving forward will do the same thing and more. It only gets worse from here.\"\n\nSome noted that Biden is issuing the order at a moment that border crossings have been in decline. CBS News reported that border crossings in May dropped 54% from their record highs in December, when it reached a daily average of over 8,000 per day.\n\n\"The drop in border crossings should be a lesson here to build on,\" Padilla told Semafor. \"The numbers are down because we've engaged with governmental leaders in Mexico. That needs to continue and we need to build on that by engaging additional countries in the hemisphere. That is a way forward.\"\n\nBoth Biden and Trump's past efforts to slow the arrival of migrants via executive authority have often been tied up in court. By Monday, progressive legal groups were already hinting they were prepared to file suit again. \"We will need to review the executive order before making litigation decisions, but any policy that effectively shuts off asylum would raise obvious legal problems, just as we did when the Trump administration tried to end asylum,\" Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigrants' rights project, said in a statement.\n\nPlenty of Democrats, including vulnerable moderates and the party's Senate campaign chief, appear to be welcoming the move by Biden.\n\n\"It's great. We believe in being tough on the border,\" said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who helms the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"We just wish our Republican colleagues would actually take the votes necessary to secure the border.\"", "source": {"uri":

The White House did not have an immediate comment.\n\nBiden plans to use section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to carry out the action. Former President Donald Trump relied on the same section of the immigration act when he introduced restrictions during his presidency.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus asked Biden not to use the same section of the act to carry out his order during a late May meeting at the White House.\n\nBiden's order comes after a bipartisan deal collapsed in the Senate that would have allowed for the automatic closure of the border when the number of crossings reached a certain threshold. That bill set the conditions for a closure at an average of 4,000 migrants per day in a given week, including at ports of entry, with a mandatory shutdown at 5,000 migrants per day on average.\n\nUnauthorized migration at the U.S. border exploded after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Biden administration has been working to contain crossings ever since with uneven results.\n\nThe executive order addresses one aspect of migration: asylum-seekers who, rather than sneaking over the border, cross and turn themselves in to border agents.\n\nU.S. laws are contradictory: Crossing between ports of entry is illegal under Title 8, but under the same U.S. code migrants still retain the right to seek asylum under even if they do.\n\nAnd despite Biden's creation of new lawful pathways asylum-seekers have continued to try their luck between ports of entry.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol encounters and apprehensions peaked above 2.4 million in fiscal year 2023 -- an all-time high.\n\nSo far, this fiscal year, Border Patrol has reported more than 1.5 million apprehensions.\n\nIllegal crossings were lower in March and April compared with the same period a year ago, but many

Once triggered, the cap would result in the border being shut to asylum seekers, who would then be turned away or returned to their home countries.\n\nAccording to government data cited by the WaPo, there was an average of more than 3,500 illegal crossings per day at the southern border in recent weeks. Official estimates indicate that there have been approximately 2 million illegal crossings a year since 2021.\n\nRepublicans have been highly critical of Biden's handling of the situation, accusing him of dereliction of duty. With the topic dominating the ongoing presidential campaign ahead of the November election, GOP frontrunner and former president Donald Trump has vowed to enact a sweeping crackdown on illegal migration if he is returned to the White House.\n\nAccording to the media, the executive order that Biden plans to sign on Tuesday would introduce a threshold of 2,500 illegal migrants. His administration has been considering the measure since Republican lawmakers shot down bipartisan border legislation earlier this year. At that time, Trump and other members of the GOP dismissed the bill as not being tough enough.\n\nWhile there are already some measures in place aimed at curbing the flow of illegal migrants, many of them are being rendered unworkable as border authorities are overstretched, the WaPo pointed out. Migrants' countries of origin also may not agree to take back their citizens.\n\nMexico, too, has caps on the number of non-Mexican migrants that it will accept from the US, with that number standing at 30,000 per month.\n\nAmid the government's apparent inability to control the situation at the southern border, Texas Governor Greg Abbott invoked the state's \"constitutional right of self defense... stemming from Joe Biden's refusal to enforce immigration laws\" in January. He argued that the White House's perceived inaction had \"caused an unprecedented invasion that we must defend against.\"\n\nIn a comment to the WaPo, White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez suggested it was the Republicans who \"chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement.\"\n\n\"President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the president's attempts to get tough on immigration have come under fire from the left within his own Democratic Party.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.06/article/665f059f2030272c6b659a70.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Senior administration officials said they expect to remove these individuals \"in a matter of days, if not hours.\"\n\nAlso, migrants who cross the Southern border unlawfully and are processed for expedited removal would get a credible fear screening if they manifest a fear of returning to their country or their intention to apply for asylum. However, the threshold for credible fear would be increased.\n\nThe restrictions will remain in place until 14 days after the seven-day average of illegal crossings drops below 1,500. The measures will go back into effect once the number reaches 2,500.\n\nBiden, who is running for reelection and has been facing criticism for the high number of migrants entering the United States, is relying on section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to implement these restrictions.\n\nThis is the same law former President Donald Trump -- who is challenging Biden in this year's election -- used in 2017 to ban immigration from several majority-Muslim countries, and in 2018 to suspend the entry of migrants between ports of entry along the Southern border. As it happened during the Trump administration, Biden's executive order is expected to be challenged by immigrant rights groups.\n\nAmy Fischer, the Director of Refugee and Migrant Rights at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that Biden's actions \"set a dangerous international precedent.\"\n\n\"It's deeply disappointing to see President Biden so hellbent on dismantling human rights for people seeking asylum and implementing policies that are plainly illegal under international and refugee law,\" Fischer said.\n\nSenior administration officials told reporters the U.S. will continue to return nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to Mexico.\n\nMigrants hailing from outside the Western Hemisphere will be subject to the provisions, although administration officials said it is a challenge.\n\n\"We are confident that the steps we are taking today are consistent with our obligations under international law,\" an official said.\n\nUsing the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\nThe section 212(f) is a provision from the Immigration and Nationality Act (1952) which empowers the president to \"suspend\" or restrict the entry of migrants into the country when deemed necessary.\n\nBill Hing, a professor of law and migration studies at the University of San Francisco, said there are many laws that prevent certain immigrants from coming to the country, like those who are members of a terrorist organization.\n\nHowever, section 212(f) is more encompassing.\n\n\"(It's) much broader,\" Hing said. \"It just says that the President has the power through a proclamation to restrict the entry of people who are coming to the United States, in the opinion of the President, who are detrimental to the interest of the United States.\"\n\nHing called the language of the law \"ambiguous.\"\n\nThe section has been used by Democratic and Republican presidents in the past to curtail illegal migration.\n\nFor instance, in 1981 President Ronald Reagan invoked it to restrict Haitians from coming into the U.S. He also used it to suspend the entry of Cubans, Nicaraguans part of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, and Panamanians officials under the dictatorship of Manuel Antonio Noriega.\n\nSince then, section 212(f) has been used to block certain citizens from several countries, including China, Iran, Venezuela, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania.\n\nBut most notoriously, it was invoked by President Donald Trump in January 2017, and was dubbed a \"Muslim ban.\" Trump's executive order indefinitely ended the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and banned the entry of citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days. President Biden revoked that executive order in 2021.\n\nBiden's decision\n\nPresident Biden's actions on Tuesday come as the numbers of unauthorized crossings in the U.S.-Mexico border have continued to go down in recent months, defying migration patterns.\n\nIn December, Border Patrol agents made nearly 250,000 encounters with migrants between the point of entries in the Southern border -- a record high.\n\nHowever, those numbers have sharply decreased. In April, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 129,000 encounters.\n\nImmigration policy analysts have said the numbers are due to Mexico's enforcement of its own immigration law at their southern border with Guatemala and the northern border with the U.S.\n\nRolando Salinas, the mayor of Eagle Pass, Texas, questioned Biden's timing for this announcement.\n\nEagle Pass has been the epicenter of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's fight with the Biden administration over its handling of immigration.\n\n\"I just wish this was done back in December when our city was being hit with 2-3 thousand people per day,\" Salinas told NPR in a text message. \"We won't forget those days.\"\n\nOver the last few months, Biden has been announcing narrow policies at the border, including proposing a new rule intended to speed up the removal of some migrants ineligible for asylum.\n\nBiden's decision will likely be challenged in court by immigrant rights groups.\n\nWhen he used section 212(f) in 2021 as part of his public health efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, that's exactly what happened. Under his order, Biden suspended the entry of non-U.S. citizens who were within the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, and South Africa during 14 days prior to their attempt to enter the United States.\n\nIt also applied to those who had been in the Schengen Area, which is made up of 29 European countries.\n\nLily Axelrod, an immigration attorney based in Memphis, Tenn., said that measure was \"quite disruptive to business and family.\"\n\nMaribel Hernandez Perez, director of policy and government affairs for border and immigration at the ACLU, said Biden's latest executive order will likely have a negative impact on the legal pathways of migration to the U.S.\n\n\"Whenever you do anything that bars people from applying for asylum, what you're doing is in fact disrupting the legal pathways that people have,\" Hernandez Perez said.\n\nShe said Biden's actions are a \"missed opportunity\" to take action to better manage illegal crossings at the Southern border.\n\n\"That is just a repeat of what President Trump did, that is just a repeat of cruel policies,\" Hernandez Perez said.\n\nHernandez Perez added Biden should focus on his campaign promise of restoring the asylum system in the country.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sergio_martinez_beltran@npr.org", "name": "Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Beltr\u00e1n", "type":

New rules will come into effect when daily border encounters exceed certain thresholds, imposing harsher measures on asylum seekers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has unveiled an ambitious plan aimed at imposing stringent restrictions on asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. The move, which comes ahead of the November elections, seeks to counter immigration as a looming political liability. A White House proclamation detailed that asylum will be denied to migrants if US officials judge the southern border to be under strain.\n\nThe Democratic president's decision follows the breakdown of a bipartisan deal in Congress, rejected by most Republicans under the influence of Donald Trump. The new asylum restrictions will be triggered when border encounters exceed 2,500 per day, a number already surpassed, implying immediate implementation. Measures include rapid removals and possible criminal prosecution for non-compliant migrants.\n\nAlthough the Biden administration has arrangements in place with Mexico to accept certain deported citizens, many operational and legal complexities remain. Using the legal authority granted under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Biden's order aims to be both tougher and more humane compared to previous directives. Yet, criticisms and legal challenges from various quarters are anticipated, casting uncertainty over the directive's future.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_09_52_50_9661367.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

What does it mean for the United States?\n\nEarlier this year, a bipartisan deal collapsed in the Senate that would have allowed for the automatic closure of the border when the number of crossings reached a certain threshold. That bill set the conditions for a closure at an average of 4,000 migrants per day in a given week, including at ports of entry, with a mandatory shutdown at 5,000 migrants per day on average.\n\nUnauthorized migration at the U.S. border exploded after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Biden administration has been working to contain crossings ever since with uneven results.\n\nThe executive order addresses one aspect of migration: asylum-seekers who, rather than sneaking over the border, cross and turn themselves in to border agents.\n\nU.S. laws are contradictory: Crossing between ports of entry is illegal under Title 8, but under the same U.S. code migrants still retain the right to seek asylum under even if they do.\n\nAnd despite Biden's creation of new lawful pathways asylum-seekers have continued to try their luck between ports of entry.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol encounters and apprehensions peaked above 2.4 million in fiscal year 2023 -- an all-time high.\n\nSo far, this fiscal year, Border Patrol has reported more than 1.5 million apprehensions.\n\nIllegal crossings were lower in March and April compared with the same period a year ago, but many

People who cross the border unlawfully will be deemed ineligible for asylum absent of compelling circumstances, and they will only be referred to an asylum officer under specific circumstances. And migrants who are screened by an asylum officer will also face higher standards than what was previously used to determine fear or the intention to seek asylum.\n\nThe move by Biden to take executive action got mixed reactions from across the political spectrum. For the right, it's too little, too late, and many wondered why he didn't take the action in the first place.

One such bill, authored by right-leaning Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), was scuttled by Trump, who wanted to deny Biden a victory during an election year.

On June 4th Mr Biden revealed an executive order that will theoretically allow him to deny asylum to migrants who cross illegally when their number is high.\n\nThe administration has been mulling executive action since Senate Republicans, at Donald Trump's behest, torpedoed a bipartisan bill they had helped to craft. The order borrows ideas from that bill. It would bar those who cross between ports of entry from receiving asylum when encounters of migrants at the southern border exceed an average of 2,500 a day. That threshold would be easily met. Asylum-seekers would then be turned back into Mexico or deported until apprehensions fall below 1,500 a day. The order reflects a markedly conservative turn for Mr Biden, who telegraphed openness to migrants when he took office in 2021.\n\nToo bad it won't work. There are three reasons why. First, it will surely be tied up in the courts. The order's power is derived from an obscure statute that gives presidents broad authority to suspend the entry of people who \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States\". But applying that notion to asylum contravenes both international and domestic laws which hold that asylum-seekers can lodge a claim no matter how they enter the country. The courts blocked Mr Trump from barring asylum for those who crossed the border illegally. A similar, already existing Biden-administration rule is in legal limbo.\n\nSecond, it is unclear how the order can be enforced. There are some screenings the government will not halt, such as determining whether migrants would be subject to persecution or torture in their country if returned, though the order does raise the standard to be considered for such protections. Turning migrants back into Mexico depends on Mexican co-operation. And Mr Biden has increased deportations, but they are a costly logistical nightmare. Not every country accepts deportees. Venezuelans, for example, have accounted for 12% of migrant encounters at the southern border this fiscal year. Yet Venezuela stopped allowing deportation flights early this year when relations with America soured.\n\nLast, the surge in migrant apprehensions under Title 42, a public-health measure brought in during the pandemic that allowed America to quickly return migrants to Mexico, should serve as a warning. Migrants just tried to cross again -- and again. Rather than reducing Border Patrol's workload, the executive order may inflate it. To try to prevent this, the order threatens removed migrants with a five-year ban on re-entry and possible criminal prosecution should they try to cross again.\n\nSo why issue an order at all? Mr Biden may hope that tough talk deters migrants from making the journey. That could happen. But he is also thinking about the election. The bipartisan border bill failed because Mr Trump and Republicans wanted to be able to campaign on \"Biden's border chaos\", rather than fix the problem. That left the president with few options. Just 32% of registered voters polled in May by YouGov and The Economist approve of Mr Biden's handling of immigration. He is trailing Mr Trump by nearly five points in Arizona and six in Nevada, south-western swing states where the border feels more visceral. If voters consider the order an earnest attempt to solve the issue, then Mr Biden is betting that impractical policy will at least make good politics.\u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20240608_USP504.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 279, "textEnd": 287}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

When you have more than 5,000 people a day trying to cross the border, you can't manage it, (we) can slow it down. (But) there's no guarantee of that. Without the law (support from Congress) I would have all that authority.\" I will keep it,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, after the possibility of an immigration executive order was raised again, the White House told Univision Notices via email that the administration \"continues to explore a number of policy options, and we remain committed to taking action to fix our broken immigration system.\" Immigration\".\n\nAn official added, \"From day one (January 20, 2021, when Biden took office), the administration is always evaluating what steps can be taken. \"A final decision has not been made on what, if any, additional administrative action can be taken.\"\n\nThe White House has recognized that this is an urgent resource and has tasked Republicans with implementing it.\n\n\"Republicans in Congress don't care about securing the border or fixing America's failed immigration system,\" reads a response sent to Univision Notices.\n\n\"If they had, they would have voted to implement the toughest border law in history. Instead, they are putting party politics before the national security of our country,\" he added.\n\nLast May, Senate President Charles Schumer (D-NY) failed in his second attempt to pass a bipartisan bill that would have given Biden $14 billion to end the crisis that began in 2013, leading an emergency plan on the Mexico border. For the last three years, after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe funds will be used to hire 1,500 additional Customs and Border Protection personnel, more than 1,200 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, more than 4,300 additional asylum officers and 100 additional immigration judges, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Alejandro Mayorgas.\n\n\"The administration may also limit the number of people who can apply to enter the United States,\" he added. Rumors so far \"suggest that President Biden will use a section of the U.S. immigration code known as 212(f) as authority for the restrictions,\" he said in an email.\n\nFormer President Trump \"tried to use Section 212(f) to restrict entry into the United States, but was challenged in court,\" Yale-Lohr recalled.\n\n\"Courts have said that all presidents have broad authority over immigration because immigration affects foreign relations and sovereignty. But that power is not absolute,\" he warns.\n\nYale-Lohr added, \"Immigrant rights advocates will immediately sue President Biden to try to block his executive action from going into effect. Ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to decide when a president goes too far on immigration.\"\n\nSection 212(f) is a \"controversial\" tool, says Angel Leal, an immigration and constitutional attorney practicing in Miami, Florida. \"It all depends on how the president tries to implement it,\" he said.\n\nSection 212(f), which can be invoked in the event of a national emergency, \"would prohibit the granting of asylum to aliens who entered irregularly or crossed the border illegally, which would affect the right to asylum,\" Leal said. It is currently in effect\".\n\nWhen asked whether this type of executive order would be challenged in the courts, Leal said, \"It all depends on the interpretation the executive branch makes of it and the application it gives to the regulation.\"\n\nHowever, Leal noted that Biden's potential immigration executive action \"will not take effect\" immediately, based on the latest data provided by the Border Patrol and a significant decrease in arrests in May compared to the previous month. and years.\n\nHe noted that other aspects of the potential order, such as giving border agents extraordinary powers, could harm the immigration process approved by the Legislature.\n\nIn the first 21 days of May, Border Patrol agents recorded a daily average of about 3,700 migrant apprehensions between ports of entry, a 54% drop from the daily average of 8,000 in December.\n\nThe border between Tijuana and San Diego is one of the areas where migrants cross the most: authorities can't cope",

The temporary measures will remain in place until such crossings dip below 1,500 per day, said senior administration officials who briefed reporters on a call previewing the actions.\n\nThe Democratic president backed a failed, bipartisan measure earlier in the year that would have authorized him to put similar restrictions in place.\n\nEndorsing it, Biden said, \"It'll also give me as president, the emergency authority to shut down the border until it could get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I'd shut down the border right now and fix it quickly.\"\n\nBut with Congress frozen in place, Biden's administration said Tuesday that he would act alone, using the same authority that former President Donald Trump once relied on to restrict immigration to the United States.\n\nBiden has for months been looking for ways to act that his administration thought would stand up in court. His administration began to soften its stance in recent weeks on what that could look like.\n\nSenior administration officials who briefed reporters ahead of the announcement said the change is meant to deter migration to the southern border. In the current fiscal year, U.S. Border Patrol has reported more than 1.5 million encounters and apprehension.\n\nRepublican lawmakers reacted to the anticipated announcement by asking why Biden did not take the action earlier. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday that executive action by Biden would be \"too little, too late\" and accused him of exacerbating the problems at the border with his policies.\n\n\"The only reason he's doing that is because the polls say that it's the biggest issue in America. Every state's a border state,\" Johnson said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nTrump used the same legal authority to enact a travel ban on Muslim-majority nations when he was president. Biden reversed it when he took office.\n\nWhite House officials said that actions differ from Trump's because they only apply when encounters are unexpectedly high and they apply evenly all migrants who enter the country without permission.\n\nThe order comes as polling shows immigration as the top issue for voters in the November election and as Biden is tied with or trailing Trump in key states.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration to the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive Order 13769"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1VMHkvy5sp3Bxb4lM9W9iA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/63d79e2cc40739b71cd59cbb017ff63b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It does this by not allowing migrants in custody to request asylum, thus allowing federal police to remove them from the country.\n\nMigrants who do not express a fear of being returned home will be removed within \"a matter of days, if not hours,\" the first official said. For migrants who do state that they fear being returned to their home country, they will be screened against a \"substantially higher standard\" than the threshold that has been used as the basis for being able to seek asylum.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the standard will be significantly higher, and so we do anticipate that fewer individuals will be screened in as a result,\" the first official said.\n\nUnder the new protocols, the asylum ban will remain in effect if the seven-day average of migrants apprehended by Border Patrol agents between the ports of entry is above 2,500 arrests per day. The ban will only be walked back if the seven-day average of migrants arrested drops below 1,500 apprehensions daily, according to the administration officials.\n\nIt is up to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to determine whether the number of crossings constitutes the ban remaining in place or being lifted. At present, approximately 4,000 to 5,000 migrants are being arrested daily.\n\n\"These actions will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the southern border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today, they will make it easier for immigration officials to remove those who are here unlawfully and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents,\" said a second senior administration official who spoke with reporters.\n\nWhen asked how the Biden administration arrived at the 2,500 figure, the second official said the number was \"similar to\" the levels negotiated under the failed Senate bipartisan bill.\n\nHowever, the White House declined to answer a question about whether migrants who seek asylum at a port of entry would be counted toward the 2,500 threshold. Migrants who apply for admission prior to arriving at the border through the CBP One phone app will not be counted toward the daily cap.\n\nMigrants arrested attempting to enter Florida and Puerto Rico by sea are also banned from seeking asylum.\n\nBut the Biden administration has carved out some exceptions to the new protocols.\n\nUnder the new process, migrants will not automatically be as easily able to avert deportation by making a general claim of being afraid to return home. Migrants will only go through a screening process to see if they have a credible fear for seeking asylum if they specifically \"express a fear of return to their country or country of removal, a fear of persecution or torture, or an intention to apply for asylum.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nUnaccompanied migrant children will not be immediately turned away. Adult migrants who present \"exceptionally compelling circumstances\" will also be exempt from the asylum ban, according to the administration officials.\n\nBiden administration officials said that they are prepared to defend the asylum ban from lawsuits and added that the Biden administration had improved the asylum system for migrants abroad to seek admission to a greater extent than any previous administration.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_giaritelli@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Anna Giaritelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24129017961589-2.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The measure, which would restrict access to asylum, would take effect when U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions surpass 2,500 per day, the two sources said. The illegal crossings would have to dip below 1,500 per day for the asylum restrictions to be lifted, one of the sources said.\n\nThe restrictions are not expected to apply to unaccompanied minors. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The election-year move is expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden, a Democrat, for adopting hardline policies that mirror those of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for voting-age Americans in the run-up to Nov. 5 elections where he will face Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest. Biden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally.

The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.

That executive action was heavily criticized by Democrats at the time, with Biden signing an order early in his term to reverse Trump's so-called \"Muslim ban.\"\n\nTrump's campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday morning that Tuesday's executive order was for amnesty, not border security.\n\n\"After importing more than 15 million illegal aliens into our country and releasing countless criminal migrants who have brutally raped and murdered our citizens, this new order will facilitate the release of more illegals as quickly as possible with a smartphone app,\" Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nResearch earlier this year showed there was little evidence to support the Trump campaign's claims, with data stating that there was no significant link between immigration and crime rates. Several studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S citizens.\n\nBiden had recently attempted to tackle the issues at the border through bipartisan legislation which would have provided extra funding for Homeland Security, but that bill was voted down by Republicans after Trump put pressure on them.\n\nThe Executive Order allows the president to take at least some of the actions he wanted to through that failed bill.\n\nDemocrat Texas Representative Henry Cuellar told the Associated Press that for this EO to succeed, cooperation with Mexico would be key.\n\n\"If you think about the logistics, where else can they go?\" Cuellar told the outlet. \"If they're not going to let them in, where do they go? Do they return them (to Mexico), or do they try to deport as many as they can?\n\n\"We did add a lot more money into ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) so they can deport, but the easiest thing, of course, is just send them back to Mexico. You've got to have the help of Mexico to make this work.\"\n\nThe president spoke with Mexico's newly-elected leader Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday and both emphasized their commitment to work collaboratively.

Over the past three years, while Congress has failed to act, the President has acted to secure our border. His Administration has deployed the most agents and officers ever to address the situation at the Southern border, seized record levels of illicit fentanyl at our ports of entry, and brought together world leaders on a framework to deal with changing migration patterns that are impacting the entire Western Hemisphere.\n\nEarlier this year, the President and his team reached a historic bipartisan agreement with Senate Democrats and Republicans to deliver the most consequential reforms of America's immigration laws in decades. This agreement would have added critical border and immigration personnel, invested in technology to catch illegal fentanyl, delivered sweeping reforms to the asylum system, and provided emergency authority for the President to shut down the border when the system is overwhelmed. But Republicans in Congress chose to put partisan politics ahead of our national security, twice voting against the toughest and fairest set of reforms in decades.\n\nPresident Biden believes we must secure our border. That is why today, he announced executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. These actions will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the Southern Border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today. They will make it easier for immigration officers to remove those without a lawful basis to remain and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents.\n\nBut we must be clear: this cannot achieve the same results as Congressional action, and it does not provide the critical personnel and funding needed to further secure our Southern border. Congress still must act.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration's executive actions will:\n\nBar Migrants Who Cross the Southern Border Unlawfully From Receiving Asylum\n\nPresident Biden issued a proclamation under Immigration and Nationality Act sections 212(f) and 215(a) suspending entry of noncitizens who cross the Southern border into the United States unlawfully. This proclamation is accompanied by an interim final rule from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security that restricts asylum for those noncitizens.\n\nThese actions will be in effect when the Southern border is overwhelmed, and they will make it easier for immigration officers to quickly remove individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States.\n\nThese actions are not permanent. They will be discontinued when the number of migrants who cross the border between ports of entry is low enough for America's system to safely and effectively manage border operations. These actions also include similar humanitarian exceptions to those included in the bipartisan border agreement announced in the Senate, including those for unaccompanied children and victims of trafficking.\n\nRecent Actions to secure our border and address our broken immigration system:\n\nStrengthening the Asylum Screening Process\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security published a proposed rule to ensure that migrants who pose a public safety or national security risk are removed as quickly in the process as possible rather than remaining in prolonged, costly detention prior to removal. This proposed rule will enhance security and deliver more timely consequences for those who do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States.\n\nAnnounced new actions to more quickly resolve immigration cases\n\nThe Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security launched a Recent Arrivals docket to more quickly resolve a portion of immigration cases for migrants who attempt to cross between ports of entry at the Southern border in violation of our immigration laws.\n\nThrough this process, the Department of Justice will be able to hear these cases more quickly and the Department of Homeland Security will be able to more quickly remove individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States and grant protection to those with valid claims.\n\nThe bipartisan border agreement would have created and supported an even more efficient framework for issuing final decisions to all asylum seekers. This new process to reform our overwhelmed immigration system can only be created and funded by Congress.\n\nRevoked visas of CEOs and government officials who profit from migrants coming to the U.S. unlawfully\n\nThe Department of State imposed visa restrictions on executives of several Colombian transportation companies who profit from smuggling migrants by sea. This action cracks down on companies that help facilitate unlawful entry into the United States, and sends a clear message that no one should profit from the exploitation of vulnerable migrants.\n\nThe State Department also imposed visa restrictions on over 250 members of the Nicaraguan government, non-governmental actors, and their immediate family members for their roles in supporting the Ortega-Murillo regime, which is selling transit visas to migrants from within and beyond the Western Hemisphere who ultimately make their way to the Southern border.\n\nPreviously, the State Department revoked visas of executives of charter airlines for similar actions.\n\nExpanded Efforts to Dismantle Human Smuggling and Support Immigration Prosecutions\n\nThe Departments of State and Justice launched an \"Anti-Smuggling Rewards\" initiative designed to dismantle the leadership of human smuggling organizations that bring migrants through Central America and across the Southern U.S. border. The initiative will offer financial rewards for information leading to the identification, location, arrest, or conviction of those most responsible for significant human smuggling activities in the region.\n\nThe Department of Justice will seek new and increased penalties against human smugglers to properly account for the severity of their criminal conduct and the human misery that it causes.\n\nThe Department of Justice is also partnering with the Department of Homeland Security to direct additional prosecutors and support staff to increase immigration-related prosecutions in crucial border U.S. Attorney's Offices. Efforts include deploying additional DHS Special Assistant United States Attorneys to different U.S. Attorneys' offices, assigning support staff to critical U.S. Attorneys' offices, including DOJ Attorneys to serve details in U.S. Attorneys' Offices in several border districts, and partnering with federal agencies to identify additional resources to target these crimes.\n\nEnhancing Immigration Enforcement\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has surged agents to the Southern border and is referring a record number of people into expedited removal.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is operating more repatriation flights per week than ever before. Over the past year, DHS has removed or returned more than 750,000 people, more than in every fiscal year since 2010.\n\nWorking closely with partners throughout the region, the Biden-Harris Administration is identifying and collaborating on enforcement efforts designed to stop irregular migration before migrants reach our Southern border, expand investment and integration opportunities in the region to support those who may otherwise seek to migrate, and increase lawful pathways for migrants as an alternative to irregular migration.\n\nSeizing Fentanyl at our Border\n\nBorder officials have seized more fentanyl at ports of entry in the last two years than the past five years combined, and the President has added 40 drug detection machines across points of entry to disrupt the fentanyl smuggling into the Homeland. The bipartisan border agreement would fund the installation of 100 additional cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our Southern border ports of entry.\n\nIn close partnership with the Government of Mexico, the Department of Justice has extradited Nestor Isidro Perez Salaz, known as \"El Nini,\" from Mexico to the United States to face prosecution for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and human rights abuses. This is one of many examples of joint efforts with Mexico to tackle the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our countries and globally, and to hold the drug trafficking organizations to account.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz",

Greg Stanton.\n\nMayors of Arizona's main border cities rejected an invitation from President Joe Biden to join him in Washington this week to unveil an executive action that is expected to curb access to asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe announcement could come as early as Tuesday, but the White House has not confirmed any details. However, the Biden administration did reach out the mayors of U.S. border communities to invite them to join him in Washington for the announcement.\n\nThe offices of San Luis Mayor Nieves Riedel and Yuma Mayor Doug Nicholls confirmed that they received an invitation from the White House. But Riedel and Nicholls declined, citing scheduling conflicts. The mayor of Nogales has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nDouglas Mayor Donald Huish told The Republic that he was not invited to Washington, but said he would be anxiously listening to the announcement.\n\n\"At least I hope it starts a conversation again. That maybe Congress can jump in and try to iron this out, do the right thing,\" Huish said.\n\nSo far, the mayors of two Texas border cities have confirmed they will be traveling to Washington from Brownsville and Edinburg in the Rio Grande Valley, according to the Associated Press. This area was the busiest crossing route into the United States for nearly a decade, before the flow of migrants shifted west to Del Rio and to Arizona.\n\nThe executive order that Biden is expected to unveil as early as Tuesday would allow U.S. border officials to shut down asylum processing along the U.S.-Mexico border if the number of migrant encounters in between the ports of entry reaches 2,500 per day over a week-long period.\n\nCalled out: Kyrsten Sinema calls out Senate Democrats and GOP as bipartisan border deal fails again\n\nThe effect at the border would be immediate. In April, the last month with available data, the U.S. Border Patrol encountered on average about 4,200 migrants per day along the southern U.S. border. That would allow the Border Patrol to shut down access to asylum in between border crossings, even though the number of migrant crossings has decreased considerably so far this year.\n\nEven though the text or full details of the executive action remain under wraps, immigration and migrant advocacy groups did not wait to speak out against the expected executive order.\n\n\"The decision by this administration to criminalize migrants, many of whom are fleeing harm, is deeply disturbing and misguided,\" said Sarah Rich, the senior supervising attorney and interim senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"We have witnessed how such prosecutions can be weaponized to separate and traumatize immigrant families,\" Rich added. \"Prosecuting people seeking safety in the U.S. for these immigration violations will lead to more Black and Brown people being incarcerated at the expense of immigrant families and communities.\"\n\nHave any news tips or story ideas about immigration in the Southwest?

Republicans have said he is not doing enough to stop the arrival of migrants, with conservative politicians blocking critical foreign aid packages for months in a bid to secure funding for the border.\n\n\"If he was actually concerned about our wide-open border, he would have acted a long time ago,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said before the announcement.\n\nSome of Mr Biden's own Democrats have also criticised him over the border, saying his approach ignores the importance of granting asylum and fails to address the need to reform the path to immigration.\n\nMr Biden has continued to run up against the issue as he campaigns for re-election, with recent polls suggesting it is among the most important for voters.\n\nDespite criticism of Mr Biden, migrant arrivals appear to be in decline. In April, US Border Patrol recorded 128,900 encounters along the south-west border, down 30 per cent compared to the same time last year, Customs and Border Protection data showed.\n\nThis comes after more than 250,000 encounters in December, a record high.\n\nA major piece of the puzzle in the success of Mr Biden's strategy is likely to be Mexico, which has long walked a tightrope when it comes to migration, caught between the US to the north and impoverished countries in Central America and the Caribbean to the south.\n\nOfficials on Mexico's southern border with Guatemala are stretched thin with migrants regularly crossing into the country illegally, with \"caravans\" of sometimes several thousand making their way north.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has proved himself to be malleable when it comes to the US border - despite coming into office stating he would not do Washington's \"dirty work\" when it came to migrants.\n\nHowever, Mr Lopez Obrador will be leaving office in the autumn, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Claudia Sheinbaum - who was relatively tight-lipped on most policy issues throughout her campaign - will become the new president.\n\nMs Sheinbaum did say in March that Mexico \"will always defend a relationship of equals, never submission, to the United States\".", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_ruthven@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Sara Ruthven", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sheinbaum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Sheinbaum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Manuel_L\u00f3pez_Obrador", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LS5FXFVRSRDZVOPZGJOF5GSWD4.jpg?smart=true&auth=6c3cfad0817ed5e1ecd8df408e1c8fc93279aa9005a3696bd46b44d1d541d12e&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

That threshold, administration officials said, has already been hit over the past week.\n\nThe announcement represents an aggressive attempt by Biden to bolster his standing on the border in advance of the November election. Biden is expected to use a speech on Tuesday to highlight his unilateral efforts to resolve the crisis, while congressional Republicans -- at the behest of Donald Trump -- killed efforts to pass bipartisan border legislation earlier this year.\n\nThe president will be joined later on Tuesday by members of Congress and local and state leaders from border cities and states, in an effort to project consensus and political strength on a topic that has long dogged him politically.

Apparently, Biden can no longer ignore the polls.\n\nBiden has hemmed and hawed for years that he's helpless to slow down border encounters that have more than doubled during his tenure and that he's reliant on Congress to help out.\n\nThat was always untrue. In his first days in office, after all, Biden used his executive authority to end Trump administration policies like \"Remain in Mexico\" that were helpful in curbing asylum claims that have overwhelmed our border.\n\nBiden simply chose to ignore the problem. Plus, he didn't want to pick fights with progressives in his party who'd rather there not be any limits on the border.\n\nThat strategy has backfired spectacularly. Biden's tanking poll numbers are due in no small part to his mismanagement of illegal immigration.\n\nBorder chaos: Trump and Biden keep blaming each other. But voters want solutions, not chaos at border.\n\nImmigration, along with the economy and inflation, has soared to one of the top issues on voters' minds as we head toward the presidential election. It's not just a border problem anymore, as cities - often large, Democratic ones like Chicago and New York - are dealing with an influx of migrants.\n\nIt's no surprise that voters trust former President Donald Trump over Biden by double digits on these issues: Trump has a 17-point lead on immigration and a 14-point lead on the economy and inflation, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll from last month.\n\nBiden reportedly plans to sign the executive order Tuesday, in the presence of several mayors from South Texas.\n\nThe order will more strictly cap the number of illegal crossings. If the number of crossings average 2,500 a day, then border officials would be able to quickly expel migrants without a chance for asylum.\n\nTrump convicted: Trump is guilty. It won't matter at all this election.\n\nWhile numbers have fallen since late last year, they have remained high. In December, there was an all-time monthly record of migrant encounters - 250,000 - crossing into the United States from Mexico.\n\nIn the first three weeks of May, the U.S. Border Patrol reported a daily average of 3,700 apprehensions of migrants, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.\n\nSo Biden's new order will have immediate consequences if these numbers remain high.\n\nIn addition to all the surveys showing Americans don't trust Biden to handle the border crisis, there could be something else that nudged the president to take action this week.\n\nTrump, who was convicted in his hush money trial Thursday, isn't the only one in the hot seat. Biden's son Hunter is in court in Wilmington, Delaware, as his felony gun trial begins. The younger Biden is charged with lying on a federal gun form in 2018 about his drug addiction. A jury was selected on Monday.\n\nSeparately, he faces three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors in a California federal court after he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes, instead spending the money on \"on drugs, escorts and girlfriends.\"\n\nDe Niro's Trump rant: Hate to break it to you, Joe. Robert De Niro's Trump rant won't win Biden more fans.\n\nAll of this is bad enough, not to mention the attention Republicans in Congress have brought to Hunter Biden's shady business deals.\n\nIn other words, it's embarrassing for the president, who's trying to write off all his son's bad behavior as a result of his addiction.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

But these aren't the kind of headlines that will buoy a floundering reelection campaign.\n\nSo why not try to change the conversation with an executive order on immigration?\n\nBiden's now taking the right action. He just shouldn't have waited nearly four years to do it.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

It's a top concern for voters, one that Donald Trump and his allies have seized on. And tomorrow Biden is expected to take action issuing a major executive order allowing him to partially shut down the asylum process at the southern border. CBS News was the first to break the story, and tonight our Nancy Cordes is at The White House. Nancy, good to see you. So I understand this is going to be the most restrictive border policy ever enacted by a Democratic president, why now?\n\nNANCY CORDES: Well, Norah, The White House had been hoping that Congress would take this step. It didn't. This represents a major change to immigration policy, and we're told that the president is going to sign this executive order tomorrow. CBS News has learned that this new order will allow U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants without processing their asylum claims any time the number of illegal border crossings tops a specific threshold, and sources tell CBS that threshold is likely to be 2500 migrant apprehensions a day. Which means this partial ban could be triggered on day one because the number of apprehensions at the southern border in May was higher than that. It was 3800 a day according to the Border Patrol. Right now, of course, asylum-seekers are allowed to stay in the U.S. until their case is processed, which can take years. And critics say that creates an incentive for those who don't qualify to come to the U.S. anyway. This new executive order is almost certainly going to face legal challenges down the road, The White House appears to be going this route now because Republicans rejected a bipartisan senate deal that would have done something similar.

While these changes have been expected for a while, some don't believe it will solve the challenges with immigration.\n\n\"I think it's all politics,\" said Christina Brown, an immigration attorney and executive director of the Colorado Asylum Center, which provides legal representation to immigrants and helps them navigate the asylum process. Brown added that she was disappointed to learn the president was considering the rule changes.\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that this administration is once again politicizing asylum seekers and trying to, for what appears to be the upcoming presidential election,\" Brown said.\n\n48 Hours on the Border\n\nWhat happens in the first 48 hours after migrants arrive in the US?

It would require immigrants to return to Mexico and wait until the daily average of crossings falls.\n\n\"Honestly, there hasn't been a lot of difference between the Biden and Trump administrations on immigration policies at the border,\" Brown said.\n\nImmigration continues to be one of the top issues voters are concerned about. More than 42,000 immigrants have come to Denver in the last year and a half and the city has spent over $70 million in taxpayer dollars to house and feed them.\n\nDenver Mayor Mike Johnston said he didn't know about the president's plans when asked about it Monday.\n\n\"I must confess, I've not read it,\" Johnston said. \"I just saw the news alert on my phone the same way you have.\"\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocratic mayors plead with Biden for help addressing migrant crisis Gage Jackson 11:15 AM, Nov 02, 2023\n\nU.S. Sen.

We could've passed a bipartisan border bill to fix this crisis 118 days ago,\" said Hickenlooper. \"Today's severe executive order is a result of Republicans boycotting a bill they demanded and negotiated. President Biden is doing what he must. But we could do far more, far better if Republicans actually cared to solve the crisis.\"\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the crisis at the border wouldn't be fixed by this change.\n\n\"President Biden has engineered a wide-open southern border and is now trying to convince Americans that he wants to address the chaos he created,\" Johnson said. \"The American people know better. He intentionally created this crisis and an executive order won't change that.\"\n\n48 Hours on the Border\n\nWhat are the border policy differences between Biden and Trump? Joe St. George 12:04 PM, Mar 11, 2024\n\nBrown said immigrants seeking asylum have a right to do so under U.S. law and she doesn't believe the rule change would hold up under legal scrutiny.\n\n\"It's not legal and I cannot imagine that it would be held up in federal court,\" Brown said.\n\nShe added that while politicians play politics, she's thinking about the people forced to flee their homes who are now caught in the middle of this issue.\n\n\"I would urge people to show some compassion in the situation for people who literally have to give up everything to survive,\" Brown said.\n\nThis

But Biden faces another uphill battle - his age.\n\nPolls in recent months continue to portray that voters think the current president is too old or mentally and physically unfit for another four years in office. If elected for a second term, Biden would beat his own record set three-and-a-half-years ago by being the oldest president ever elected to office.\n\nPresident Joe Biden insists he 'can do better any anybody' as president in 2024 amid concerns over his age and dismissed his policies on illegal immigration exacerbated the southern border crisis\n\n'You are 81 years old, and would be 86 by the time you left office,' Washington Bureau Chief Massimo Calabresi and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs posed in their interview with Biden published online on Tuesday.\n\n'Large majorities of Americans, including in the Democratic Party, tell pollsters they think you are too old to lead. Could you really do this job as an 85-year old man?' they asked.\n\n'I can do it better than anybody you know,' the presumed 2024 Democratic candidate replied before challenging: 'You're looking at me, I can take you too.'\n\n'Did you consider not running again because of your age?'\n\nHe replied: 'No, I didn't.'\n\nRead More Joe Biden's 'crackdown' on illegal migrants ripped as a 2024 campaign 'stunt' as president plans to CLOSE the border if crossings skyrocket\n\n'And what do you say to Americans who are worried about it?' they followed-up.\n\n'Watch me,' Biden said. 'Look, name me a president that's gotten as much done as I've gotten done in my first three and a half years.'\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 8 million illegal immigrants crossed the southern border since Biden took office in January 2021, and some estimates put the number of undocumented migrants living in the U.S. at more than 20 million.\n\n'Another of your first acts as President under the banner of value-based leadership was to lift various punitive Trump-era immigration measures, Mr. President, that you and others said were inhumane. In retrospect, do you think those humanitarian moves helped drive record illegal border crossing?'\n\nBiden shot back with: 'No.'\n\n'Were you wrong to lift any of those measures?' they pressed.\n\n'If I was wrong, it's because I took too long,' the president replied.\n\nBut it didn't take Biden long to implement changes to policies that were enacted by former President Trump during his four years in office.\n\nIn fact, on Day One of his presidency, Biden announced he was taking at least five actions related to immigration and the southern border - including ending construction of the border wall and reopening immigration of migrants from countries seen as hostile to the U.S.\n\nBiden's interview with Time Magazine was defensive and, at times, combative as he was questioned on his record as president and his age going into November's election\n\nSince becoming president, Biden also ended Trump's Remain in Mexico policy and Title 42, which was a pandemic-era policy that allowed for more immediate deportation of illegal immigrants during a public health emergency.\n\nBiden told Time he is not examining reinstating Trump's so-called Remain in Mexico program despite reports to the contrary.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson claims that Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have implemented or taken more than 60 actions to 'open the border' and that any executive order from Biden is only the result of pressure ahead of November.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers claim it's a 'political stunt.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jacobs_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Jacobs (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remain_in_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remain in Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/04/14/85697539-0-image-m-13_1717509515274.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

That number, while significantly lower than any figure achieved by the Biden administration, would still be higher than any year under President Trump.\n\nThe Biden order does not apply to visa holders, unaccompanied children, those with a medical emergency or imminent threat to their life, or victims of a \"severe form\" of trafficking. It also does not apply to those who use the CBP One app, which is used by about 1,500 people per day.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024 the Biden administration is averaging 217,214 southwest land border encounters per month.

That number quickly exploded in the first six months of his presidency.\n\n\"These actions are not permanent. They will be discontinued when the number of migrants who cross the border between ports of entry is low enough for America's system to safely and effectively manage border operations,\" the Biden administration wrote.\n\nThe White House boasted that the Department of State has imposed visa restrictions on several Colombian transportation companies that have been profiting from smuggling migrants.\n\nThe administration's press release also said that the Department of Homeland Security has removed or returned more than 750,000 people, which it said was more than in every fiscal year since 2010.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/biden-executive-orders-suspend-entry-of-illegal-aliens-but-only-if-border-reaches-certain-threshold-for-7-days-in-a-row.jpg?id=52377304&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C170%2C0%2C0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The rule will not apply to migrants who arrive using legal pathways.\n\nNotably, the executive order rests on a law - known as 212(f) - that allows a US president to \"suspend the entry\" of foreigners if their arrival is \"detrimental to the interests\" of the country.\n\nThe same regulation was used by the Trump administration to ban immigration and travel from several predominantly Muslim countries and to bar migrants from asylum if they were apprehended crossing into the US illegally, prompting accusations of racism.\n\nWhat Trump did: In January 2019, the Trump administration implemented a policy - officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP - that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US immigration hearings.\n\nAbout 70,000 people were returned to Mexico under the policy. They were often left there for months at a time and sometimes preyed upon by criminal gangs.\n\nHuman Rights First, a charity organisation, estimated that more than 1,500 migrants were kidnapped, raped or abused after being returned to Mexico.\n\nMr Biden called the policy \"inhumane\".\n\nWhat Biden did: The administration moved to suspend Remain in Mexico on Mr Biden's first day in the White House in January 2021. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved to officially terminate the policy in June the same year.\n\nBut a ruling by a Trump-appointed federal court judge in Texas found that the administration had improperly cancelled the policy. It was restarted in December 2021.\n\nIn June 2022, the US Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, ruling it didn't violate proper administrative procedure in rescinding Remain in Mexico. The ruling allowed the policy to be terminated.\n\nWhat Trump did: Under Trump, the US government had a \"zero-tolerance\" policy that allowed authorities to deport adults who crossed the border illegally.\n\nIn some cases parents were deported back to their home countries without their children, who were placed in government custody.\n\nTrump repeatedly defended - and continues to defend - the policy as a way to deter would-be migrants.\n\nAt least 3,900 children were separated from their parents between 2017 and 2021.\n\nWhat Biden did: Mr Biden reversed the practice and some families - but not all - have been reunited.\n\nWhile a task force has reunited most families, as of April 2024 nearly 1,400 children were still waiting - although about 300 of them were in the process of being reunited or their families had been contacted.\n\nIn December 2021, the administration also moved to stop holding families in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.\n\nBiden administration officials have noted that the president's new executive order includes exemptions for unaccompanied children and those suspected of being trafficked.\n\nThe Biden administration has also rolled out family reunification programmes for citizens of certain countries - including Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Colombia - who have relatives in the US.", "source": {"uri":

According to the New York Times, \"Polls suggest growing support, even inside the president's party, for border measures that once Democrats denounced and Mr. Trump championed.\"\n\nThe news has been met with mixed feedback. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) told Axios, \"I've been briefed on the pending executive order. I certainly support it because I've been advocating for these measures for years. While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far.\"\n\nLee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney who specializes in immigration cases, however, said that this executive order could be met with legal action: \"We will need to see the EO before making any litigation decisions.... [A]ny policy that effectively ends asylum protection for people fleeing danger would raise significant legal problems, as it did when Trump tried to end asylum.\"\n\nBiden's efforts to secure the border may not be that restrictive in practice.

The illegal crossings would have to dip below 1,500 per day for the asylum restrictions to be lifted, one of the sources said.\n\nThe restrictions are not expected to apply to unaccompanied minors. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe election-year move is expected to trigger legal challenges from immigrant and civil rights groups who have criticized Biden, a Democrat, for adopting hardline policies that mirror those of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for voting-age Americans in the run-up to Nov. 5 elections where he will face Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest.\n\nBiden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Trump's restrictive policies but grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing illegally. Trump has criticized Biden for rolling back his policies and vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if reelected.\n\nThe new U.S. restrictions mirror a Biden-backed Senate bill that aimed to block migrants from claiming asylum if the number of migrants caught crossing illegally reached a certain level. The bill was crafted by a bipartisan group of senators but Republicans rejected it after Trump came out in opposition.\n\nThe number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally dropped in recent months, a trend U.S. officials partly attribute to increased Mexican enforcement.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum was elected as Mexico's first female president in a landslide victory on Sunday and will take office on Oct. 1. Biden's border restrictions could put pressure on Sheinbaum, the successor to current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to keep illegal border crossings down.\n\n(Reporting by Ted Hesson and Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Mica Rosenberg and Alistair Bell)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

In a defensive and, at times, combative interview with Time Magazine , the president insisted his age is not a problem going into the 2024 election even though he would be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nWhile Biden is expected to issue an executive order this week to shut down the border once crossings reach 4,000 per day, he still claims his previous actions on illegal immigration have not exacerbated the ongoing crisis. Besides inflation and the economy, immigration often tops the list of biggest issues for Americans ahead of November's presidential election. But Biden faces another uphill battle - his age.\n\nPolls in recent months continue to portray that voters think the current president is too old or mentally and physically unfit for another four years in office. If elected for a second term, Biden would beat his own record set three-and-a-half-years ago by being the oldest president ever elected to office. 'You are 81 years old, and would be 86 by the time you left office,' Washington Bureau Chief Massimo Calabresi and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs posed in their interview with Biden published online on Tuesday.\n\n'Large majorities of Americans, including in the Democratic Party, tell pollsters they think you are too old to lead. Could you really do this job as an 85-year old man?' they asked. 'I can do it better than anybody you know,' the presumed 2024 Democratic candidate replied before challenging: 'You're looking at me, I can take you too.' 'Did you consider not running again because of your age?'\n\nHe replied: 'No, I didn't.' 'And what do you say to Americans who are worried about it?' they followed-up. 'Watch me,' Biden said. 'Look, name me a president that's gotten as much done as I've gotten done in my first three and a half years.'\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 8 million illegal immigrants crossed the southern border since Biden took office in January 2021, and some estimates put the number of undocumented migrants living in the U.S. at more than 20 million. 'Another of your first acts as President under the banner of value-based leadership was to lift various punitive Trump-era immigration measures, Mr. President, that you and others said were inhumane. In retrospect, do you think those humanitarian moves helped drive record illegal border crossing?'\n\nBiden shot back with: 'No.' 'Were you wrong to lift any of those measures?' they pressed. 'If I was wrong, it's because I took too long,' the president replied. But it didn't take Biden long to implement changes to policies that were enacted by former President Trump during his four years in office.\n\nIn fact, on Day One of his presidency, Biden announced he was taking at least five actions related to immigration and the southern border - including ending construction of the border wall and reopening immigration of migrants from countries seen as hostile to the U.S.\n\nSince becoming president, Biden also ended Trump's Remain in Mexico policy and Title 42, which was a pandemic-era policy that allowed for more immediate deportation of illegal immigrants during a public health emergency. Biden told Time he is not examining reinstating Trump's so-called Remain in Mexico program despite reports to the contrary.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson claims that Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have implemented or taken more than 60 actions to 'open the border' and that any executive order from Biden is only the result of pressure ahead of November. Other Republican lawmakers claim it's a 'political stunt.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

It would immediately send them back to their country of origin to wait until the daily average goes down and, once it goes down, they would be able to claim asylum, according to a source familiar.\n\nThe daily number of encounters has to hit 2,500 for the provision to kick in, according to sources briefed on the situation, meaning that one day of more than 2,500 migrants would trigger the provision of limiting asylum at the border.\n\nIn recent days, members of Congress have been briefed on the executive action, according to sources familiar with the briefings.\n\nRepublican lawmakers on Tuesday, ahead of the expected announcement, were highly critical of the decision -- despite their repeated calls for Biden to use his authority to address the surge of migrants after the GOP tanked a more comprehensive bipartisan border bill at former President Donald Trump's direction.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson pointed to Biden's own statement back in January that he'd \"done all I can do\" with regard to presidential power on the issue.\n\n\"Now suddenly he wants to issue some weak executive order,\" Johnson said at his weekly press conference with other GOP leaders. \"It's window dressing. Everyone knows it.\"\n\nAcross the Capitol, a group of Republican senators gathered for their own news conference to similarly blast the executive action as \"too little too late.\"\n\n\"It is a shell game. They are not serious about it,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn. \"This is a conversion baked on the proximity of the next election and sinking poll numbers. And we think it deserves to be called out for what it is.\"\n\nJohnson was pressed by a reporter about their opposition to Biden's decision, asking the speaker why no limit would be better than the limit Biden is seeking to implement.\n\n\"Limits are fine but it's not going to solve the problem,\" Johnson claimed.\n\nAny executive order, administration officials caution, would be challenged in court.\n\n\"I anticipate that if the president would take executive action, and whatever that executive action would entail, it will be challenged in the court,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters last month at Department of Homeland Security headquarters.\n\nMayorkas and other members of the administration have urged Congress to pass the bipartisan border bill that was negotiated and proposed earlier this year.\n\nA spokesperson for Brownsville, Texas, Mayor John Cowen confirmed to ABC News that the White House invited him to a meeting at the White House on Tuesday for an immigration-related announcement, and he will be attending.\n\nEl Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser also confirmed he is attending. He told ABC News in a statement: \"El Paso is a welcoming community, and that makes me very proud, but no community can continue the effort and resources we've expended on this humanitarian crisis endlessly. We are appreciative of the funding we have received from the federal government so that our efforts don't fall on the backs of El Paso taxpayers, but our immigration system is broken, and it is critical that Congress work on a bipartisan long-term plan to work with other countries in order to create a more manageable, humane and sustainable immigration system for our country.\n\n\"I look forward to hearing more about the president's plan on Tuesday, and we stand ready to work with our partners at the local, state and federal level on this effort,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

This aggressive move comes after bipartisan legislation failed. The order aims to control border encounters, but its implementation remains uncertain, particularly concerning cooperation with Mexico.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is on the verge of signing an executive order that will halt asylum requests at the US-Mexico border once the average number of daily encounters reaches 2,500, reopening only when it declines to 1,500. According to multiple sources, this move marks Biden's most aggressive unilateral attempt yet to manage border numbers.\n\nAnnounced at the White House on Tuesday, the action follows legislative failures, primarily due to Republican opposition. Key officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and legislative affairs director Shuwanza Goff, briefed lawmakers about the plan. However, questions linger regarding how the order will work, especially with the need for Mexican collaboration.\n\nBiden's executive action follows a period of deliberation amid declining illegal crossings, partly due to Mexican efforts. The move is designed to curb a potential surge in encounters as the November elections approach. Yet, critics within Biden's own party argue that the solution is incomplete and demand more comprehensive cooperation with Latin American countries to address migration roots.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuwanza_Goff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shuwanza Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_09_52_50_9661367.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Over the past three years, while Congress has failed to act, the President has acted to secure our border. His Administration has deployed the most agents and officers ever to address the situation at the Southern border, seized record levels of illicit fentanyl at our ports of entry, and brought together world leaders on a framework to deal with changing migration patterns that are impacting the entire Western Hemisphere.\n\nEarlier this year, the President and his team reached a historic bipartisan agreement with Senate Democrats and Republicans to deliver the most consequential reforms of America's immigration laws in decades. This agreement would have added critical border and immigration personnel, invested in technology to catch illegal fentanyl, delivered sweeping reforms to the asylum system, and provided emergency authority for the President to shut down the border when the system is overwhelmed. But Republicans in Congress chose to put partisan politics ahead of our national security, twice voting against the toughest and fairest set of reforms in decades.\n\nPresident Biden believes we must secure our border. That is why today, he announced executive actions to bar migrants who cross our Southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. These actions will be in effect when high levels of encounters at the Southern Border exceed our ability to deliver timely consequences, as is the case today. They will make it easier for immigration officers to remove those without a lawful basis to remain and reduce the burden on our Border Patrol agents.\n\nBut we must be clear: this cannot achieve the same results as Congressional action, and it does not provide the critical personnel and funding needed to further secure our Southern border. Congress still must act.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration's executive actions will:\n\nBar Migrants Who Cross the Southern Border Unlawfully From Receiving Asylum\n\nRecent Actions to secure our border and address our broken immigration system:\n\nStrengthening the Asylum Screening Process\n\nAnnounced new actions to more quickly resolve immigration cases\n\nRevoked visas of CEOs and government officials who profit from migrants coming to the U.S. unlawfully", "source": {"uri": "whitehouse.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "The White House"}, "authors": [{"uri": "white_house@whitehouse.gov", "name": "White House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Hemisphere"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wh_social-share.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

And, he's going to.\n\nNews dropped earlier today that the Biden administration is preparing executive action to curb illegal crossings at the border - though the details are not quite clear as differing reports suggest different policies. Overall, however, Biden's move seems to clearly be a political response to a campaign issue.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden Expected to Sign Executive Order to Seal the Border and Restrict Asylum\n\nHowever, the Biden administration's weakness on the border has several of his Senate allies worried, and while the White House has invited Democratic Senators to join Biden for an event where he'll announce his new executive actions, we're now getting reports that some of those colleagues - the ones in swing states - might be planning to skip.\n\nSeveral Democrats in competitive Senate races declined President Biden's invitation to join him Tuesday at the White House when he announces drastic new action, meant to crack down on illegal border crossings, Axios has learned.\n\nWhy it matters: Lawmakers in swing states have pushed for stricter border rules, but some may keep the president at arms length as they consistently poll better than him in their states.\n\nSome of those Senators cited scheduling conflicts, but the overall message seems to be clear: You're hurting us.\n\nThe Biden plan will mirror the rejected \"bipartisan deal\" from earlier this year, a deal that ended up being flatly rejected by Republicans because it does not close the border. Instead, the action will restrict border crossings after asylum claims reach a certain threshold.\n\nThat won't fly with Republicans, who claim that there have already been too many crossings and the Biden administration has been flagrantly ignoring immigration law as it stands.\n\nThe fact that vulnerable Democrats in the Senate feel as though their own president is a drag on their poll numbers is a very bad sign for the incumbent president, who himself is up for re-election this year. They are looking out for their own re-elections and don't see how supporting Biden's re-election strategies benefit them, which is an indication that they believe he is toxic.\n\nOf course, there is a chance that this is all really just a series of scheduling conflicts, but all of the above-named Senators are in vulnerable states, and it seems that all of them are polling better in their own states than Biden.\n\nIt puts them - and Biden - in a difficult position when they can't be seen with him. Biden, more than any other incumbent in recent memory, desperately needs to show party unity right now. There are a lot of signs his party's members don't have faith in him. They also need to show their voters that they believe in the work Biden is doing, in order to encourage the maximum number of Democrat voters to turn out in November.\n\nBut if they are looking at the data and determining they can do it without (if not outright in spite of) Biden, then he must be extremely vulnerable in those states.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_cunningham@redstate.com", "name": "Joe Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration to the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/141/c39b5e8c-01f7-4057-b860-cb7533815f69.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The Democratic president has contemplated unilateral action for months, especially after the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal in Congress that most Republican lawmakers rejected at the behest of Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That means Biden's order should go into effect immediately, because that figure is higher than the daily averages now. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after the daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day between ports of entry, under a seven-day average. Those figures were first reported by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nOnce this order is in effect, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants would face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S., as well as potential criminal prosecution.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who expresses that fear or intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than what is currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It would require immigrants to return to Mexico and wait until the daily average of crossings falls.\n\n\"Honestly, there hasn't been a lot of difference between the Biden and Trump administrations on immigration policies at the border,\" Brown said.\n\nNational\n\nPresident Biden is expected to announce executive action on immigration Haley Bull, Serena Marshall, Jacob Gardenswartz 1:47 PM, Jun 03, 2024\n\nImmigration is one of the top issues voters are concerned about. More than 42,000 immigrants have come to Denver in the last year and a half. The City of Denver has spent over $70 million in taxpayer dollars to house and feed them.\n\nDenver Mayor Mike Johnston said he didn't know about the president's plans when Denver7 asked him about it Monday.\n\n\"I must confess, I've not read it,\" Johnston said. \"I just saw the news alert on my phone the same way you have.\"\n\nColorado U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper called the executive order \"severe\" but said it's \"a result of Republicans boycotting\" a bipartisan deal earlier this year.\n\n\"Our border would be far safer if Republicans weren't putting their party's campaign needs over our national security. We could've passed a bipartisan border bill to fix this crisis 118 days ago,\" said Hickenlooper. \"Today's severe executive order is a result of Republicans boycotting a bill they demanded and negotiated. President Biden is doing what he must. But we could do far more, far better if Republicans actually cared to solve the crisis.\"\n\nDenver\n\nDenver launching Work Ready program to integrate new immigrants into labor force Kristian Lopez 5:45 PM, May 16, 2024\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the crisis at the border wouldn't be fixed by an executive order.\n\n\"President Biden has engineered a wide-open southern border and is now trying to convince Americans that he wants to address the chaos he created,\" Johnson said. \"The American people know better. He intentionally created this crisis and an executive order won't change that.\"\n\nBrown said immigrants seeking asylum have a right to do so under U.S. law and she doesn't believe the executive order would hold up under legal scrutiny.\n\n\"It's not legal and I cannot imagine that it would be held up in federal court,\" said Brown.\n\nShe said while politicians play politics, she's thinking about the people forced to flee their homes who are now caught in the middle.\n\n\"I would urge people to show some compassion in the situation for people who literally have to give up everything to survive,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said.\n\n\"When he signs this executive order,\" Cruz said, \"the only question anyone should ask is, 'Why didn't you do this in 2021? Why didn't you do this in 2022? Why didn't you do this in 2023? Why don't you do this last month or the month before or the month before? How many dead bodies is enough?'\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who hosted the press conference with Cruz, said he thinks Biden has no intention of enforcing the order issued just five months before the presidential election.\n\n\"He's issued 94 executive orders since he's been president of the United States,\" he said. \"But he's waited until today to actually do what he calls effective action to the border. And my question to him is why did you wait until now, if you're serious about doing it? The simple answer is he's not serious about securing the border.\"\n\n\"This is a political cover, and the American people will not be fooled,\" Cornyn continued.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Biden has demonstrated an unwillingness to enforce the law, Cornyn said.\n\n\"The numbers of people coming across have just been unprecedented, along with the drugs that have come across that have taken the lives of 108,000 Americans including 71,000 due to fentanyl the leading cause of death among 18- to 45-year-olds,\" Cornyn said. \"And then there's the 400,000 unaccompanied children that have been placed with sponsors in the United States and simply lost by the Biden administration.\"\n\nCornyn added that former President Donald Trump told him in a phone call Tuesday morning that if elected, he will secure the border and deport hundreds of thousands of illegals.\n\n\"The only policy change that will work is to have mass deportations because people will stop coming when they see people leaving,\" he said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said the executive order displays Biden's border hypocrisy.\n\n\"For three years, President Biden told us all there is no crisis at the southern border for reasons clearly stated on the teleprompter and his plan to deal with the crisis at the border was to pretend that there wasn't a crisis at the border,\" Kennedy said.\n\nWhen the American people woke up to the crisis, Biden tried to say he didn't have the power to fix it, but the American people saw through him, and he pretended to have an epiphany and become a border hawk, Kennedy said.\n\n\"This is most one of the most cynical things that I have ever seen a politician attempt to do five months before an election,\" Kennedy added. \"It is insulting. It is cheap. ... The American people see that, and I hope I hope you do, too.\"\n\nBiden isn't addressing the crisis, he's maintaining a catastrophe, Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., argued. Biden discarded Trump-era border policies, which brought immigration to a 40-year-low.\n\n\"He's trying to show the American people that he's taking steps, but we're not going to believe it,\" Ricketts said. \"If he were serious, he would implement the Trump-era policies that so successfully brought the numbers of illegal people crossing our border down. He is not serious.\"\n\nFrom the first day of Biden's presidency, it has been clear we have an open border, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., argued.\n\nCruz said the invasion of the southern border is the number one issue in his home state of Texas.

Nanette Barrag\u00e1n (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told reporters in the Capitol Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Democratic critics are quick to blame Republicans for sinking a bipartisan immigration reform package earlier in the year at the behest of former President Trump, saying GOP leaders denied Biden the resources to address the border crisis in a more orderly -- and humane -- way.\n\nBut they're also voicing strong reservations with Biden's coming executive order, which is expected to put a new cap on daily crossings for asylum seekers, set at 2,500, and close the border to additional applicants afterwards.\n\nRep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) invoked the tragic case of the St. Louis, a German ship carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees out of Nazi Germany in 1939 only to be denied entry into the United States. The ship was forced to return to Europe, where more than 200 were killed in the Holocaust.\n\n\"Republicans haven't shown any good faith efforts to really solve the crisis and to authorize the president with the resources that he needs. I think we need more resources towards immigration officers [and] judges,\" Takano said. \"But I'm very troubled by a movement away from our country being a sanctuary for people who have credible fear of persecution.\"\n\nTakano, a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, also questioned whether Biden has the authority to cap the number of daily asylum seekers without congressional action.\n\n\"He's asserting authorities that I don't think he has,\" Takano said. \"And we'll see how this moves its way through the courts.\"\n\nThe pushback highlights the difficulties facing Biden and other Democratic leaders as they scramble to manage the thousands of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border each day. Republicans, including Trump, have bashed the administration for doing too little to address the crisis, and polls indicate that border security concerns rank high on voters' minds, making the issue a material liability for the president as he seeks another term in office.\n\nBarrag\u00e1n said she and other members of the Hispanic Caucus had huddled with the president in recent weeks to propose their own list of potential executive actions Biden could take on immigration and border policy, including new rights for undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for an extended period of time. She said she's holding out hope that Biden's formal unveiling of his new asylum policy, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, will feature some of those other actions.\n\n\"We think it needs to be paired with positive actions and protections for undocumenteds, folks that have been here for a long time,\" she said.\n\nThe criticisms have created a dilemma for Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, caught between supporting their ally in the White House while paying regard to the concerns of members in their own caucus.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) seemed to be straddling that divide Tuesday morning ahead of Biden's rollout.\n\n\"It's important that President Biden is planning to take decisive action given the fact that extreme MAGA Republicans have decided to try to weaponize the issue of the challenges at the border, as opposed to solving the issue legislatively,\" Jeffries said.\n\nPressed on the wisdom of setting a limit on asylum seekers, Jeffries declined to comment.\n\n\"I will reserve any further comment until after I hear the president publicly articulate to the American people the reasons why he is taking these actions,\" he said.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), the senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said he supports a system where anyone being persecuted at home can seek asylum in the United States, warning that closing the border is a dangerous move, not least because it could harm local border economies. But he also bashed Republicans for opposing legislative solutions for fixing America's broken immigration system, which GOP leaders killed earlier in the year after Trump came out against a fix.\n\n\"They don't want the issue to be resolved and solved. They want this to just be a political issue,\" Meeks said.\n\n\"The responsibility lies on us in Congress,\" he added. \"The president feels right now that he has no other alternative.\"", "source":

The White House stated in an official release that these \"actions will be in effect when the high levels of encounters at the Southern Border exceed the capacity to generate timely consequences, as is the case on this June 4th.\"\n\nThe administration claims that the measures authorized by Biden will make it easier for immigration officers to expel those migrants who do not have a legal basis to stay in the United States. This is expected to reduce the burden on Border Patrol agents.\n\nThe Biden Administration cautions that Congress still needs to act to resolve the immigration issue at the border with Mexico, as the president's actions do not provide the necessary personnel or funding to secure the situation.\n\nThe first action is to ban immigrants who illegally cross the southern border from receiving asylum. President Biden issued a proclamation under sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act suspending the entry of non-citizens who cross the border illegally.\n\nThis is accompanied by an interim final rule from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, which restricts asylum for those non-citizens. The rule will be in effect when the southern border is overwhelmed and will facilitate the rapid expulsion of individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States.\n\nThe Biden Administration clarifies that these actions are not permanent and will be suspended when the number of migrants crossing the border between ports of entry is low enough for the U.S. system to manage border operations safely and effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the actions include humanitarian exceptions similar to those in the bipartisan border agreement announced in the Senate, such as cases involving unaccompanied children and trafficking victims.\n\n1. Strengthening Asylum Screening Process\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security published a proposed rule to ensure that migrants posing a public or national security risk are expelled as quickly as possible in the process rather than remaining in prolonged and costly detention before their expulsion.\n\n2. Accelerating Immigration Case Resolution\n\nThe Departments of Justice and Homeland Security launched a docket for recent arrivals to more quickly resolve immigration cases of migrants attempting to cross between ports of entry at the southern border in violation of the law. The Department of Justice will be able to address these cases more swiftly, and Homeland Security will be able to expel more individuals who do not have a legal basis to remain in the U.S. while granting protection to those with valid claims.\n\n3. Visa Revocations for Executives and Officials Benefiting from Illegal Immigration\n\nThe Department of State imposed visa restrictions on executives of various Colombian transport companies profiting from the trafficking of migrants by sea. This action targets companies that facilitate illegal entry into the U.S. and sends a clear message that no one should benefit from the exploitation of vulnerable migrants.\n\nThe State Department also imposed visa restrictions on over 250 members of the Nicaraguan government, non-governmental actors, and their immediate family members for supporting the Ortega-Murillo regime, which is selling transit visas to migrants in and out of the West. The Department revoked visas from charter airline executives for similar actions.\n\n4. Expanded Efforts to Dismantle Human Trafficking and Support Immigration Processes\n\nThe Departments of State and Justice launched a \"Rewards for Smuggling\" initiative designed to dismantle the leadership of human trafficking organizations bringing migrants through Central America and the southern U.S. border. The initiative will offer financial rewards for information leading to the identification, location, arrest, or conviction of key figures in significant human trafficking activities in the region.\n\nThe Department of Justice will seek new and greater penalties against human traffickers to adequately account for the severity of their criminal conduct and the human misery it causes. The Justice Department is also partnering with the Department of Homeland Security to direct additional prosecutors and support staff to enhance immigration-related prosecutions in critical federal border district offices.\n\nEfforts include deploying additional special assistant U.S. attorneys from DHS to various federal prosecutor's offices, assigning support staff to critical U.S. attorney's offices, including DOJ attorneys to provide details in federal prosecutor offices in several border districts, and partnering with federal agencies to identify additional resources to combat these crimes.\n\n5. Enhancing Immigration Law Enforcement\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has deployed agents to the southern border and is referring a record number of individuals for expedited removal. DHS is operating more repatriation flights per week than ever before. Last year, DHS expelled or returned more than 750,000 individuals, more than in any fiscal year since 2010.\n\n6. Seizing Fentanyl\n\nThe President has added 40 drug detection machines at entry points to disrupt fentanyl smuggling into the national territory. The Biden Administration asserts it is working with the Mexican government on these sensitive issues at the border.\n\nThe release mentioned that recently, the Department of Justice extradited N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salaz, known as \"El Nini,\" from Mexico to the United States to face charges for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and human rights abuses.", "source": {"uri":

It's hard for me to forget that,\" Salinas said. \"As much as I want to support [Biden] -- and by no means am I a Republican -- but he's been saying that Congress does it, and now you're doing something about it without Congress. Why couldn't he do it before? One-hundred percent, it's politically driven.\"\n\nThe White House is expected to announce an executive order Tuesday that effectively shuts down the U.S.-Mexico border to illegal immigration. Under the Biden administration, nearly 10 million non-U.S. citizens have been encountered attempting to enter the United States.\n\nThe White House has not yet publicly disclosed details of the order, but it is expected to resemble a Senate proposal that House Republicans came out against earlier this year.\n\nThe order would affect adult immigrants who cross the border and seek asylum.

If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nBiden's order was detailed by four senior administration officials who insisted on anonymity to describe the effort to reporters. The directive is coming when the number of migrants encountered at the border have been on a consistent decline since December, but senior administration officials nonetheless justified the order by arguing that the numbers are still too high and that the figures could spike in better weather, when the encounter numbers traditionally increase.\n\nYet many questions and complications remain about how Biden's new directive would be implemented.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration already has an agreement with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to accept up to 30,000 citizens a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela once they are denied entry from the U.S., and senior administration officials say that will continue under this order. But it is unclear what happens to nationals of other countries who are denied under Biden's directive.\n\nSenior officials also acknowledged that the administration's goal of deporting migrants quickly is complicated by insufficient funding from Congress to do so. The administration also faces certain legal constraints when it comes to detaining migrant families, although the administration said it would continue to abide by those obligations.\n\nThe legal authority being invoked by Biden comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if it's deemed \"detrimental\" to the national interest. Senior officials expressed confidence that they would be able to implement Biden's order, despite threats from prominent legal groups to sue the administration over the directive.\n\nThe senior administration officials insisted that Biden's proposal differs dramatically from that of Trump, who leaned on the same provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Biden is using, including his 2017 directive to bar citizens of Muslim-majority nations and his efforts in 2018 to clamp down on asylum.\n\nFor instance, Biden's order outlines several groups of migrants who would be exempted due to humanitarian reasons, including victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies.\n\nThe directive would also exempt migrants who arrive in what senior officials called an orderly fashion, which includes people who make appointments with border officials at ports of entry using the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app. About 1,450 appointments are made a day using the app, which launched last year.\n\nAverage daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico were last below 2,500 in January 2021, the month that Biden took office. The last time the border encounters dipped to 1,500 a day was in July 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCongressional Republicans, who almost all rejected the Senate's bipartisan border proposal earlier this year, dismissed Biden's order as nothing more than a \"political stunt\" meant to show toughened immigration enforcement ahead of the election.\n\n\"He tried to convince us all for all this time that there was no way he could possibly fix the mess,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a news conference. \"Remember that he engineered it.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated

It's hard for me to forget that,\" Salinas said. \"As much as I want to support [Biden] -- and by no means am I a Republican -- but he's been saying that Congress does it, and now you're doing something about it without Congress. Why couldn't he do it before? One-hundred percent, it's politically driven.\"\n\nThe White House is expected to announce an executive order Tuesday that effectively shuts down the U.S.-Mexico border to illegal immigration. Under the Biden administration, nearly 10 million non-U.S. citizens have been encountered attempting to enter the United States.\n\nThe White House has not yet publicly disclosed details of the order, but it is expected to resemble a Senate proposal that House Republicans came out against earlier this year.\n\nThe order would affect adult immigrants who cross the border and seek asylum. The changes are expected to be in line with limitations that were floated earlier this year in a Senate legislative package that ultimately failed to gain Republican support.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIt could limit the number of immigrants who seek asylum at the ports of entry, though limitations on immigrants who cross between the ports remain unclear.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The action would be discontinued two weeks after the government determined that the daily average of migrant encounters has fallen below 1,500 for seven consecutive days.\n\nCurrently, the average number of encounters with migrants is roughly 4,000 per day, Department of Homeland Security officials told NBC News.\n\nAs a result, a senior administration official told reporters the temporary ban will be \"in effect immediately.\"\n\nThe temporary shutdown would not block trade or travel, however. And it would still allow immigrants who enter the United States legally to apply for and receive asylum.\n\nBut economists and industry representatives say the action has potential impacts on the U.S. labor market, trade, supply chains and inflation.\n\n\"This is a modest move as far as immigration changes go, so I think it would have only a small effect on job growth and economic expansion,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, economics director at Yale University's Budget Lab. Tedeschi formerly served as chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors.\n\nThe order is also designed to serve as Biden's political response to public anger over a wave of undocumented immigrants. This frustration has become a voter liability ahead of Biden's likely November rematch against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut border policy also impacts the way that businesses trade, hire workers and price consumer goods -- all of which bears on the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nSo far, experts say the short-term economic impacts will be relatively small-scale. Specifically, the new asylum limits could put a gentle dent in U.S. labor market growth. But they might also help unclog supply chain bottlenecks at the border and streamline trade with Mexico.\n\nIf the new border measure bruises the economy at all, experts say the pain point will likely present in the labor market.\n\nIf the border temporarily stops accepting new asylum seekers under Biden's executive order, the immigration slowdown could mildly dent the strong U.S. labor market, which has already showed signs of softening.\n\n\"I'd expect [job] numbers to cool a tiny bit,\" Tedeschi said. \"I'd also expect many immeasurable effects: say, a business finding it a bit harder to find the workers they need to open a new location.\"\n\nSince 2019, immigration has added 2 million workers to the U.S. labor supply, according to an April analysis by Tedeschi. Without immigrants, Tedeschi estimated that the size of the U.S. labor supply would have shrunk by 1.2 million during that period.\n\n\"A steady influx of immigrants is critical to ensuring the U.S. labor force can continue to grow,\" said Brookings Institution economist Tara Watson.\n\nImmigrants also helped supercharge the U.S.' post-pandemic economic recovery, which has outpaced developed nations around the world, despite its many hiccups.\n\nTedeschi approximated that immigrants accounted for one-fifth of the pandemic growth in U.S. gross domestic product.\n\nThe short answer is that this executive order will probably not increase inflation.\n\n\"Immigration has an ambiguous effect on inflation, since immigrants expand supply but also bring added demand as well,\" Tedeschi explained.\n\nSome experts say the executive order could actually bring down costs by smoothing out the U.S.-Mexico supply chain.\n\nShipping at the border sometimes gets clogged because Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, agents get tied up trying to process an overwhelming number of migrants.\n\n\"When you slow down that logistics chain, it costs everybody money,\" said Jerry Pacheco, president of the Border Industrial Association, a New Mexico trade group that represents over 100 businesses that rely on Mexican producers.\n\nThese elevated producer costs can ripple through the entire economy.\n\n\"It's like a hot potato. It's passed on from the logistics companies to manufacturers and manufacturers pass it on to us, consumers. That has a profound negative impact on on our economy,\" Pacheco said.\n\nBiden's executive order could help clear some of these supply chain bottlenecks. By placing limits on the number of migrant crossings, CBP agents would have more time to facilitate faster shipping with Mexico.\n\n\"This probably should have been done a year ago, two years ago,\" Pacheco said.\n\nDespite some of the potential economic silver linings of Biden's border policy, Pacheco said the best border policy for the economy and the labor force would be one that provides a long-term fix to the nation's \"broken immigration and visa system.\"\n\nWatson, of Brookings, agreed. \"The better way to manage the border situation would be to create more regular legal pathways,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Biden's new executive order is expected to have both milder economic and humanitarian effects than the wholesale border shutdown and hardline deportation strategies that Trump and some Republicans are proposing.\n\nExperts say draconian immigration policies could stoke the embers of inflation that the Biden administration has been working to stamp out.\n\n\"I used to always chuckle when former President Trump would say that,\" Pacheco quipped, referring to Trump's pledge to shut down the border.\n\n\"I mean, that would be like taking a shotgun, not a pistol, and shooting ourselves in the kneecap.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CNBC on how Trump's immigration proposals would impact inflation and the cost of goods.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)",

The action would be discontinued two weeks after the government determined that the daily average of migrant encounters has fallen below 1,500 for seven consecutive days.\n\nCurrently, the average number of encounters with migrants is roughly 4,000 per day, Department of Homeland Security officials told NBC News.\n\nAs a result, a senior administration official told reporters the temporary ban will be \"in effect immediately.\"\n\nThe temporary shutdown would not block trade or travel, however. And it would still allow immigrants who enter the United States legally to apply for and receive asylum.\n\nBut economists and industry representatives say the action has potential impacts on the U.S. labor market, trade, supply chains and inflation.\n\n\"This is a modest move as far as immigration changes go, so I think it would have only a small effect on job growth and economic expansion,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, economics director at Yale University's Budget Lab. Tedeschi formerly served as chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors.\n\nThe order is also designed to serve as Biden's political response to public anger over a wave of undocumented immigrants. This frustration has become a voter liability ahead of Biden's likely November rematch against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut border policy also impacts the way that businesses trade, hire workers and price consumer goods -- all of which bears on the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nSo far, experts say the short-term economic impacts will be relatively small-scale. Specifically, the new asylum limits could put a gentle dent in U.S. labor market growth. But they might also help unclog supply chain bottlenecks at the border and streamline trade with Mexico.\n\nIf the new border measure bruises the economy at all, experts say the pain point will likely present in the labor market.\n\nIf the border temporarily stops accepting new asylum seekers under Biden's executive order, the immigration slowdown could mildly dent the strong U.S. labor market, which has already showed signs of softening.\n\n\"I'd expect [job] numbers to cool a tiny bit,\" Tedeschi said. \"I'd also expect many immeasurable effects: say, a business finding it a bit harder to find the workers they need to open a new location.\"\n\nSince 2019, immigration has added 2 million workers to the U.S. labor supply, according to an April analysis by Tedeschi. Without immigrants, Tedeschi estimated that the size of the U.S. labor supply would have shrunk by 1.2 million during that period.\n\n\"A steady influx of immigrants is critical to ensuring the U.S. labor force can continue to grow,\" said Brookings Institution economist Tara Watson.\n\nImmigrants also helped supercharge the U.S.' post-pandemic economic recovery, which has outpaced developed nations around the world, despite its many hiccups.\n\nTedeschi approximated that immigrants accounted for one-fifth of the pandemic growth in U.S. gross domestic product.\n\nThe short answer is that this executive order will probably not increase inflation.\n\n\"Immigration has an ambiguous effect on inflation, since immigrants expand supply but also bring added demand as well,\" Tedeschi explained.\n\nSome experts say the executive order could actually bring down costs by smoothing out the U.S.-Mexico supply chain.\n\nShipping at the border sometimes gets clogged because Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, agents get tied up trying to process an overwhelming number of migrants.\n\n\"When you slow down that logistics chain, it costs everybody money,\" said Jerry Pacheco, president of the Border Industrial Association, a New Mexico trade group that represents over 100 businesses that rely on Mexican producers.\n\nThese elevated producer costs can ripple through the entire economy.\n\n\"It's like a hot potato. It's passed on from the logistics companies to manufacturers and manufacturers pass it on to us, consumers. That has a profound negative impact on on our economy,\" Pacheco said.\n\nBiden's executive order could help clear some of these supply chain bottlenecks. By placing limits on the number of migrant crossings, CBP agents would have more time to facilitate faster shipping with Mexico.\n\n\"This probably should have been done a year ago, two years ago,\" Pacheco said.\n\nDespite some of the potential economic silver linings of Biden's border policy, Pacheco said the best border policy for the economy and the labor force would be one that provides a long-term fix to the nation's \"broken immigration and visa system.\"\n\nWatson, of Brookings, agreed. \"The better way to manage the border situation would be to create more regular legal pathways,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Biden's new executive order is expected to have both milder economic and humanitarian effects than the wholesale border shutdown and hardline deportation strategies that Trump and some Republicans are proposing.\n\nExperts say draconian immigration policies could stoke the embers of inflation that the Biden administration has been working to stamp out.\n\n\"I used to always chuckle when former President Trump would say that,\" Pacheco quipped, referring to Trump's pledge to shut down the border.\n\n\"I mean, that would be like taking a shotgun, not a pistol, and shooting ourselves in the kneecap.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CNBC on how Trump's immigration proposals would impact inflation and the cost of goods.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An immigration scholar explains why - and it's not for the reasons that some GOP lawmakers claim", "body": "College of Charleston provides funding as a member of The Conversation US.\n\nAs debate over U.S. immigration policy heats up during the 2024 presidential campaign, separating fact from fiction on the U.S.-Mexico border becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nIn May 2023, shortly after the end of a public health restriction that allowed U.S. officials to immediately expel asylum-seekers, a team of academic and humanitarian aide colleagues and I went to the Mexican city of Matamoros, just across the Rio Grande from the banks of Brownsville, Texas.\n\nAt the time, we didn't encounter the \"invasion at the border\" that conservative lawmakers such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott predicted would happen once the COVID-19 restrictions - officially known as Title 42 - expired.\n\nFrom what we learned, the actual rush of thousands of people across the border occurred in the days before Title 42 was lifted on May 11, 2023. Many migrants told us they saw it as their last chance to cross the U.S. border.\n\nMost people we talked to were waiting in overcrowded, temporary camps in Mexico. They feared that if they tried to cross into the U.S., they would lose their opportunity to seek asylum and would be deported under restrictive polices unveiled during the Biden administration.\n\nThe situation at the border has constantly changed ever since. But the brief period when Title 42 ended is a perfect illustration of the differences between right-wing hysteria and the realities on the ground.\n\nThe evolution of US border policy\n\nSince the fall of 2019, I have been working at the Mexican border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros - across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas. That year, the Trump administration had started the Migrant Protection Protocols.\n\nKnown as \"Remain in Mexico,\" the restrictive policy ended the possibility of asylum for about 70,000 migrants, mostly from Central America. Instead, they were forced to wait in Mexico with little realistic chance of being able to legally enter and stay in the U.S. Anyone who entered the country illegally was deported immediately and barred from applying for asylum for five years.\n\nThe border became even more restrictive during the COVID-19 pandemic when Title 42 was implemented in March 2020. It limited entry into the U.S. at the border to U.S citizens and residents.\n\nTraditional ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border were closed to asylum-seekers in order to prevent the spread of COVID. For example, those who came to the ports of entry at the international bridges in Reynosa or Matamoros would be turned back at the halfway point and not allowed to touch U.S. soil.\n\nAs a result, most of the people whom we talked to in 2023 were waiting in Mexico and fearful.\n\nInside the asylum camps\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, my academic and nonprofit colleagues witnessed migrants toiling in squalid, makeshift camps.\n\nOne of the first asylum camps was formed during the last days of the Trump administration across from Brownsville, Texas, in Matamoros, Mexico. The Mexican government allowed faith-based organizations and nongovernment organizations such as Team Brownsville and Solidarity Engineering to bring in tents, food, water and other supplies.\n\nBefore long, thousands of individuals - primarily from Central America - were sleeping on the streets next to the international bridge that connected the town to Brownsville.\n\nAt one point, the camp had about 3,000 people living in it. There were only two portable toilets.\n\nA second, unofficial camp started around the same time in the city square of Reynosa, a town located across the border from Hidalgo, Texas. It also became overrun with people, making it difficult to even walk through the camp. Mothers told us stories of being unable to sleep at night because of the constant fear of sexual assault and violence.\n\nUnlike many refugee camps around the world, these camps often have very little structure, almost no security and little organization. Though there are some portable toilets and, at times, makeshift showers, sanitation is a serious issue. Many people bathe in the nearby Rio Grande.\n\nFood is scarce. Every so often, churches and nonprofit relief groups provide some aid. But it is never enough to meet the demand.\n\nThe most serious issue for those staying at the camps is protection from organized crime and drug cartels. Families with young girls were especially concerned, as sexual assaults were reported in the camps.\n\nWomen were afraid to venture out at night. Out of desperation, some even sent their children across the U.S. border alone in the hope they would be allowed to stay in the U.S.\n\nAs dangerous as that journey was, they believed it was more dangerous for the children to remain in the cartel-filled camps.\n\nCritical choices\n\nThus far in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, immigration has emerged as one of the top issues among voters.\n\nIn this polarized political environment, it would be easy for those across the political spectrum to conclude that the border is chaotic and needs to be closed.\n\nIn my view, closing the border permanently - as former President Donald Trump and other right-wing lawmakers have sought to do - would be a mistake and not in the best interests of national security, the U.S. economy and, ultimately, the lives of asylum-seekers.\n\nAs a researcher who has spent countless hours with asylum-seekers and other migrants, I believe that restrictive policies - from either Trump or Biden - are helpful only to organized crime, which is often controlling immigration on the ground along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThis often puts asylum-seekers in great danger, both from direct violence from the cartels and from the harsh terrain they must traverse to avoid detection by immigration officials.\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House or U.S. President Joe Biden chooses to take a harsher stance, more restrictive border policies could force people who have already fled their homelands to either stay in cartel-controlled camps or risk dying trying to enter the U.S. illegally.",

That number would have to remain below a daily average of 1,500 for seven days in order for the border to fully re-open for asylum seekers. Current averages are above that threshold.\n\nEagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas, whose city experienced an influx of migrants for months last year, said he welcomed any new policy limiting illegal crossings. But he questioned why the president did not take executive action last year amid record migration or in response to Salinas' pleas to the federal government for help.\n\nSalinas said he was not invited to the White House like mayors from some other Texas border cities who will join Biden for an announcement of the new policy.\n\n\"If he could have done this all along why didn't he do this last year when our city got slammed -- they closed the bridge, businesses were hurting, our first responders were struggling,\" Salinas said Tuesday morning. \"Why now?\"\n\nTexas Sens. John Cornyn and Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republicans, blasted the executive order.\n\n\"It's a fig leaf. He has absolutely no intention of actually enforcing any of this. If he did, he would have enforced the law -- as we've heard time and time again -- at the beginning of his administration,\" Cornyn said. \"This is not an improvement. This is a fig leaf and I think the American people are not going to be fooled.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that provides legal services to migrants in west Texas and Mexico, said she was concerned about what the order could portend for vulnerable migrants if it does not create safer, legal options for migrating.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of confusion among people about how to enter. I think we're going to see more people forced into trafficking routes,\" Babaie said. \"It's just danger to women, children and the LGBTQ community that we serve. I mean those are the number one groups of people that we're screening in Ju\u00e1rez, many have been waiting for months [to enter the U.S.].\"\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated.",

The action would be discontinued two weeks after the government determined that the daily average of migrant encounters has fallen below 1,500 for seven consecutive days.\n\nCurrently, the average number of encounters with migrants is roughly 4,000 per day, Department of Homeland Security officials told NBC News.\n\nAs a result, a senior administration official told reporters the temporary ban will be \"in effect immediately.\"\n\nThe temporary shutdown would not block trade or travel, however. And it would still allow immigrants who enter the United States legally to apply for and receive asylum.\n\nBut economists and industry representatives say the action has potential impacts on the U.S. labor market, trade, supply chains and inflation.\n\n\"This is a modest move as far as immigration changes go, so I think it would have only a small effect on job growth and economic expansion,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, economics director at Yale University's Budget Lab. Tedeschi formerly served as chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisors.\n\nThe order is also designed to serve as Biden's political response to public anger over a wave of undocumented immigrants. This frustration has become a voter liability ahead of Biden's likely November rematch against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut border policy also impacts the way that businesses trade, hire workers and price consumer goods -- all of which bears on the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nSo far, experts say the short-term economic impacts will be relatively small-scale. Specifically, the new asylum limits could put a gentle dent in U.S. labor market growth. But they might also help unclog supply chain bottlenecks at the border and streamline trade with Mexico.\n\nCould this hurt the economy?\n\nIf the new border measure bruises the economy at all, experts say the pain point will likely present in the labor market.\n\nIf the border temporarily stops accepting new asylum seekers under Biden's executive order, the immigration slowdown could mildly dent the strong U.S. labor market, which has already showed signs of softening.\n\n\"I'd expect [job] numbers to cool a tiny bit,\" Tedeschi said. \"I'd also expect many immeasurable effects: say, a business finding it a bit harder to find the workers they need to open a new location.\"\n\nSince 2019, immigration has added 2 million workers to the U.S. labor supply, according to an April analysis by Tedeschi. Without immigrants, Tedeschi estimated that the size of the U.S. labor supply would have shrunk by 1.2 million during that period.\n\n\"A steady influx of immigrants is critical to ensuring the U.S. labor force can continue to grow,\" said Brookings Institution economist Tara Watson.\n\nImmigrants also helped supercharge the U.S.' post-pandemic economic recovery, which has outpaced developed nations around the world, despite its many hiccups.\n\nTedeschi approximated that immigrants accounted for one-fifth of the pandemic growth in U.S. gross domestic product.\n\nWill goods get more expensive?\n\nThe short answer is that this executive order will probably not increase inflation.\n\n\"Immigration has an ambiguous effect on inflation, since immigrants expand supply but also bring added demand as well,\" Tedeschi explained.\n\nSome experts say the executive order could actually bring down costs by smoothing out the U.S.-Mexico supply chain.\n\nShipping at the border sometimes gets clogged because Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, agents get tied up trying to process an overwhelming number of migrants.\n\n\"When you slow down that logistics chain, it costs everybody money,\" said Jerry Pacheco, president of the Border Industrial Association, a New Mexico trade group that represents over 100 businesses that rely on Mexican producers.\n\nThese elevated producer costs can ripple through the entire economy.\n\n\"It's like a hot potato. It's passed on from the logistics companies to manufacturers and manufacturers pass it on to us, consumers. That has a profound negative impact on on our economy,\" Pacheco said.\n\nBiden's executive order could help clear some of these supply chain bottlenecks. By placing limits on the number of migrant crossings, CBP agents would have more time to facilitate faster shipping with Mexico.\n\n\"This probably should have been done a year ago, two years ago,\" Pacheco said.\n\nThe Trump alternative\n\nDespite some of the potential economic silver linings of Biden's border policy, Pacheco said the best border policy for the economy and the labor force would be one that provides a long-term fix to the nation's \"broken immigration and visa system.\"\n\nWatson, of Brookings, agreed. \"The better way to manage the border situation would be to create more regular legal pathways,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Biden's new executive order is expected to have both milder economic and humanitarian effects than the wholesale border shutdown and hardline deportation strategies that Trump and some Republicans are proposing.\n\nExperts say draconian immigration policies could stoke the embers of inflation that the Biden administration has been working to stamp out.\n\n\"I used to always chuckle when former President Trump would say that,\" Pacheco quipped, referring to Trump's pledge to shut down the border.\n\n\"I mean, that would be like taking a shotgun, not a pistol, and shooting ourselves in the kneecap.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CNBC on how Trump's immigration proposals would impact inflation and the cost of goods.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The reversible policy accepts a border inflow of 900,000 illegal migrants per year -- even as it quietly diverts many additional southern migrants through quasi-legal border loopholes, such as \"parole.\"\n\nThe pro-Biden media is celebrating the campaign trail policy change. The announcement \"marks a striking shift in the administration toward embracing tougher measures at the border,\" Axios claimed.\n\nPro-migration groups are gearing up to display theatrical opposition to Biden's campaign trail response to his very unpopular migration policies.\n\nThe rule likely will be suspended by California's pro-migration judge, Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge who works for the Center for Immigration Studies. Biden's deputies \"expect it to be enjoined ... [and to then sign a settlement] that makes it harder for the Trump administration to use that power\" in 2025, he told Breitbart News.\n\nThe 2,500 daily intake would be lower than the 4,000 daily inflow reported in earlier media leaks.\n\nIt would add up to 75,000 migrants per month -- which is lower than the last three months' average inflow of 125,000 border migrants -- in the unlikely event it survives the California judges.\n\nBut the pending Biden 2,500-a-day curb would still allow Biden's pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, to smuggle millions of additional migrants through various quasi-legal loopholes in border law.\n\nThe loopholes include Mayorkas' refusal to detain asylum-seeking migrants and his decision to offer parole to at least 360,000 migrants flying in from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela every year. The monthly numbers also exclude so-called \"getaways\" who sneak past the poorly guarded fences and expect youth migrants who claim to be Unaccompanied Alien Children.\n\nMayorkas' southern inflow is in addition to the legal inflow of 1 million legal immigrants and roughly 1 million temporary workers each year. Since 2021, Mayorkas has welcomed roughly 10 million legal, illegal, or quasi-legal migrants -- or one migrant for every American birth -- so imposing vast pocketbook damage on ordinary Americans.\n\nBiden and Mayorkas have already outsourced much of the nation's border security to Mexico's government as they try to minimize the TV coverage of their migration flood.\n\nFor example, in January, Biden's deputies bought Mexico's promise to block more than 4,000 migrants per day from reaching the border, in a swap for welcoming more Mexican migrants. That deal has gotten little press, partly because it shows what Biden chose not to negotiate in 2021, and shows that Mexico's pro-migration government wants to help Biden get reelected in November.\n\n\"We have committed to the United States to achieve a reduction of the flow to the border, so the number does not exceed 4,000 a day,\" Mexico's foreign minister said mid-May. U.S. officials \"can manage the crossing of 4,000 people along their border, but no more than 4,000,\" Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena said as she announced Mexico's plan to regulate and direct migration through the region.\n\nOn Monday, Mexico elected a new pro-migration president, Claudia Sheinbaum. She has been very critical of President Donald Trump, saying, \"Obviously, we are always going to defend Mexicans [in the United States, and] we are not in favor of any discriminatory discourse.\"\n\nBiden's new border curbs are being touted as a way to reduce the inflow. But Mayorkas just posted regulations on May 16 that protect millions of illegal migrants from quick deportations.\n\nThe new rules \"throw sand in the gears of the removal proceedings,\" Eli Jacobs, the regulatory affairs director at the Center for Immigration Studies told Breitbart News, adding:\n\nThere are many people in the Biden administration and leadership positions who find the immigration system to be immoral as prima facie matter and want to take every policy measure they can to ensure that people are able to remain in the United States.\n\nThey've put policies in place to help mass-cancel cases while they say, \"Hey, we're working on our backlog, it's dropping.\" But in reality, if you're [a migrant] in the litigation process with the government, you will be there for a long time and [Biden's deputies] just use [the backlog] as an excuse to cancel or close cases, and [also] to issue forms of prosecutorial discretion when the alien is not eligible for any form of relief or immigration benefit.\n\nThe sand-in-the-gears regulation was announced on May 16 in a press release about another policy promising that a small minority of recent migrants would get priority in the nation's deportation and asylum courts:\n\n\"Today, we are instituting with the Department of Justice a process to accelerate asylum proceedings so that individuals who do not qualify for relief can be removed more quickly and those who do qualify can achieve protection sooner,\" said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.\n\n...\n\nIn order to support these efforts, today the Justice Department also submitted to the Federal Register a final rule titled Efficient Case and Docket Management in Immigration Proceedings. The rule codifies procedures and standards for immigration adjudicators across the country to manage their dockets and resolve cases efficiently. The rule allows adjudicators to prioritize cases that are ready to be resolved promptly, enabling them to address their caseloads more efficiently and quickly. This rule is an important step the Justice Department is taking to promote the efficient, expeditious, and fair adjudication of immigration cases, allocate limited resources more efficiently, and ensure procedural protections for parties in immigration court.\n\nThe courthouse population of migrants is somewhere between 2.8 million and 3.6 million people.\n\nThis number is a 14-fold increase over the 186,000 cases in 2008, partly because Mayorkas helped break the immigration system by allowing more migrants to avoid detention from 2011 onwards and then get the jobs they needed to pay off their smuggling debts. The cartels used this new no-detention process to reassure millions of potential migrants that it was financially safe to accept debts to coyotes and their cartel networks.\n\nMayorkas' backlog also helps encourage migrants by showing they can stay and work in the United States for several years before their first courthouse date. Many migrants this holiday from deportation to work and smuggle their children into the United States via the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) transport network jointly run by Mexico's cartels and coyotes and by Biden's federal agencies.\n\nMayorkas has also pressured judges to lay migrants stay, even when the migrants clearly do not qualify for asylum.\n\nUnder Biden, 380,000 migrants have been allowed to stay without getting asylum. Under President Donald Trump, only 25,000 migrants were allowed to stay without getting asylum.\n\nEven if denied asylum or residency, the migrants can go back to the courts to file appeals and to try additional options to get legal residency and green cards.\n\nThis resulting courthouse population of migrant workers, renters, and consumers is a windfall for employers, landlords, and retailers -- but a pocketbook and civic disaster for more than 100 million Americans who lose wages, decent homes, and access to good schools amid the flood of Biden's economic migrants.\n\nMayorkas' backlog would take more than 21 years to eliminate, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).\n\nMayorkas is also spending billions of dollars each year via progressive-run civic organizations to help millions of migrants reach the U.S. border, get settled in housing that would otherwise go to Americans, and get jobs that would otherwise go to better-paid Americans.\n\nThe practical result of Biden's Extraction Migration policy has been lower wages, higher housing costs, higher interest rates, lower productivity, and greater civic chaos for 330 million

The move is meant to pressure American manufacturers to challenge China's current practice of encouraging very low pricing for domestic EV manufacturers while they levy a 40% tariff on U.S. car imports to China.\n\nThe ramped-up tariffs on electric vehicles are a continuation of the tariffs Trump instituted during his presidency that Biden has left in place. While Trump was president, he imposed 30%-50% tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines and later imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from any country.\n\nIn a possible second Trump term, Trump is eyeing 60% tariffs on all the $427 billion worth of goods China sends the United States each year.\n\nBiden's border order\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden is expected to act unilaterally to address the border crisis after a bipartisan Senate border bill failed. Details about Biden's plan haven't been released, but it is expected that the executive order will resemble the failed bill, including allowing officials to deport migrants who enter the country illegally without processing their asylum requests once the daily limit is met.\n\n\"As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system,\" a Biden spokesperson said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBiden is leaning on authority granted to the president in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to \"suspend the entry\" of foreigners if their arrival is \"detrimental to the interests\" of the country.\n\nTrump relied on the same section when he issued his travel ban, halting immigration and travel from several majority-Muslim countries to keep migrants from crossing the U.S. border.\n\nNumerous executive orders\n\nThere are only so many ways to get something done as the president: ask Congress or do it yourself. Biden has been mirroring Trump's string of executive orders to execute his plans when a divided Congress has stopped him from acting.\n\nRelying on a flurry of executive orders to execute an agenda didn't originate with Trump. Then-President Barack Obama said, \"I've got a pen, and I've got a phone,\" when he was battling with Republicans in Congress blocking his agenda.\n\nBiden and Trump had a unified government during their first terms but faced parties that were internally fractured. Trump had to deal with defiance from the late Sen. John McCain when he tried to repeal Obamacare, while Biden has had to deal with Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Joe Manchin (I-WV), defiant Democrats who became independents.\n\nTrump issued the most executive orders of the pair, with 220, many of which were overturned by Biden in the earlier days of his presidency. Biden has issued 138 executive orders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBiden and Trump cracked down on the border in their own ways via executive order, and it is a way to advance policy in a gridlocked Congress.\n\nVia executive order, Biden has accomplished many of his policy goals, including canceling some student loan debt.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

That number would have to remain below a daily average of 1,500 for seven days in order for the border to fully re-open for asylum seekers. Current averages are above that threshold.\n\nEagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas, whose city experienced an influx of migrants for months last year, said he welcomed any new policy limiting illegal crossings. But he questioned why the president did not take executive action last year amid record migration or in response to Salinas' pleas to the federal government for help.\n\nSalinas said he was not invited to the White House like mayors from some other Texas border cities who will join Biden for an announcement of the new policy.\n\n\"If he could have done this all along why didn't he do this last year when our city got slammed -- they closed the bridge, businesses were hurting, our first responders were struggling,\" Salinas said Tuesday morning. \"Why now?\"\n\nTexas Sens. John Cornyn and Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republicans, blasted the executive order.\n\n\"It's a fig leaf. He has absolutely no intention of actually enforcing any of this. If he did, he would have enforced the law -- as we've heard time and time again -- at the beginning of his administration,\" Cornyn said. \"This is not an improvement. This is a fig leaf and I think the American people are not going to be fooled.\"\n\nJennifer Babaie of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that provides legal services to migrants in west Texas and Mexico, said she was concerned about what the order could portend for vulnerable migrants if it does not create safer, legal options for migrating.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of confusion among people about how to enter. I think we're going to see more people forced into trafficking routes,\" Babaie said. \"It's just danger to women, children and the LGBTQ community that we serve. I mean those are the number one groups of people that we're screening in Ju\u00e1rez, many have been waiting for months [to enter the U.S.].\"\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated.\n\nWe've added new speakers to the stellar lineup of leaders, lawmakers and newsmakers hitting the stage at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 5-7 in downtown Austin.

Republicans have accused the Biden administration of not doing enough to curb migration. Biden supporters, however, have noted that the president has taken action on the southern border, including requesting more funds to be directed toward border security and increasing the use of expedited removal in January 2023.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, there were about 2.48 million encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border, up from 1.73 million in 2021, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday afternoon, Trump slammed Biden's immigration policies after two police officers in Queens, New York, were shot by a migrant over the weekend.\n\n\"Last night, two brave NYPD officers doing their job were shot by a Monster Illegal Immigrant who came here illegally from Venezuela last year and was living in a tax-payer funded migrant shelter. Crooked Joe Biden has trafficked in the worst people from around the world, many with heinous criminal records, and unleashed them into our communities,\" the former president wrote.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Biden's campaign and the New York Police Department for comment via email.\n\nThe officers were shot early Monday morning in Queens while pulling over a 19-year-old man who was reportedly riding a motorbike the wrong way down a one-way street, according to The New York Times. Both officers are expected to survive. The suspected shooter, who was also shot during the encounter, is also expected to survive.\n\nNew York-based news station WPIX reported that the suspected shooter crossed into the U.S. at Eagle Pass, Texas, in July 2023.\n\nBiden's conservative critics have claimed immigration catalyzes violent crime, though studies have found lower crime rates among immigrants than U.S. citizens. A 2020 Department of Justice (DOJ) study titled, \"Comparing Crime Rates Between Undocumented Immigrants, Legal Immigrants, and Native-born US Citizens in Texas\" found that \"undocumented immigrants had substantially lower crime rates than native-born citizens and legal immigrants across a range of felony offenses.\"\n\nAmid criticism of Biden's handling of the border, his supporters have argued external factors, such as political and economic instability in some Central American countries, drive migration more so than U.S. immigration policy.\n\nMeanwhile, April 2024 delivered some good news to Biden's efforts to mitigate illegal immigration, as it was the first month of the fiscal 2024 that saw a lower number of encounters from 2023, according to CBP data.\n\nDespite these efforts, immigration still remains a sticking point for Biden as he seeks to address concerns among more moderate swing voters while also appeasing the Democratic Party's progressive wing, which has also been critical of his border approach.\n\nPolls have also found a majority of Americans disapprove of Biden's border policy.\n\nA survey conducted by The Associated Press/NORC in March among 1,282 adults found that 68 percent of adults aged 18 and over across the U.S. disapprove of Biden's immigration policy, versus just 31 percent who approve. Even among Democratic voters only 56 percent believe the president has handled the issue well.\n\nSimilarly a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January found 45 percent of adult Americans view \"the large number of migrants seeking to enter the U.S. at the border with Mexico\" as a \"crisis,\" with another 32 percent deeming it a \"major problem.\" By contrast, only 17 percent view it as a \"minor problem\" and four percent as \"not a problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name":

An immigration scholar explains why - and it's not for the reasons that some GOP lawmakers claim", "body": "As debate over U.S. immigration policy heats up during the 2024 presidential campaign, separating fact from fiction on the U.S.-Mexico border becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nIn May 2023, shortly after the end of a public health restriction that allowed U.S. officials to immediately expel asylum-seekers, a team of academic and humanitarian aide colleagues and I went to the Mexican city of Matamoros, just across the Rio Grande from the banks of Brownsville, Texas.\n\nAt the time, we didn't encounter the \"invasion at the border\" that conservative lawmakers such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott predicted would happen once the COVID-19 restrictions - officially known as Title 42 - expired.\n\nFrom what we learned, the actual rush of thousands of people across the border occurred in the days before Title 42 was lifted on May 11, 2023. Many migrants told us they saw it as their last chance to cross the U.S. border.\n\nMost people we talked to were waiting in overcrowded, temporary camps in Mexico. They feared that if they tried to cross into the U.S., they would lose their opportunity to seek asylum and would be deported under restrictive polices unveiled during the Biden administration.\n\nThe situation at the border has constantly changed ever since. But the brief period when Title 42 ended is a perfect illustration of the differences between right-wing hysteria and the realities on the ground.\n\nSince the fall of 2019, I have been working at the Mexican border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros - across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas. That year, the Trump administration had started the Migrant Protection Protocols.\n\nKnown as \"Remain in Mexico,\" the restrictive policy ended the possibility of asylum for about 70,000 migrants, mostly from Central America. Instead, they were forced to wait in Mexico with little realistic chance of being able to legally enter and stay in the U.S. Anyone who entered the country illegally was deported immediately and barred from applying for asylum for five years.\n\nThe border became even more restrictive during the COVID-19 pandemic when Title 42 was implemented in March 2020. It limited entry into the U.S. at the border to U.S citizens and residents.\n\nTraditional ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border were closed to asylum-seekers in order to prevent the spread of COVID. For example, those who came to the ports of entry at the international bridges in Reynosa or Matamoros would be turned back at the halfway point and not allowed to touch U.S. soil.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration to the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matamoros,_Tamaulipas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matamoros, Tamaulipas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matamoros, Tamaulipas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remain_in_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remain in Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynosa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reynosa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Reynosa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllen,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McAllen, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McAllen, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/292/29219/2921949.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-05-", "textStart": 817, "textEnd": 823}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 2113, "textEnd": 2123}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

In his first hundred days in office, he issued 94 executive orders. President Trump built 500 miles of wall. President Biden stopped that with his executive order. He stopped deportations. President Trump was doing internal immigration enforcement and going after sanctuary cities. President Biden signed an executive order repealing that. He ended the Remain in Mexico policy.\n\n\"What do we get when President Biden undoes all President Trump's policies that worked so effectively - that brought illegal border crossings down to a 40-year low? Well, we get nearly 10 million people who've tried to enter our country illegally. We've seen a humanitarian crisis, a drug trafficking crisis, sex trafficking, child trafficking, a national security crisis. Last year, 172 people on the FBI terrorist watch list tried to cross into our country. Those are just the ones we caught. Under President Trump's four years that number was 14.\n\n\"This president is not serious. He has opened our southern border, and now, because it's an election year, he is trying to show the American people that he's taking steps. But we're not going to believe it. If he were serious, he would implement the Trump-era policies that so successfully brought the numbers of illegal crossing at our border down. He is not serious.\n\n\"I am proud to stand with my Republican colleagues, to call on the president, to get serious about securing our southern border and protect the American people because he is failing. He is endangering our country. The American people will not be fooled by this political ploy.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Ricketts", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Ricketts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeh_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeh Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remain_in_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remain in Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

That was Trump's approach. We should be showing what the difference is.\"\n\nThe order is expected to let officials deny new asylum claims by migrants if daily border crossings reach 2,500 a day or higher, well below the average rate of 4,300 per day in April, the latest month that data is publicly available. The rules, which mirror a proposal from the bipartisan border deal that collapsed in Congress earlier this year, would include exceptions for unaccompanied children and in certain humanitarian situations. But they would still represent a dramatic crackdown by a Democratic president who once campaigned against Donald Trump's hardline approach to immigration.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Alex Padilla, one of his chamber's leading pro-immigration voices, suggested the order was unlikely to succeed as a deterrent. \"You can build a wall as high as you want. You can make it hard to receive asylum if you want. It's not going to sustainably reduce the number of people wanting to come to the United States for a number of reasons until you identify and address root causes,\" he told Semafor.\n\nThe mass influx of asylum seekers at the border has proven to be one of Biden's stickiest political challenges; polls by Gallup have found it's now the issue Americans are most likely to cite as the most important problem facing the country, while a New York Times survey in March found that 49% of registered voters would back new asylum restrictions, versus 43% who would oppose them.\n\nStill, left-leaning Democrats questioned whether Biden's move to the right on the issue would boost his fortunes.\n\n\"We shouldn't fall into the trap that Republicans have set for us,\" Texas Rep. Greg Casar, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told Semafor. \"It's going to not help the President politically because I don't think Fox News is ever going to give him any credit.\"", "source": {"uri": "semafor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "semafor.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramila_Jayapal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pramila Jayapal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Progressive_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Progressive Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semafor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semafor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Padilla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Padilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Casar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Casar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Hispanic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.semafor.com/c70817105d0906b259f2f3b839ff1c1d43ae8f33-1279x884.png?rect=0,107,1279,671&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621683", "eventUri": "eng-9621683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

After a recent internal poll showing Democrat Ike McCorkle would likely beat you in the general election in this solidly Republican district, you should welcome the help.\n\nLet's examine the specious claims in order. The ad narrator suggests, \"There is an invasion at our southern border. Millions are pouring in causing crime, chaos, and death.\"\n\nThe border has seen an unprecedented number of illegal crossers and individuals turning themselves over to U.S. agents to seek asylum and most Americans are understandably frustrated by the government's response.\n\nUnder current law, asylum seekers who meet the credible fear threshold are allowed to remain in the country pending a hearing and are thus here legally for the time being. While most will not ultimately receive asylee status post-hearing, suggesting the majority are here for work or to build a better life rather than fleeing government persecution, these migrants hardly constitute an \"invasion\" as though they were armed for conquest.\n\nIn fact, immigrants, legal or illegal, are less likely to commit crimes than citizens. I'm sure you didn't intend to exploit the comparatively rare death of a citizen at the hands of a criminal alien to give voters the wrong impression about immigrants. Xenophobia has an ugly, indeed lethal, history and stoking it to win an election is beneath even you.\n\nChaos isn't exactly right either. While taxpayers shoulder the costs to provide some asylees, refugees, and illegal border crossers/visa overstayers medical care, education for their children, housing, and food in the short term, these temporary costs are dwarfed by the taxes paid by these individuals and their contribution to the economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that immigration, legal and illegal, will deliver a $7 billion boost to the nation's gross domestic product over the next decade. Economists report that this latest wave of immigrants has contributed significantly to the post-Covid economic boon.\n\nImmigrants are more willing to work than citizens. The population-to-employment ratio for foreign-born persons is 63.4% compared to natives at 59.6%. Foreigners are eager to do jobs eschewed by American workers -- picking vegetables, milking cows, processing poultry, washing dishes, tarring roofs, and the like. These sweaty, thankless, calloused-hands-type jobs support the growth of all business sectors and increase the number of higher-skilled blue and white-collar jobs available.\n\nYour ad says, \"Democrats continue to lie and ignore this crisis.\" Sadly, turns out Republicans deserve much of the mea culpa here. A bipartisan compromise bill sponsored by Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) would have tightened rules for claiming asylum, provided more funding for border agents and immigration judges, given the administration the authority to close border crossings, ended so-called \"catch and release\" whereby asylum claimants are released until their hearing, and funded scanning technology to intercept narcotics at ports of entry.\n\nLankford, a Baptist minister, and one of the most conservative legislators in the Senate discovered the devil isn't in the details it's in the political calculation. Trump told the Republican Speaker of the House not to take up the bill so the GOP could run on the border issue and the fiction that Democrats were unwilling to come to the table.\n\nInstead of doing anything meaningful, the GOP House intends to vote for legislation to bar noncitizens from voting which is already illegal. Your ad claims you are \"taking action to stop the invasion.\" If posturing counts as action, you guys are nailing it.\n\nThe ad then says, \"We need to shut down the border, build the wall, and deport them all.\" Catchy rhyme but there are several issues with these recommendations. There are around 330 ports of entry into the U.S. including 48 land crossing points from Mexico, as well as, airports and seaports that receive international travelers. Shutting down the entire border with Mexico, our second largest trading partner, would cost the U.S. billions of dollars, cause a diplomatic crisis, and disrupt the lives of the millions of Americans and Mexicans who legally cross every day.\n\nA third of the Mexico-U.S., 1,969 mile border is already fenced. Border walls are effective at deterring crossing at those points and shifting illegal crossing to more remote areas. Walls do not stop individuals from presenting themselves to border agents at ports of entry and claiming asylum. Moreover, walls are ineffective at stopping drug trafficking since drugs are smuggled in by motor vehicles through ports of entry. Some areas cannot be fenced because of ecological impacts. This isn't to say that additional construction would not be useful but at $20 million a mile, the U.S. needs to be judicious. There will never be a 1,969 mile wall along the border.\n\nAlso, deporting 11 million of people as former President Donald Trump claims he will do with the aid of police, the National Guard, and possibly the military has significant feasibility as well as humanitarian concerns. It will require complicated logistics involving transportation, legal hearings, and diplomatic negotiations. Large detention camps will be necessary. Maybe he'll build something in Granada, Colorado.\n\nWith less than two weeks left in the primary, there is time to correct your campaign ad, Congresswoman Boebert. Honesty is always the best policy. I'll put the consulting bill in the mail.\n\nKrista L. Kafer is a weekly Denver Post columnist.

In its statement, Wells Fargo affirmed its commitment to the Philadelphia region, noting it has nearly 4,000 employees in Pennsylvania. Wells Fargo is second in the region for market share, trailing only TD Bank.\n\nComcast Spectacor, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for its long-standing relationship with Wells Fargo and \"look forward to working with a new partner as we continue to bring the best sports and entertainment experience to fans in the Philadelphia region.\"\n\nSince opening in 1996, the South Philadelphia arena has had several different names due to a string of bank acquisitions. The arena opened Aug. 31, 1996, as the CoreStates Center and was rebranded the First Union Center after First Union Corp. acquired CoreStates Bank in 1998. The name was changed again in 2003, two years after First Union and Wachovia merged. It became the Wells Fargo Center in 2010, two years after the San Francisco-banking giant bought Wachovia.\n\nCoreStates Bank negotiated a $40 million, 29-year naming rights deal for the venue in 1996.\n\nComcast-Spectacor, a subsidiary of Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ: CMCSA), also owns the Flyers while the 76ers are a tenant of the arena.\n\nDuring the 2015-16 NBA season, after the team and the bank ended a business relationship, the 76ers ceased recognizing Wells Fargo's naming rights and referred to the arena simply as \"The Center.\" The Wells Fargo logo on the court has been painted white so it is barely visible.\n\nThe 76ers then signed a non-signage sponsorship agreement with Firstrust Bank as their official banking sponsor. They have since moved on to work with Fulton Bank.\n\nFor the past few years, the 76ers have been pitching building their own $1.3 billion arena at 10th and Market streets when their lease at the Wells Fargo Center expires in 2031.\n\nComcast Spectacor has spent $400 million to upgrade the Wells Fargo Center. The company released plans this year to transform the broader South Philadelphia Sports Complex by 2028.\n\nThe proposed $2.5 billion plan encompasses a $12 million renovation to Xfinity Live! and construction of a 5,500-seat concert venue, a 250-key hotel, restaurants and retail shops. The project would turn large swaths of the parking lots surrounding the Wells Fargo Center into a massive shopping and entertainment destination.", "source": {"uri": "bizjournals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_Spectacor", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comcast Spectacor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naming rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Flyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wachovia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wachovia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreStates_Financial_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CoreStates Financial Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto\u2013Dominion_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto\u2013Dominion Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Philadelphia_Sports_Complex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Philadelphia Sports Complex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity_Live!_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity Live!

Those interested in a balance transfer card could consider the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card instead.\n\nIf you're trying to do the right thing for your finances, a good balance transfer card can be a great help in your quest. Whether you are trying to pay down debt or avoid using your own cash for large purchases, a no-to-low APR can get you well on the way to that goal.\n\nWhile the Wells Fargo Platinum card* once offered a lengthy 0 percent introductory APR period, it's no longer available to new applicants. However, there are several benefits you can take advantage of as an existing cardholder.\n\nIn addition to the Platinum card's perks and benefits, it helps to know that the Wells Fargo card is issued by an established bank with deep roots in the financial services industry.\n\nWells Fargo is currently the fourth largest bank in the U.S. and it holds the oldest continuously operating bank charter in the U.S. It's worth mentioning, however, that it has been working to mend its reputation from a string of scandals in the past few years. So far, it has complied with orders to make things right for customers like issuing refunds, changing its internal operations and revamping its line of credit cards to be more competitive.\n\nWhether this will make a huge difference to Wells' customers remains to be seen, but it helps to know that plans are in the works for a comeback with existing and new customers. These small details can sometimes give you the confidence that your card issuer wants to preserve its reputation and, hopefully, do right by you as a valued cardholder in the years to come.\n\nIf you used the Wells Fargo Platinum card's introductory APRs in the past, Wells Fargo may continue to send future balance transfer offers to you as a Platinum cardholder. You may also receive similar offers when you consistently pay your monthly bill. These prequalified offers could be for very low APRs or 0 percent for additional balance transfers, depending on prevailing market conditions, the bank's credit portfolio at the time and your creditworthiness.\n\nYou can also be eligible for a credit limit increase with Wells Fargo as long as you keep low balances and maintain a healthy credit profile, especially regarding your credit utilization and on-time payments. It doesn't hurt to maintain a Wells Fargo Bank account with larger balances, either.\n\nThe process to request a higher limit is relatively easy. It can be done on the phone and can sometimes result in an instant decision for a credit limit increase.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Platinum card offers some of the highest coverage you'll find for cellphone protection -- up to $600 in reimbursement for repair or replacement of your phone, minus a $25 deductible. However, this insurance kicks in only once you've exhausted other applicable options like homeowners' or auto insurance or coverage you purchased through your cellphone carrier or manufacturer.\n\nTo activate cellphone protection, you must pay your phone bill with your Wells Fargo card each month. There are additional terms and limitations to this coverage, so read the fine print to make sure you can take advantage of this card benefit when you need it.\n\nAnother benefit of being a Wells Fargo Platinum cardholder is having access to several credit education tools, including:\n\nThere's also a tool you can use to calculate your debt-to-income ratio, which can sometimes lead you to offers for other Wells Fargo credit cards or personal loans to consolidate your debt.\n\nIt might help to consider the additional perks that typically come with credit cards that include an annual fee:\n\nIf you've had the Wells Fargo Platinum card in your wallet for a while, keeping it can add to your credit history and improve your score when you use it responsibly.

Launched in 2020, grantees report the Open for Business Fund has now benefited more than 336,000 small businesses, empowering them to keep or create more than 461,000 jobs in communities across the nation.\n\n\"We took the gross processing fees the government paid us for administering the Paycheck Protection Program in 2020 and committed all of it to a roughly $420 million fund whose singular purpose was to assist small business owners having a hard time during Covid,\" said Charlie Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo. \"Our funds went toward providing capital and expertise at scale, ultimately creating local jobs, bolstering the ecosystem of support, and creating a ripple effect that continues to strengthen communities across the country.\"\n\n\"At the time, we were stressed about keeping the lights on and retaining employees who are like family to me,\" said Julius \"Eddie\" Lofton of JC Lofton Tailors in Washington, D.C., a family business since the 1930s. \"When I got a $10,000 grant, it lifted a burden off me, and I knew I'd maintain my family's legacy.\" Lofton was an early recipient of a grant through Local Initiatives Support Corporation and has since renovated his shop as business improved.\n\nReaching small business owners who often struggle to access capital and expertise was a priority for the program in order to preserve livelihoods and jobs. The newest data reported by Open for Business Fund grantees indicates 79% of small business owners who benefited are racially or ethnically diverse, 53% are women, and 72% identify as low-to-moderate income individuals.\n\nStrengthening the small business ecosystem\n\nCommunity organizations say the lessons learned from the Open for Business Fund are a roadmap for future investment in the small business community.\n\n\"The Wells Fargo grant acted as a catalyst that allowed the Veteran Loan Fund to successfully attract investors and CDFIs, and thus, deploy $15 million in loan capital while also helping member CDFIs like PeopleFund grow their lending to veterans and provide expertise in areas like marketing, accounting, inventory management, and more across the country,\" said Gustavo Lasala, president and CEO at PeopleFund, a proud member of Veteran Loan Fund.\n\nShifting focus to asset ownership and future growth\n\nThe final phase of the Open for Business Fund is still underway into 2025. In five markets -- Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Los Angeles, and Miami -- small business owners are building generational wealth by acquiring valuable tangible assets such as commercial property, equipment, and technology.\n\n\"The Open for Business Fund support allowed me to buy new equipment that changes the way my team works to better serve customers,\" said Sara Agudelo, employer of 50 people and owner of Purple Orchid, a healthy food and beverage company that worked with The Miami Foundation, a grantee. \"Now we are dreaming of acquiring commercial real estate property for the business, something that I never thought I would be able to do.\"\n\nAbout Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) is a leading financial services company that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company has created the \"6.85% Fixed Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series FF,\" with 80,000 shares authorized, each holding a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share.\n\nThe announcement, made on Monday, comes after the company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Delaware Secretary of State on Friday, July 19, 2024. The filing details the voting powers, preferences, and other special rights of the Series FF Preferred Stock, which are not fixed by the company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\n\nFurthermore, on Tuesday, Wells Fargo completed the sale of 2,000,000 Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/25th interest in a share of the Series FF Preferred Stock. This move is part of the company's efforts to raise capital and was facilitated by an underwriting agreement dated July 16, 2024, between Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, acting as the representative of the several underwriters involved.\n\nThe Depositary Shares were registered under the company's existing Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269514) with the SEC. Accompanying the SEC filing, Wells Fargo also submitted several other documents including the underwriting agreement, the Certificate of Designation, a Deposit Agreement, a form of Depositary Receipt, and legal opinions regarding the validity of the new preferred stock and related agreements.\n\nThis strategic financial decision by Wells Fargo is based on a press release statement and aligns with the company's ongoing management of its capital structure. The new Series FF Preferred Stock is set to enhance the company's financial flexibility, although the filing does not elaborate on the intended use of proceeds from the sale of Depositary Shares.\n\nInvestors and market watchers now have access to the new preferred stock, which is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under a yet-to-be-announced ticker symbol.\n\nIn other recent news, Wall Street banks, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), have reported robust performances in equity trading. Bank of America saw a 20% increase in revenue from equities trading, reaching $1.9 billion, while Morgan Stanley experienced an 18% surge, amounting to $3 billion. Goldman Sachs also reported a 7% rise in equities revenue to $3.17 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, Wells Fargo has been maintaining a neutral stance with a $63 target, as per Citi's analysis, due to a softer net interest income (NII) outlook. The bank's future expectations include a full-year 2024 NII that is 8-9% lower than in 2023. BMO Capital Markets updated its price target for Wells Fargo shares to $59.00, maintaining a Market Perform rating.\n\nIn response to Wells Fargo's second-quarter financial results, which showcased a robust performance in capital markets fees but also presented a less optimistic full-year guidance, BMO Capital Markets' projections for future earnings remain largely unchanged. Despite a decrease in net interest income and average loans, Wells Fargo saw positive growth in average deposits across all customer-facing businesses.\n\nThese are recent developments as Wells Fargo continues its transformation journey. The bank's ability to manage costs and sustain fee income growth will be critical factors in achieving the projected financial metrics and valuation.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preferred stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_structure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital structure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_trader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock trader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_filing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SEC filing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ticker symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMO_Capital_Markets", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMO Capital Markets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPED7G1M3_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759373", "eventUri": "eng-9759373", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 537, "textEnd": 544}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 1023, "textEnd": 1030}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Firstly, the bank highlights what it sees as Tesla's weak fundamentals, which it says were evident in the second quarter.\n\nThe company reported an EPS of $0.52, which missed consensus estimates, and its auto gross margin, excluding electric vehicle credits, fell to 14.6% from 16.4% in the previous quarter.\n\nAlthough Tesla managed to sell nearly double the electric vehicle credits compared to the previous quarter, Wells Fargo says these weak fundamentals overshadowed this achievement.\n\n\"TSLA Q2 had no 'razzle dazzle', leaving investors focused on the weakening fundamentals,\" Wells Fargo analysts noted.\n\nMoreover, they note that Tesla faces significant political and tariff risks. The company's CFO warned of second-half headwinds due to EU tariffs on Chinese imports and recent US EV battery tariffs.\n\nThese tariffs are expected to add approximately $9,000 to the cost of EU Model 3s and $1,000 to US Model 3 Standard Range vehicles. While Tesla benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) buyer credits and production tax credits, Wells Fargo believes a potential Trump administration's negative stance on electric vehicles and the IRA poses a major risk.\n\n\"While TSLA is viewed as benefiting from a Trump win, we see major risks given his negative view on EVs & IRA,\" Wells Fargo analysts explained.\n\nFundamentally, Tesla's challenges persist, according to the bank. The company reiterated its guidance of \"notably lower\" year-over-year delivery growth, with deliveries down approximately 7% in the first half of the year.\n\nThey add that the second half's demand drivers remain unclear, with Tesla continuing financing promotions, implying ongoing price pressure.\n\nFurthermore, they state that despite some positive developments, such as expected lower-cost 4680 cells by the fourth quarter, the overall outlook remains uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, Wells Fargo maintains a cautious outlook on Tesla, reiterating its Underweight rating and price target of $120, reflecting the challenges and risks the company faces in the near term.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEE8G0G4_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759373", "eventUri": "eng-9759373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The arena formerly known as the CoreStates, First Union, and Wachovia Center will now add Wells Fargo to that list because the bank is bowing out next August according to Gillian Tan and Christopher Palmeri at Bloomberg:\n\nThe bank's deal with arena owner, Comcast Corp., expires in August of next year, according to a spokesperson for the Philadelphia-based media and telecom giant.\n\n\"We are grateful for our long-standing relationship with Wells Fargo and look forward to working with a new partner as we continue to bring the best sports and entertainment experience to fans in the Philadelphia region,\" Comcast's Spectacor unit said in a statement.\n\nWells Fargo has been pulling away from such sponsorships, taking its name off of a PGA Tour event last year and a Jacksonville, Florida, office tower this year.\n\nGood. Get the stink of the Wells Fargo Center out of there. Neither team has ever had any success in that place as long as a bank has owned the naming rights. They've had more Arena Bowl Championships won in there then NHL and NBA combined.\n\nWells Fargo did have one of the sweetest naming rights deals ever. They only spent $1.4 million annually to be the rights holder of The Center. Compare that to Lincoln Financial who pays $12 million annually through 2032 and Citizens Bank which pays $3.8 million annually, but whose deal is up in a couple years, and that's chump change. Compare it to Crypto.com arena out in Los Angeles who is paying $35 million a year and you can guess the price of the brick is going up:\n\nMy first guess is that this will somehow add another wrinkle to the Sixers and Flyers arena drama. My second guess is that it will be called the Xfinity Center when it's all said and done.

But if the Sixers can somehow give one more fuck you to the Flyers on their way out the door I'm all for it. I love when billionaires squabble! Would the Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Center be in play? What about the David Adelman Dome? 76 Place II? It's all on the table.\n\nHopefully we get a local company in the mix. The early favorite in the clubhouse on social media is obviously Wawa:\n\nDo they have the scratch? Who knows how much is tied up in their quest to expand westward? Would the Morgan & Morgan Megaplex be a potential name? The only good that would come out of that is getting to call it \"The Jawn\". And as a business strategy it makes sense. Anytime someone slips and falls they can sue the building and Jawn Morgan can have one of his people represent them. It's a win-win. The IBX Center could be a sneaky play with Dan Hilferty's ties to the insurance giant. If we stay in the financial realm you gotta think Vanguard, SIG, or WSFS are heavy favorites.\n\nIf they really want to pay homage to Philadelphia they'll go with this:", "source": {"uri": "crossingbroad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crossing Broad"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_pagan@crossingbroad.com", "name": "Kyle Pagan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_Spectacor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comcast Spectacor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naming rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Blitzer_Sports_&_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity_Center_(College_Park,_Maryland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity Center (College Park, Maryland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Morgan County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Arenas", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Arenas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.crossingbroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WFC_EXTERIOR_WEST_DUSK_FLYERS-scaled-1-1200x628.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759373", "eventUri": "eng-9759373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

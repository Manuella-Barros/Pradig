Another Jamaican, 37-year-old Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, is in the mix in her fifth and final Olympics; Fraser-Pryce won the 100 in 2008 and 2012.\n\nEarlier this week, Jackson's coach, Stephen Francis, told the Jamaica Gleaner website this week that Jackson \"appears OK to me.\"\n\nJackson, however, described the decision to pull out as coming from both herself and Francis.\n\n\"It was a combination of so much stuff that I personally don't want to talk about,\" she said. \"Sometimes you have to go through a rocky road to get where you're trying to go. And my rocky road has happened to me.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old took bronze in the 100 at Tokyo and won a silver medal behind Fraser-Pryce at world championships in 2022. She has won the last two world titles at 200 meters.\n\nLast year's win came in a time of 21.41 seconds. It was only .07 off Flo-Jo's 36-year-old world record and after that win, the discussion turned to when, not if, Jackson or a rival -- possibly American Gabby Thomas -- would break that hallowed mark.\n\nWhile Thomas has the three best times of 2024, headed by a 21.78, Jackson's best time this year is 22.29, with which she won Jamaica's national title in June. She insists she is ready for the 200, which starts with qualifying Sunday.\n\n\"I always felt good. I felt good about both the 100 and the 200,\" she said. \"I'm definitely healthy, and I'm definitely OK.\"\n\nAt the last Olympics, Jackson misjudged the field in an opening-round race of the 200, decelerated too quickly and ended up finishing fourth and not advancing for a shot at the title.\n\nShe had called it a devastating moment, though on Wednesday she said that despite what happened, being at the Olympics was still a great experience. She went on to team with Fraser-Pryce, Thompson-Herah and Briana Williams to add gold in the 4x100 relay to her 100-meter bronze.", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eddie_pells@beaumontenterprise.com", "name": "Eddie Pells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/14/61/25480285/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778844", "eventUri": "eng-9778844", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson, expected to be one of the top contenders in the 100-meter race, has dropped out and will focus on the 200.\n\n\"Yes I'm only running the 200-meter here,\" she said Wednesday morning at an event at Puma House in Paris. \"Just period.\"\n\nJackson added that in Paris, her third Olympics, she's looking to just focus on running her fastest times. After experiencing all the international frills in 2016 and the COVID-19 quirks in 2021, she's now used to the Olympic stage.\n\nNews of Jackson dropping the 100 was first shared by Jamaican team manager Ludlow Watts with Reuters. Watts declined to provide a reason. But on July 9 in Hungary, in her final race before the Olympics, Jackson pulled up with a calf cramp.\n\nJackson's withdrawal comes two months after injury forced two-time reigning Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah out of the Olympic games.\n\nRichardson, who hasn't lost this year in the 100, is making her Olympic debut this week in Paris and is in arguably the best form of her career.\n\nJackson was one of Richardson's greatest competitors in the vaunted dash. Jackson -- who won a gold medal on Jamaica's 4\u00d7100 team at the Tokyo Olympics and a bronze medal in the 100 -- won the Jamaican trials in June with a time of 10.84 in the 100-meter final. She will be replaced by Shashalee Forbes, whose season best is 11.03 seconds.\n\nJackson and Richardson split their last two head-to-head meetings. Richardson beat the field in the 2023 World Championships in Budapest. Her stunning come-from-behind victory in 10.65 seconds is featured in the Netflix documentary \"Sprint.\" Jackson finished second at 10.72.\n\nBut Jackson got revenge a month later at the 2023 Prefontaine Classic, running a wind-aided 10.70 to beat Richardson, who finished fourth in 10.80.\n\nRichardson will still have to deal with legendary Jamaica sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price, who is in her fifth and perhaps final Olympics and is certainly looking to cap her stellar career with a gold medal.\n\nJackson's complete focus on the 200 meters, where she has been aiming to break Florence Griffith-Joyner's decades-old world record, is now the problem of Gabby Thomas, America's favorite in the 200.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

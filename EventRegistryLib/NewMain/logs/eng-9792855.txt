As the favorite in Tokyo, Lyles was beaten by both Bednarek and gold medalist Andre De Grasse (who didn't make this year's final). It was only the second time Lyles had lost a 200-meter final since turning professional after the US Olympic trials in 2016.\n\nIn Wednesday's semifinals, Lyles came in second behind Tebogo in an uncharacteristic performance. LetsRun.com revealed at the time that Lyles \"would not stop in the mixed zone as he was being taken to medical.\"\n\nFollowing the final, Lyles, who is asthmatic, was lying on the track struggling to catch his breath and required medical attention before being taken off in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the NBC broadcast, reporter Lewis Johnson told viewers that Lyles was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday, which was a day off for Lyles in between 200-meter heats and semis. With restrictions no longer in place regarding a positive Covid test, Lyles opted to run anyway.\n\nThis is the second time Lyles has contracted the virus. Lyles had Covid just prior to the 2023 US World Championship trials in Eugene.\n\n\"I've been sick since [the] New York [Grand Prix], I actually got COVID,\" Lyles told reporters afterward. \"I didn't get cleared until Sunday and flew out Monday, so it's been a wild week, a very wild week.\"\n\nLyles finished third to make his first USA 100-meter team on his way to pulling off the 100/200/4x100 triple gold in the World Championships in Budapest.\n\nIn an interview with Lewis Johnson, Lyles explained what happened and how he felt after the diagnosis.\n\n\"I woke up early on Tuesday morning and just feeling really horrible,\" Lyles said. \"I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. Woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately it came up that I was positive for Covid.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic. I've been in worse situations and I've run with worse conditions I felt. We just took it day by day, trying to hydrate as much and quarantine off. It's taking it's toll for sure but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal, whereas last Olympics I was very disappointed. This time I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nLyles said that he never considered withdrawing from the final, but in terms of running the anchor leg of Friday's 4x100 relay, it's a different story.\n\n\"At the moment I don't know,\" Lyles said. \"I'm feeling more on the side of letting team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me. If that's the case coming off today, I'm perfectly fine saying 'Hey, you guys go do your thing. You've got more than enough speed to get the gold medal.\"\n\nIt's a monumental victory for Tebogo, who's been competing with a heavy heart since the unexpected passing of his mother back in May. The 21-year-old has been one of the best sprinting prospects in recent memory. He holds the U20 world record in the 100 meters at 9.91 seconds and won the silver in the 100 and bronze in the 200 at last year's Worlds.\n\nWith this win, Tebogo is the first gold medalist for Botswana in Olympic history, as well as the first African Olympic champion in the 200 meters. There is no doubt that he will be a chief rival of Lyles for years to come in both sprints, and he's pulled off one of the greatest 200-meter performances in history.", "source": {"uri":

Lyles, who has been claiming to be the fastest man in the world, collected bronze in the final, and some are questioning if it has do to with COVID-19.\n\nLyles is fresh off a gold medal win for his 100-meter performance on Aug. 4. Just four days later, Lyles placed third after unexpectedly losing to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo. But what was even more shocking than Lyles' loss was when the athlete was carted off by medical staff in a wheelchair following the race.\n\nSources confirmed to AP News that Lyles tested positive for COVID two days before the Thursday final. The virus, known to affect the respiratory system, was especially scary for Lyles, who has a history of asthma.\n\nImmediately following news of Lyles' diagnosis, X users began debating if COVID caused the athlete's underperformance.\n\nX user @marL0wE called Lyles a \"Buffalo soldier\" for continuing the race despite his condition.\n\nAnother user expressed their sympathies for Lyles as he continues to recover.\n\nComing into the Paris Olympics, Lyles held the top 200-meter time in the world this year at 19.53 seconds. At the semifinals, he ran a 20.08, and during the finals, Lyles stopped at 19.70 seconds. Even with COVID, Lyles managed to earn a medal, and X user @_Zeets said that makes Lyles' performance especially impressive.\n\nUsed to making history, Lyles became the first American to win gold in 100-meters finals since 2004. The 27-year-old was set on becoming the first American to win the sprint double since Carl Lewis in 1984, but for the second time in Lyles' career, COVID prevailed.\n\nLyles went to Tokyo for the summer Olympics in 2020, during the height of the global pandemic. Although he won a bronze medal during the games, Lyles spoke about how the empty stands affected his mental health:\n\n\"I just remember being so [like] 'this is not it,\" Lyles said recalling his mindset before the 200-meter race. \"'This is not what I wanted. This is not what I thought it was gonna be like,'\" he continued.\n\nDespite his COVID diagnosis this time around, Lyles was determined to still hit the track. \"I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn't have any time to save energy, so that was kind of the strategy for today,\" he told reporters after the race. \"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100% but I would definitely say I'm closer to like, 90 to 95%.\"", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/ebcb19e2ac55b5b34cbff4b738e06d65.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 355, "textEnd": 361}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and ended up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter racing on the world's biggest sports stage revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70 -- .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nIt was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nLyles seemed like a sure thing, until things got weird the night before\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nLyles said he tested positive two days after the 100 final\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after the race, Lyles collapsed to the ground, rolled on his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nThis bronze medal feels different than the last one\n\nIt will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\n\nThere's still a chance Lyles could end up as the bigger-than-track superstar he set out to become after his disappointment in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThose Games, delayed by a year and staged in front of no fans while the COVID pandemic raged, took a mental-health toll on Lyles, one he said made him less than himself and led to his disappointing finish in Tokyo.\n\nAfter he won the 100 Sunday night, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nThere's a chance for one more gold medal in the relay\n\nLyles could still walk out of Paris with two gold medals.\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles would have normally been expected to run the anchor leg.\n\nHe said he was feeling around 90 to 95%, and that he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision on whether he should be in the lineup for a race the Americans haven't captured a medal in since 2004.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said.\n\nEither way, Thursday's race threw a damper on, at least temporarily, the carefree Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans, the return of the celebration, the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-COVID\" Games.\n\nA javelin gold for Pakistan, and silver for India\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45 meters, a season best.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He also said he was administered whatever medications he could legally take without causing problems during postrace drug testing. Paxlovid was among the medications he took, a USA Track and Field spokesperson confirmed.\n\n\"I still wanted to run, they said it was still possible,\" Lyles said. \"So we just stayed away from everybody and just tried to take it round by round. And to be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn't have any time to save energy.\"\n\nHe added that he tried to keep his diagnosis as \"close to the chest as possible\" for several reasons.\n\n\"One, we didn't want everybody to go into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete,\" Lyles said. \"And then two, we wanted to be able to make it as discreet as possible. And, you never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nLyles isn't sure if he will still participate in the 4x100-meter relay at 1:45 ET on Friday, but he said the Americans have the speed to run the race without him.\n\n\"I'll talk to the coaches,\" Lyles said. \"I'm going to be very honest and transparent with them, and I'm going to let them make the decision. I believe that no matter what happens, I believe that this 4x1 team, they can handle anything and everything. I've been with them in practice, and they are more than capable to come out with a win and even break as many records as they take their mind to.\"\n\nOne day after losing the 200-meter semifinal to Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Lyles was unable to surpass him once again in the final Thursday night.\n\nTebogo ran an African-record 19.46 to earn the 200-meter gold medal. Finishing just behind him with silver was American Kenny Bednarek, who posted a 19.62-second showing. Bednarek was pleased to have received a second silver after he earned one in the 200 at the Tokyo Games, but he believed he had more he could have shown Thursday.\n\n\"I knew the race was gonna be tight and sometimes you see people in your peripheral visions and you want to do a little extra,\" Bednarek said. \"I felt like I didn't do anything extra, but I know for a fact that this wasn't my best performance.\"\n\nWhen he spoke with reporters, Tebogo said he didn't know Lyles had COVID. Bednarek said he had no concerns about getting it from his teammate himself.\n\n\"I don't care. I mean, If I get sick or whatever, I'll be fine,\" Bednarek said. \"I don't view those things as a big deal. I'm healthy, I do everything I can to make sure my body's healthy. So it doesn't really bother me at all.\"\n\nTebogo said he noticed Lyles wearing a mask during warmups the last two days but didn't understand why. He felt like Lyles must have been going through something. In terms of feeling like Lyles put him at risk for being sick, Tebogo added: \"I don't know he put anyone at risk ... We are Africans. We are strong.\n\n\"Hopefully he will recover, then I hope the team win the gold medal in the 4x100-meter.\"\n\nAs soon as he crossed the finish line third, Lyles laid down on his back on the track. Within moments, he was surrounded by athletic trainers and members of the Paris Olympics medical staff, who moved him toward a wall as they administered treatment.\n\nAt one point, Lyles was seen wearing a mask before being placed in a chair which was eventually wheeled into the nearby tunnel.\n\n\"I was quite lightheaded after that race and the shortness of breath and chest pain was definitely active,\" said Lyles, who has been quite public about his longtime experiences with asthma. \"But after a while underneath, I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm doing a lot better now.\n\n\"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100 percent, but I definitely would say I'm closer to like 90-90%.\"\n\nAfter Wednesday's semifinal heat, Lyles did not come through the media mixed zone. He instead was taken directly to medical for what was an undisclosed reason.\n\nDuring Thursday's race, all eight runners got off to a somewhat even start. Lyles was in the hunt early. Around the 100-meter mark, Tebogo and Bednarek began pulling away. Although Lyles was still hanging close with them, Tebogo's lead was one he was not relinquishing easily.\n\nMinutes after the race, Lyles was also handed a yellow card for a violation of Technical Rule 7.1 for \"improper conduct.\" It wasn't immediately clear why he was given it, but during introductions, he did demonstrably jump onto the track as he heard his name.\n\nWhile pumping up the crowd before the race, Lyles smacked the box housing the speaker in his lane so hard that the number on the box fell off.\n\nLyles' 200-meter showing followed his 9.79-second, personal-best effort in Sunday's close 100-meter dash. He earned the gold medal in what was the closest 100-meter final since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or perhaps ever. Back then, Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in 10.25 seconds in an era when timing didn't go down to the thousandths of a second.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType":

The American fell behind early and struggled to make up ground rounding the turn, leaving himself too far behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana to overtake him before they reached the finish line.\n\nTebogo won in 19.46 seconds. American Kenny Bednarek claimed silver in 19.62 seconds Lyles settled for bronze in 19.70 seconds, well shy of his personal best (19.31) and even further away from the Usain Bolt world record that he had aspirations of breaking.\n\nAfter the race ended, Lyles sat on the track and appeared to receive medical attention.\n\nLyles had hoped to become the first American man to complete the Olympic sprint double since Carl Lewis 40 years ago. He seemed to be well on his way after , dipping at the finish line to edge Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by five thousandths of a second.\n\nThat Lyles didn't add the 200 gold to his haul is a massive surprise. This race is Lyles' specialty, his first love, the event that comes most naturally to him.\n\nThe 100 penalizes Lyles for struggling to accelerate out of the blocks as quickly as other world-class sprinters. He has spent years tinkering endlessly with his start in an effort to find a way to remain in striking distance at 30 meters without sacrificing his ability to reach maximum speed and sustain it.\n\nThe 200 reduces the impact of Lyles' mediocre starts and emphasizes the qualities that make him special. The two-time reigning world champion in the 200 holds his speed as well as any sprinter since Usain Bolt, typically enabling him to swallow up anyone in front of him as he rounds the curve and streaks toward the finish line.\n\nWhen asked earlier this week how confident he felt about winning the men's 200, Lyles grinned and said, \"Pretty confident, can't lie.\"\n\nSpeaking specifically about fellow American Kenny Bednarek, Lyles added, \"That man ain't winning. None of them is winning.\"\n\nIn retrospect, perhaps there should have been more concern on Wednesday when Lyles took a rare loss in the 200 semifinals. He sprang out of the blocks slowly, languished in third place as he came off the curve and never caught up to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nIn the 100, Lyles also lost his semifinal but came through when it mattered. In the 200, his favorite race, Lyles couldn't repeat that feat.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H_j3ssoRXJDu1AuZpYkwOw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-08/d7654560-55b3-11ef-9ba7-16e309c90b35", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and ended up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter racing on the world's biggest sports stage revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70 -- .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Aug. 6 and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after the race, Lyles collapsed to the ground, rolled on his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nIt will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\n\nThere's still a chance Lyles could end up as the bigger-than-track superstar he set out to become after his disappointment in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThose Games, delayed by a year and staged in front of no fans while the COVID pandemic raged, took a mental-health toll on Lyles, one he said made him less than himself and led to his disappointing finish in Tokyo.\n\nAfter he won the 100 Aug. 4, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nLyles could still walk out of Paris with two gold medals.\n\nThe men's 4\u00d7100 relay is set for Aug. 9, and Lyles would have normally been expected to run the anchor leg.\n\nHe said he was feeling around 90 to 95%, and that he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision on whether he should be in the lineup for a race the Americans haven't captured a medal in since 2004.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said.\n\nEither way, the Aug. 8 race threw a damper on, at least temporarily, the carefree Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans, the return of the celebration, the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-COVID\" Games.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

A person familiar with Lyles' condition, who did not want to be identified, told AP was diagnosed with COVID two days before the final.\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nTebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nLyles came into Paris having not been beaten in a 200 since that night in Tokyo, and after his win in the 100, he brought the bronze medal to the press conference, slammed it on the table and said that had been his motivation for three full years.\n\nNow, he'll get another one.\n\nThursday's final marked the second straight night Tebogo beat him to the finish line in the Lyles' favorite race. Lyles' win streak ended when he finished second in the semifinal. After that one, skipped his traditional meeting with reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nThis time, Tebogo was leading as the sprinters reached the curve. Usually at that point, Lyles puts on his trademark close, but there was no strong finish -- only a desperate push in to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/8/8/noah-lyles-1-2159949-1723144446531.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt appears to be a wrap for Noah Lyles at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe American sprinter Lyles, who won gold in the men's 100m race on Sunday, suffered an upset in Thursday's 200m race. Letsile Tebogo of Botswana took home the gold, and Kenny Bednarek of the United States secured the silver, while Lyles settled for the bronze. You can see the video of the race here.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles, who went down to the ground after crossing the finish line and had to be taken off in a wheelchair, revealed he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier in the week. Apparently, Lyles had competed in the 200m race while battling COVID.\n\nThe news led to questions about whether or not Lyles would still be able to compete in the men's 4\u00d7100 relay, which is scheduled for Friday. In a post to his Instagram page several hours later, Lyles indicated that he would not be doing so.\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" Lyles wrote in his post as he offered congratulations and thanks for his Olympic run.\n\nThe 4\u00d7100 team for the U.S. still has plenty of firepower to get the job done. Bednarek, Fred Kerley (who won bronze in the 100m), Kyree King, Christian Coleman, and Courtney Lindsay are the other members of that team.\n\nAs for Lyles, he may have had a disappointing finish to the Olympics (on top of getting clowned for his bronze finish in the 200m after talking smack in the lead-up to the race). But Lyles will still return home as an Olympic gold medalist and should be proud of himself for powering through his illness to earn another individual medal on top of that.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyree_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyree King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noah-lyles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He tested positive for COVID-19, Lyles said, around 5 a.m. on Tuesday. Lyles quarantined in a hotel near the Olympic Village, he said, and started taking Paxlovid to treat the symptoms. \"I still wanted to run,\" said Lyles. \"We just stayed away from everybody, and just try to take it round by round.

Each federation can sort of make its own rules, and it seems that teams have handled decisions on a case-by-case basis. Since Lyles participates in an outdoor event, rates of transmission and risk of infection to others are relatively low. The silver medalist, Team USA's Kenny Bednarek, said he had no issue with Lyles hugging him after the race.\n\nThe 200-m winner, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, also did not object to Lyles lining up for the race. \"I wouldn't say we were at risk, because it's not a contact sport,\" said Tebogo. He thought something might be askew with Lyles when he saw him keeping to himself in the warm-up area before the race. \"I thought maybe it's just one of those days when he's not having a great day,\" said Tebogo. \"I didn't think of COVID or anything else.\"\n\nRead More: The Inside Story of How Noah Lyles Pulled Off That 100-M Win\n\nLyles kept the news of his diagnosis in a tight circle; his family, medical staff, and coach knew, he said after the race. \"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic,\" he said. \"We wanted to be able to make it as discreet as possible.

Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nIn a statement, the sport's governing body USA Track and Field (USATF) said that it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) stood by Lyles' decision to compete. \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete,\" USATF said in a statement. \"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely. As an organization, we are rigorously adhering to CDC, USOPC, and IOC guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nLyles believes COVID-19 impacted his performance. He was coughing all through the night. \"To be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything,\" he said. \"Coming out to get the bronze medal with COVID [for] three days.\"\n\nLyles wasn't sure if he'd run the 4x100 relay tomorrow night. \"I'm going to be very honest and transparent with them, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" he said. \"I believe that no matter what happens, this four-by-one team can handle anything and everything. I've been with them in practice, they are more than capable to come out with a win.\"\n\nIn Tokyo, Lyles believed the COVID-19 isolation rules, and lack of fans in the stands due to the pandemic, kept him from winning gold. (He was also favored in that race. He also won bronze.) This time around, he contracted COVID-19. Lyles enjoyed his glory moment on Sunday night, with his photo-finish win in the 100.\n\nAt the same time, the Games have been cruel to Lyles. -- with reporting by Alice Park/Saint-Denis, France",

Lyles was also spotted wearing a mask before the race:\n\nFans on X/Twitter weren't so sympathetic, however. They decided to poke fun at Lyles while questioning his decision to run despite dealing with COVID-19:\n\nLyles also captured a bronze medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

However, Lyles made headlines on Thursday when he surprisingly finished in third place after it was revealed he was racing even though he diagnosed with COVID, losing to Botswana sprinter Letsile Tebogo.\n\nAfter the race, Tebogo, who ran a personal best 19.46 during Thursday's final, was asked about potentially becoming one of the faces of track and field after his gold medal performance.\n\n\"I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or loud person like Noah [Lyles],\" Tebogo said. \"So I believe Noah [Lyles] is the face of athletics.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear whether or not Tebogo is directly calling out Lyles, or simply noting that Lyles is known for being outspoken and confident, this is still a shocking thing to say about one of, if not the best runners in the world.\n\nLyles made headlines last year when he called out NBA players for referring to winning the NBA Finals as being \"World Champions\" during his now-infamous press conference where he said \"World Champions of what? The United States?\n\nMore recently, after Lyles won gold in the 100-meter, he was already boasting about how he believed he would win gold again in the 200m.\n\n\"None of them is winning,\" Lyles said. \"When I come off the turn, they will all be depressed.\"\n\nWhile his latest comments were made before he was diagnosed with COVID and his health took a turn for the worse, it looks like Lyles has certainly developed a reputation amongst his peers.

Tebogo currently has a world record in the 300-meter (not currently an Olympic or World Championship event), won gold in the 4 x 400m relays at the 2024 World Relays and won silver in the 100m and bronze in the 200m at the 2023 World Championships.

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and ended up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter racing on the world's biggest sports stage revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70 -- .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after the race, Lyles collapsed to the ground, rolled on his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nIt will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\n\nThere's still a chance Lyles could end up as the bigger-than-track superstar he set out to become after his disappointment in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThose Games, delayed by a year and staged in front of no fans while the COVID pandemic raged, took a mental-health toll on Lyles, one he said made him less than himself and led to his disappointing finish in Tokyo.\n\nAfter he won the 100 Sunday night, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nLyles could still walk out of Paris with two gold medals.\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles would have normally been expected to run the anchor leg.\n\nHe said he was feeling around 90 to 95%, and that he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision on whether he should be in the lineup for a race the Americans haven't captured a medal in since 2004.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said.\n\nEither way, Thursday's race threw a damper on, at least temporarily, the carefree Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans, the return of the celebration, the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-COVID\" Games.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45 meters, a season best.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)",

USA Track and Field reportedly confirmed the diagnosis after the race.\n\nLyles finished third, running behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek, in 19.70 seconds.\n\nMore news: Noah Lyles Wins Bronze in Men's 200M Final\n\nIn a live interview with NBC Sports after the race, Lyles said he first tested positive Tuesday morning, after he claimed the gold medal in the men's 100-meter final.\n\n\"I knew it was more than just being sore from the 100,\" Lyles said. \"My first thought was not to panic. We tried to take it day by day.\"\n\nWearing a black face mask while standing trackside, Lyles told NBC he attempted to stay hydrated and quarantine \"as much as possible\" following his diagnosis.\n\nClearly, the 200-meter race took its toll. Immediately afterward, Lyles was seen leaving the floor of Stade de France in a wheelchair.\n\nJumping and waving his arms prior to Thursday's race, Lyles entered Stade de France with the crowd on his side, well aware of the history at stake. His .005-second victory over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in the 100-meter final set up the potential for a rare double-gold in sprinting's two most prestigious events.\n\nThe post-race image of Lyles sprawled on the track's surface, exasperated, before leaving in a wheelchair stood in stark contrast to the energetic athlete seen immediately before the race.\n\nQuickly, the context was added: Both the BBC and NBC broadcasts revealed during their live post-race discussion that Lyles had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nStill undecided: whether or not Lyles will compete for the United States in the men's 4-by-100 relay event. Lyles confirmed to NBC that he will wait to make that determination.\n\nCompeting without Lyles in in its qualifying heat Thursday, the U.S. quartet of Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley, Kyree King and Courtney Lindsey won with a time of 37.47 seconds.\n\nRound 1 of the men's 4-by-100 is Friday.

Mandatory Credit: Yukihito Taguchi-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBoth Noah Lyles and his haters got their respective moments during the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe American sprinting star Lyles was upset in Thursday's men's 200-meter race, finishing with a bronze medal. Letsile Tebogo of Botswana took home the gold with a time of 19.46 seconds, earning the first-ever Olympic gold medal in his country's history as well as the first Olympic gold in the men's 200m for an African runner. Lyles' fellow American Kenny Bednarek got the silver with a time of 19.62 seconds, and Lyles had to settle for rounding out the podium with his time of 19.70 seconds.\n\nA bronze medal is obviously still a nice achievement for Lyles. But it was ultimately some egg on the face of Lyles since he was heavily favored to win the race and also confidently declared days before the 200m race that he was going to do so.\n\nAs a result, Lyles ended up getting the meme treatment on social media. Here were some of the posts roasting him for the upset loss.\n\nLyles is known for his showmanship, trash talk, and supreme confidence in himself, which can often rub people the wrong way. Many pro athletes in different sports have also expressed their dislike of him.\n\nOf course, the jokes about Lyles' performance on Thursday can only go so far. No matter what, Lyles can say that he is an Olympic gold medalist (after winning the men's 100m race last Sunday). On top of that, it appears there was at least one massive reason for Lyles' disappointing result in the 200m.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/noah-lyles-team-usa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Later, wearing a mask as he spoke with reporters, Lyles said he had COVID.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed in pain, staying down for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" he said.\n\nAn hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThe hurdler expected to challenge her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThis is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games.\n\nHe also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4\u00d7100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said that decision had not been made as of late Thursday.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the home stretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race.

Lyles' American teammate Kenny Bednarek won his second consecutive silver medal, while Lyles took home his second career bronze medal in the event.\n\nThe disappointment soon gave way to a terrifying scene when Lyles was carted off the track by medics after his third place.\n\nAfter winning the 100-meter final in a historic photo finish earlier in the week, Lyles was plagued by a slow start on Thursday. Ultimately, he was unable to catch Bednarek, who led from start to finish and won in 19.46 seconds. Bednarek finished in 19.62 and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70\n\nLyles now has two bronze medals in the 200 meters, including his third-place finish at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nTeam United States bronze medalist Noah Lyles competes in the men's 200 meters final\n\nTeam Botswana's Letsile Tebogo celebrates winning the gold medal in the 200m final\n\nWinning gold in the 100 and 200 meters at a single Olympics is a rare feat. Usain Bolt achieved the double at three consecutive Olympics -- Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. But until the Jamaican, no man had done it since Carl Lewis in Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nAt his last Games, eight years ago, Bolt was finishing in his 200 semifinal when he suddenly realized that Andr\u00e9 De Grasse was running fast. So Bolt turned up the speed and pointed his finger at the Canadian. Fast-forward to the final: Bolt won easily.\n\nLyles previously won the 100m final in a historic photo finish.\n\nThe American showman defeated Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five thousandths of a second, or 0.005 seconds, in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final score in this race: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that one of his physiotherapists had assured him before he left for Paris that this race would be a narrow victory.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close the first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said, pinching his thumb and index finger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nTo put it into perspective, the blink of an eye lasts an average of 0.1 seconds, which was 20 times longer than the gap between the first and second.\n\nIt was a close call, when the sprinters crossed the finish line and the word \"Photo\" appeared next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said, \"I think you have the Olympic dog.\"\n\nThompson, who was three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no idea where he was on the track, was not convinced.\n\n\"I thought, 'Wow, I'm not even sure because it was close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nOnly time would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he ripped his name tag from the front of his bib and held it up. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera, \"America, I told you I could do this!\"\n\nThe top four racers were separated by less than 0.03. The top seven all finished within 0.09 of each other.\n\nAmerican Fred Kerley came in third with a time of 9.81. \"That's probably one of the nicest races I've ever done,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the finish line before anyone else, or anything. But it's the chest that breaks the barrier that counts. Lyles' chest crossed first.\n\nThis was the narrowest 1-2 finish in the 100 meters since Moscow in 1980 -- or perhaps ever.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Red-hot-favorite-Noah-Lyles-finishes-THIRD-in-Olympics-200m-final.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Finishing just behind him with silver was American Kenny Bednarek, who posted a 19.62-second showing.\n\nRounding out the podium placers with bronze was the American sprinter Lyles, who finished in 19.70 seconds. It's the second straight Olympics in which he earned a bronze medal in the race that he has long billed as his premier event.\n\nAs soon as he crossed the finish line third, Lyles laid down on his back on the track. He placed his hands on his head with a look of disbelief on his face. Within moments, he was surrounded by athletic trainers and members of the Paris Olympics medical staff, who moved him toward a wall as they administered some level of treatment.\n\nAt one point, Lyles was seen wearing a mask before being placed in a chair which was eventually wheeled into the nearby tunnel.\n\nIt was immediately unclear what Lyles' medical status was following the race, although NBC's broadcast indicated it had spoken with his mother, who said he had been diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday.\n\nJust after Wednesday's semifinal heat in which Lyles finished second to Tebogo, Lyles did not come through the media mixed zone. He instead was taken directly to medical for what was an undisclosed reason.\n\nDuring Thursday's race, all eight runners got off to a somewhat even start. Lyles was in the hunt early. Around the 100-meter mark, Tebogo and Bednarek began pulling away. Although Lyles was still hanging close with them, Tebogo's lead was one he was not relinquishing easily.\n\nMinutes after the race, Lyles was also handed a yellow card for a violation of Technical Rule 7.1 for \"improper conduct.\" It wasn't immediately clear why he was given it, but during introductions, he did demonstrably jump onto the track as he heard his name.\n\nWhile pumping up the crowd before the race, Lyles smacked the box housing the speaker in his lane so hard that the number on it box fell off.\n\nLyles' 200-meter showing followed his 9.79-second, personal-best effort in Sunday's close 100-meter dash. He earned the gold medal in what was the closest 100-meter final since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or perhaps ever.

He said he never considered not running in the race.\n\n\"Yeah, I woke up early about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning and I just was feeling really horrible,\" Lyles said. \"I knew it was more than just being sore from the 100. You know, woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for COVID. My first thought was not to panic...And we just took it day by day, trying to hydrate as much, quarantined off. And I'd definitely say it's taken it's toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself.\"\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and a year delay before the Games led to depression that he said hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2165371077.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled further way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and ended up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of covid, the virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter racing on the world's biggest sports stage revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking -- but now not-inexplicable -- bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70 seconds, .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nWarning signs\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent, a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after the race, Lyles collapsed to the ground, rolled on his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with covid.\"\n\nLyles still could walk out of Paris with two gold medals.\n\nThe men's 400 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles normally would have been expected to run the anchor leg.\n\nHe said he was feeling around 90 to 95%, and that he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision on whether he should be in the lineup for a race the Americans haven't captured a medal in since 2004.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said.\n\nEither way, Thursday's race threw a damper on, at least temporarily, the carefree Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans, the return of the celebration, the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-covid\" Games.\n\nA javelin gold for Pakistan, and silver for India\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45 meters, a season best.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Lyles, the American sprinter who has endeared himself to fans thanks to his big personality, did the first half of that last week when he narrowly crossed the finish line ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson.\n\nConsidered the weaker of his two events, Lyles winning a gold in the 100 meant that winning the Olympic double was truly on. However, on Thursday evening at Stade de France, Lyles finished third in the 200 for the second straight Olympics, finishing behind teammate Kenny Bednarek and gold medal winner Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in a stunning result.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles was clearly gassed and nearly fell to the track while calling for water. He was tended to by the medical staff and eventually taken off the track in a wheelchair to get further medical attention underneath. Lyles, who deals with asthma, had been wearing a mask prior to his 200m heats, and NBC's Lewis Johnson spoke with his mother after the race and learned that Lyles had tested positive for COVID two days ago after his 100m win.\n\nLyles opted to continue running for the double, and it does explain why he didn't look like he had his normal finishing kick -- and that he could run a 19.7 while sick is quite impressive.

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and collapsed onto the track after ending up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter, racing on the world's biggest sports stage, revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago at the delayed Tokyo Games. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70. That was .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nComing into Paris, Lyles, the three-time world champion with the American record and the world's best time of 2024 on his resume, had seemed like as sure a thing in the 200 as any single athlete at track this side of McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nAfter opening with a scintillating win in the 100 four nights earlier, he was trying to become the first man to complete the 100-200 double since Usain Bolt did it eight years ago.\n\nA troubling sign, however, came the night before when Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat, also to Tebogo. It marked the first time he had lost a 200-meter race of any sort since his disappointing third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nHe also hurried out of the stadium after that loss and went to the medical tent -- a rare occasion when he didn't stop to talk to reporters. His coach said he was fine.\n\nTurns out he wasn't. Lyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\nHe drank fluids, rested as much as possible and tried to gear up for the race. USATF said in a statement that Lyles was given \"a thorough medical evaluation\" and chose to compete.\n\n\"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe scene after the race was jarring. Usually one of the most energetic guys on the track, both before and after any sprint, Lyles collapsed, rolled onto his side and gasped for breath. He turned over on his hands and knees, then went to one knee, and balanced himself with his fist.\n\nHe finally stood up and wobbled toward the medics, signaling for a cup of water. Then, he left in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nIt will take time for all the repercussions of this race to play out.\n\nThere's still a chance Lyles could end up as the bigger-than-track superstar he set out to become after his disappointment in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThose Games, staged in front of no fans while the COVID pandemic raged, took a mental-health toll on Lyles, one he said made him less than himself and led to his disappointing finish in Tokyo.\n\nAfter he won the 100 Sunday night, he took that Tokyo bronze medal out during his news conference, dropped it on the table and explained it was the thing that motivated him to become a new person and a new sprinter for this Olympic cycle.\n\nThe 100-meter thriller sealed the first half of the deal. But instead of breezing through the 200, just getting to the starting line became a product of \"trying to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\"\n\nAs Thursday turned to Friday in Paris, Lyles took to social media and posted his thanks to fans for their supportive messages and his congratulations to Tebogo and Bednarek.\n\nHe also said \"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" where he was supposed to run the anchor leg in the final of the men's 4x100 on Friday.\n\n\"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart,\" he wrote. \"I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nThe spectacle Lyles headlined struck a sobering chord at a revitalized Olympics that were supposed to be all about the return of fans and the return of the Games as we used to know them.\n\nLyles reminded us that there will never be a \"post-COVID\" Games.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nTebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time.

His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race. This time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.", "source": {"uri": "krcrtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KRCR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@krcrtv.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://krcrtv.com/resources/media2/16x9/5452/986/center/90/66b3ecf9-7fbb-4d0a-8303-d3fcf9f1534d-AP24221678848784.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles stormed from behind to win gold in the 100m on Sunday night but was given no chance to do so in the 200m final by Botswana's Letsile Tebogo in a major upset at the Stade de France. Tebogo had time to thump his chest as he crossed the line in a new personal best of 19.46 seconds, ahead of the USA's Kenny Bednarek and with Lyles in third, a bronze adding to his 100m gold.\n\nFor Lyles, the dream of emulating Usain Bolt and winning both 100m and 200m titles at the Olympics did not materialise. It may have been over before the race, with the 27-year-old leaving the track in a wheelchair to alert suspicions that he was suffering from an illness. Within moments, US track and field officials confirmed Lyles had tested positive for Covid before the race but ran anyway. He was around half a second down on his personal best.\n\nBut even a fit and firing Lyles may have been powerless to stop Tebogo. The 21-year-old won Botswana's first gold medal at the Olympics and did so while dedicating a dominant victory to his late mother, who passed away in May. After crossing the line, Tebogo removed one of his orange spikes and held it up to the camera, revealing that they were adorned with the date of his mother's birthday.\n\nShe died at the age of just 44, following a short illness. Amid the shock and the grief, Tebogo didn't run for a month and considered quitting the sport, but she became the reason he continued and he represented her on the track in the biggest race of his life.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field,\" he said. \"She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy.\"\n\nTebogo had warned Lyles and the field of his talents, winning the semi-finals with the fastest time on Tuesday and beating the \"fastest man in the world\" just days after his coronation. Was Lyles suffering from illness then as well? It's one of several questions surrounding the American after he was dethroned. The 200 was his race, or as Lyles has put it: \"the 200 is my wife and the 100 is my mistress\".\n\nHis victory in the 100 took Lyles' stardom to another level, just as he said it would. That his victory over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson came by just five-thousands of a second and after not leading for the entire race was part of the show. Lyles was slow out of the gate but was the fastest when crossing the line, showing it's not how you start a race but how you finish.\n\nThe 200, though, was a safer bet: A three-time world champion, including back-to-back in 2022 and 2023, the 200 allowed him more time to build up to his top-speed. It's less about tactics than its shorter, more unpredictable cousin the 100m - usually, speed and endurance comes out on top and Lyles arrived at Paris convinced he was the best in the world in the combination of both.\n\nBut this was a new challenge: on Sunday night, Lyles had conquered the world, how would he follow the biggest night of his life when returning to the day job? Lyles had been unbeaten in 26 races across 200m before his semi-final on Wednesday night. If it was a statement from Tebogo that he was coming for his crown, then American teammates Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton could also pose threats.\n\nThe challenger in lane seven, though, was the one to watch. Tebogo was assured, leaning into his stride immediately as he set around the bend. Lyles found himself behind both Bednarek and Erriyon, but the bolt of light blue to his right was the bigger concern. With gold in his sights, Tebogo was running for something bigger and carried his mother across the line to make history for his nation.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ea6212de5b5987f60e00ffea92bd72ad", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nAn hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThe hurdler expected to challenger her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThis is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games.\n\nHe also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nAfter winning a thrilling 100 meters four nights earlier, Lyles came to the press conference, pulled out the bronze medal from Tokyo, slapped it on the table and said that had been his motivation to add the shorter sprint to his repertoire in an attempt to become a larger-than-track star.\n\nNow, he has two of those bronze medals, though the tale of this one played out much differently.\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of a race that, before this week, he hadn't lost since the third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nThis time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss. He won the world championship in 2019, 2022 and 2023. American teammate Daniel Roberts took silver.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

Later, wearing a mask as he spoke with reporters, Lyles said he had COVID.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed around in pain, staying down for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nTebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race.

And then Lyles left the track in a wheelchair.\n\nLyles appeared exhausted after finishing the race in third at 19.70, sitting down on the track as medical personnel made their way over.\n\nThe American star briefly got back up off the track and walked a few steps, then was placed into a wheelchair. NBC provided an update a few minutes after the race, indicating that Lyles had previously tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"As we saw Noah Lyles being taken off in a there wheelchair, I ran down underneath the stadium to try and find where he was,\" NBC reporter Lewis Johnson said. \"I ran into his mom, Keisha Caine, who was distraught, trying to find him as well. We found Noah Lyles in medical there being tended to, and she did confirm that Noah had been diagnosed with COVID two days ago.\n\n\"That's right, diagnosed with COVID two days ago, but he decided he was going to run anyway. Obviously what he has there, it may have affected how he performed. He is now, again, with medical people, and again, his mom is awfully distraught. But that's the issue. Noah has COVID.\"\n\nIn the day leading up to the 200-meter dash final, Lyles was seen around the track facilities wearing a mask.\n\nNoah Lyles has also battled asthma throughout his life, potentially further exacerbating any breathing issues. He certainly didn't quite seem to be himself on Thursday.\n\nThe 200-meter dash didn't get off to a great start for him.\n\nHe was a little slow out of the blocks and didn't achieve his normal top speed through the heart of the race. Lyles never led, working out of a middle lane. And he couldn't seem to unlock the extra gear he's capable of.\n\nInstead, it was American Kenneth Bednarek who was quick out of the blocks, recording a 1.93 in his first 10-meter split. Botswana's Letsile Tebogo was a hair quicker at 1.91, and it was Tebogo who would go on to win convincingly.\n\nThe 21-year-old Tebogo finished in 19.46, a solid 0.16 ahead of Bednarek, who finished with the silver medal.

What We Know About His Illness", "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- Noah Lyles said he tested positive for COVID two days before he finished third in the 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night.\n\nHere's what we know about the timeline of Lyles' illness:\n\nWhen did Lyles know he had COVID?\n\nLyles says he quickly got into quarantine after he had tested positive Tuesday morning. He participated in the 200-meter semifinal on Wednesday, where he finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak to reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95 percent when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWhat happened in his 200-meter race?\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana's Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn't lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nWhy was he allowed to run?\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nWhat races does Lyles have left?\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4x100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his relay teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nIt was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThe hurdler expected to challenger her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThis is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games.\n\nHe also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nAfter winning a thrilling 100 meters four nights earlier, Lyles came to the press conference, pulled out the bronze medal from Tokyo, slapped it on the table and said that had been his motivation to add the shorter sprint to his repertoire in an attempt to become a larger-than-track star.\n\nNow, he has two of those bronze medals, though the tale of this one played out much differently.\n\nLyles said he tested positive two days after the 100 final\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4\u00d7100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of a race that, before this week, he hadn't lost since the third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nThis time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nDavis-Woodhall and Holloway take two more American gold medals\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss. He won the world championship in 2019, 2022 and 2023. American teammate Daniel Roberts took silver.\n\nA javelin gold for Pakistan, and silver for India\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

Usain Bolt accomplished that double at three Olympics in a row -- in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. But until the Jamaican, no man had done it since Carl Lewis at Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nThe 200 is Lyles' preferred, and better, distance -- one at which he had not lost a race in three full years. That streak was snapped earlier this week at the Stade de France in a semifinal, where Letsile Tebogo of Botswana beat him to the line by crossing in 19.96 seconds, 0.12 faster than runner-up Lyles.\n\nBefore pulling out his narrow win over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in the 100 final on Sunday night, Lyles didn't finish first in his heat or his semifinal.\n\nAs anyone who pays any attention is well aware, Lyles is a showman who loves the spotlight and enjoys spending time with a microphone.\n\nSo it raised some eyebrows when Lyles skipped the interview area after Wednesday's run, and U.S. team officials said he was heading to the medical tent.

But that's the issue, Noah has COVID.\"\n\nAdditionally, according to The Associated Press, after crossing the line third, Lyles fell to his back and eventually sat up to be tended to by medical staff. A person familiar with Lyles' condition, who did not want to be identified, also told the AP was diagnosed with COVID two days before the final.\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and a year delay before the Games led to depression that he said hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nIt was a star-studded crowd at the stadium for the 200m and included Simone Biles, Mick Jagger, Snoop Dogg, Mikaela Shiffrin and Leon Marchand.\n\nLyles is still scheduled to compete in the men' 4x100m relay final on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikaela_Shiffrin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikaela Shiffrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mick Jagger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2165256680-e1723138226971.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nIt was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThe hurdler expected to challenger her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThis is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games.\n\nHe also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nAfter winning a thrilling 100 meters four nights earlier, Lyles came to the press conference, pulled out the bronze medal from Tokyo, slapped it on the table and said that had been his motivation to add the shorter sprint to his repertoire in an attempt to become a larger-than-track star.\n\nNow, he has two of those bronze medals, though the tale of this one played out much differently.\n\nLyles said he tested positive two days after the 100 final\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4\u00d7100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of a race that, before this week, he hadn't lost since the third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nThis time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nDavis-Woodhall and Holloway take two more American gold medals\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss. He won the world championship in 2019, 2022 and 2023. American teammate Daniel Roberts took silver.\n\nA javelin gold for Pakistan, and silver for India\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

Which makes him the opposite of Lyles.\n\nLast night, though, Tebogo dedicated his victory to his mother and shouted out his talent with his performance.\n\nTebogo was so comfortable at the front that he started beating the palm of his hand against his chest before he had even crossed the line.

A gold medal in the 100m -- the race he calls his mistress -- and now a bronze in the 200m -- the race he calls his wife -- is some performance.\n\nThe thing is, whatever your excuse, when you aim for the stars, when you win the 100m and say, 'Goodness gracious, I'm incredible', you better live up to it.\n\n'I'm pretty confident,' Lyles said ahead of the 200m final. 'I can't lie. I'll be winning. When they come off the turn, they will be depressed.' When you say that, you better back it up.\n\nLyles couldn't do it. He is a brilliant athlete but he is not a phenomenon, as Bolt was. The same goes for Jakob Ingebrigtsen. A superstar but way too fallible to be remembered as the greatest of all time.\n\nAs Tebogo celebrated becoming the first-ever African winner of the men's 200m at the Olympic Games, Lyles lay flat on his back yards from the line, gasping for air.\n\nLyles may be even more of an extrovert than Usain Bolt but he is a long way from inheriting his crown\n\nLyles couldn't do it.

Eventually, he hauled himself on to one knee and stayed like that for some time.\n\nHe began to try to walk back towards the athletes' tunnel but he could not make it and he collapsed against a wall and asked for help from medics.\n\nRead More Fans MOCK Noah Lyles for bold 200m prediction after American fails to land historic Olympics double\n\nSeveral crowded around him, helped him into a wheelchair and pushed it out of the stadium. A Paris 2024 spokesperson said Lyles had been unable to walk away on his own.\n\nRumours soon began to circulate that USA Track and Field had said Lyles was suffering from Covid-19 and Bednarek said he had heard his compatriot had 'some sickness going on'.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles confirmed he had tested positive for Covid in the early hours of Tuesday morning and had been quarantining at a hotel since and trying to recover.\n\nHe said he had recovered a lot of his energy by Thursday but did not want to tell anyone about his illness because he did not want to give his rivals an edge before the race.\n\n'I've had better days,' Lyles said afterwards, 'but I am walking around again. I was quite light-headed after that race.\n\n'The chest pain was definitely active. But after a while I caught my breath and had my wits about me. I feel a lot better now.'\n\nWhatever the reason for his performance, whether it was down to his failings, his illness or to the brilliance of Tebogo, Lyles never got close to his rival.\n\nHe might have won the 100m by five-thousandths of a second earlier this week but this time, he could not get within a country mile of Tebogo.\n\nGiven he was sick, it might perhaps have been wise to conserve some of his energy instead of sprinting out of the tunnel before the race like a man possessed by furies.\n\nHistory, after all, was on the line here. Only nine men have ever won the sprint double at an Olympic Games and it is an impressive list. Men like Jesse Owens, Valeriy Borzov, Carl Lewis and, of course, Bolt are on it and Lyles desperately wanted to join them in the pantheon.\n\nAfter his double at those World Championships in Budapest, he wanted another double here to set the seal on his greatness.\n\nThe only double he got was a second bronze to go with the one he claimed at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nA second gold of these Games never looked close to happening.

The Botswana sprinter subsequently called Lyles \"arrogant\" and \"loud.\"\n\nThe newly-crowned 200-meter champion was asked if he wanted to be the face of track and field, and claimed that his laid-back approach would not allow him to reach Lyles' level of fame.\n\n\"I can't be the face of athletics because I'm not an arrogant or loud person like Noah,\" he said.\n\nInsile Tebogo (right) called Lyles 'arrogant' and 'loud' after beating the American sprinter\n\nLyles confirmed after the race that he had COVID and was placed in a wheelchair\n\n\"I believe Noah is the face of athletics.\"\n\nThe comment caused Lyles' American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who won silver in the race, to briefly crack a wry smile.\n\nLyles boldly predicted before the 200 meters that he would complete the double after winning gold in the 100 meters in a nail-biting final.\n\n\"...None of them win. When I come off the turn, they're going to be depressed,\" he said.\n\nHowever, that prediction proved to be wrong as Lyles finished a struggling third and was placed in a wheelchair shortly after the race, clearly out of breath due to his COVID diagnosis.\n\nHe later revealed that the Olympics were likely over and thanked his fans on Instagram for their support.\n\nLyles was scheduled to compete in the 4\u00d7100 meter relay, but said he \"hopes\"[d] Everyone enjoyed the show.'\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nLyles (rear left) finished third despite being the outright favorite before the race\n\nLyles was clearly struggling to breathe after finishing third in the event on Thursday\n\nThe sprinter's mother confirmed to NBC that he had COVID before speaking to the network himself.\n\nHe told NBC, wearing a mask: \"I woke up early, Tuesday morning at 5 a.m., and I felt absolutely horrible. I knew it was more than muscle soreness out of 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse circumstances.\n\n\"I just took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much as I could. It would definitely take its toll, but I've never been so proud of myself to come here and get a bronze medal.\"\n\nLyles later said that the other competitors were unaware of his diagnosis: \"We tried to keep it a secret. The medical staff, my coach, my mother knew.\n\n\"We didn't want everyone to panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to keep it as discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors that you're sick.

Lyles was attempting to become the first man to sweep both sprints at an Olympics since Bolt in 2016, and the first from the U.S. since Lewis 40 years ago.\n\nChants of \"USA\" rang out as runners stepped into their blocks, then silence overtook the stadium. Running from the fifth lane, Lyles was behind by a sizable margin coming off of the turn into the homestretch. He had run from behind to win the 100-meter title four nights earlier but in this race, the gap was too big to overcome.\n\nThe result was a surprise because unlike the 100 meters, where Lyles had developed into a medal contender only during the past two years, he was the heavy favorite in the 200, his specialty. Lyles had won 26 consecutive races dating to 2021 until finishing second in Wednesday's semifinal -- also to Tebogo -- and had been 38-5 all-time against the seven other sprinters in Thursday's final.\n\nTo say Lyles entered the final confidence would be an understatement; \"I'll be winning,\" he had predicted four nights earlier, after his 100-meter gold medal. He vowed to leave his competitors \"depressed\" as they rounded the turn, halfway through. The opposite happened, as Lyles was clearly behind and having to work to gain any ground on Tebogo and Bednarek entering the homestretch. It was Bednarek's second consecutive Olympic silver medal.\n\nLyles entered the Tokyo Olympics as a favorite to win the 200 after dealing with what he has called lingering physical and mental-health struggles but left with bronze, a result he called \"boring\" in the moment. In the three years since the 27-year-old Lyles, who first gained prominence as a high schooler in Virginia, has openly showed vulnerability away from the track while also displaying few weaknesses on it. After earning his first Olympic gold medal Sunday, Lyles shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become.\"\n\nHis opportunities to win more gold are not over, but his bid to become the first man to win four track and field medals in one Olympics since Lewis in 1984 is done. The U.S. men have qualified for Friday's final of the 4x100-meter relay, and Lyles has lobbied for months to run a leg on the 4x400-meter relay, as well.\n\nAfter winning his 100-meter gold medal, Lyles stayed up until 2:45 a.m. Monday morning while rewatching his victory by five-thousandths of a second, getting a massage to recharge his legs ahead of his 200-meter first-round race later that afternoon, and carrying out what he called \"boyfriend duties.\" His girlfriend, the Olympic Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield, had forgotten her spikes at their massage therapist's room and asked Lyles to pick them up on his way back to the Olympic Village.\n\n\"So here I am at 2 a.m., waddling with a spike bag, my bag and some toiletries,\" Lyles said. \"I'm like 'huh, here I am, Olympic champion, 100 meters'.\"\n\nMaybe that wasn't exactly how he envisioned the aftermath of winning his first Olympic gold medal, but he laughed at himself as he told the story the next day. He wasn't expecting the 200 to end in a similarly unexpected way.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junelle_Bromfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junelle Bromfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-noah-200m-final-ch-1443-a5c99e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

He added that he never thought about not running after his diagnosis.\n\nLyles isn't sure if he will still participate in the 4x100-meter, but he said the Americans have the speed to run the race without him.\n\nOne day after losing the 200-meter semifinal to Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Lyles was unable to surpass him once again in the final Thursday night.\n\nTebogo ran an African-record 19.46 to earn the 200-meter gold medal. Finishing just behind him with silver was American Kenny Bednarek, who posted a 19.62-second showing.\n\nAs soon as he crossed the finish line third, Lyles laid down on his back on the track. Within moments, he was surrounded by athletic trainers and members of the Paris Olympics medical staff, who moved him toward a wall as they administered treatment.\n\nAt one point, Lyles was seen wearing a mask before being placed in a chair which was eventually wheeled into the nearby tunnel.\n\nJust after Wednesday's semifinal heat, Lyles did not come through the media mixed zone. He was taken directly to medical for an undisclosed reason.\n\nDuring Thursday's race, all eight runners got off to a somewhat even start. Lyles was in the hunt early. Around the 100-meter mark, Tebogo and Bednarek began pulling away. Although Lyles was still hanging close with them, Tebogo's lead was one he was not relinquishing easily.\n\nMinutes after the race, Lyles was also handed a yellow card for a violation of Technical Rule 7.1 for \"improper conduct.\" It wasn't immediately clear why he was given it, but during introductions, he did demonstrably jump onto the track as he heard his name.\n\nWhile pumping up the crowd before the race, Lyles smacked the box housing the speaker in his lane so hard that the number on the box fell off.\n\nLyles' 200-meter showing followed his 9.79-second, personal-best effort in Sunday's close 100-meter dash. He earned the gold medal in what was the closest 100-meter final since at least Moscow in 1980 -- or perhaps ever. Back then, Great Britain's Allan Wells narrowly beat Silvio Leonard in 10.25 seconds in an era when timing didn't go down to the thousandths of a second.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macon,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macon, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macon, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silvio Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allan Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0808%2Fr1370608_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Botswana's Letsile Tebogo won gold with Lyles' fellow American Kenny Bednarek taking home silver. Lyles finished with a time of 19.70 seconds, which was .24 seconds off Tebogo's winning pace.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles looked absolutely gassed, falling to the track as he attempted to regain himself. \"He looks like he is struggling to breathe,\" NBC Sports' Leigh Diffey said.\n\nMoments later, NBC Sports reported Lyles had been diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday, August 6, but decided to race anyway. COVID guidelines in Paris do not require athletes to isolate or miss events.\n\nLyles -- who was seen wearing a mask shortly before the race -- was greeted by medical staff who eventually put him in a wheelchair to escort him off the track. NBC reported Lyles' mother Keisha was \"distraught\" trying to find her son, who has a history of asthma, after the race.\n\nLyles won gold in the men's 100m final on Sunday, August 4 in a race that was decided by 0.0005 seconds. The American barely eclipsed Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who won silver. Lyles' Team USA compatriot Fred Kerley took home bronze.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles posted an inspirational message on social media to his followers.\n\n\"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression,\" he wrote via X. \"But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\"\n\nLyles -- who has never lacked for confidence -- said \"it feels good to back it up\" after winning gold in the 100m.\n\nWhile his eyes remained set on the upcoming 200m, he didn't shy away from discussing his post-Olympics plans, too.\n\n\"I want my own shoe,\" Lyles boasted after winning his first gold medal. \"I want my own trainer -- I'm dead serious. There ain't no money in spikes, it's in sneakers. And even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety we get...the fact that that hasn't happened, that's crazy to me. I was like, 'Yeah, that needs to happen.'\"\n\n\"The most misunderstood thing is the balance between cocky and confident,\" Lyles said. \"There is a strong line that people assume my confidence is cockiness. I will say this. Anybody who thought I was cocky and met me, they're instantly like, 'Oh, that's the nicest, coolest guy I've ever met in my life.'\"\n\nLyles continued, \"I never blame anybody who thinks that I'm cocky.

He participated in the 200-meter semifinal on Wednesday, where he finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak to reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95 percent when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWhat happened in his 200-meter race?\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana's Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn't lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nWhy was he allowed to run?\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nWhat races does Lyles have left?\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4x100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his relay teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 4 Jax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@news4jax.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/OADY4XCC5FGB5CRMBQ44YSOHLY.jpg?_a=DATAfRfiZAA0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won the gold with a time of 19.46 seconds, and Lyles' American teammate, Kenny Bednarek, won the silver with a time of 19.62. Lyles crossed the line in 19.70 seconds, well clear of Tebogo.\n\nLyles was taken off the track in a wheelchair, according to a Paris 2024 official, and was receiving medical attention after the race. NBC reported that he was diagnosed COVID-19 two days ago.\n\nThree years ago, Lyles was the heavy favorite in this race at the Tokyo Olympics. He finished third and broke down in tears while talking to journalists afterward. Lyles was diagnosed with depression during the pandemic, and the absence of fans in Tokyo sapped his energy. He opened up about this difficult stretch, then needed to be convinced by his coach and sports psychologist to run in the Prefontaine Classic a few weeks later, to get back on a winning track. Lyles relented, then won that race.\n\nRead More: Welcome to the Noah Lyles Olympics\n\nHe had been ascending ever since. At the 2022 world championships in Eugene, Ore., he broke Michael Johnson's American record of 19.32 seconds, running it in 19.31. Lyles defended that title last year, added the 100 m to his program and won that world title in Budapest, making him the world's fastest man, and then on Sunday, caught up to Kishane Thompson of Jamaica at the very, very last moment, winning the 100-m Olympic race by .005 seconds.\n\nLyles watched his memorable 100-m victory a few hours after winning the race, while receiving treatment. \"When I first saw it, I was like, 'Oh, I really was in last place,'\" said Lyles after running his first 200-m round on Monday. His reaction time at the start was tied with Letsile Tebogo of Botswana for slowest in the sprint.\n\nRead More: Omelets, Air-Conditioning, and Embracing the Emotion: How Gabby Thomas Won 200-M Olympic Gold\n\nBut Lyles couldn't go out and celebrate his victory -- he had to run the next day. And before that he had to report for boyfriend duty. His girlfriend, 400-m runner Junelle Bromfield of Jamaica, asked him to pick up her spike bag from their massage therapist, who has an Airbnb near the Olympic Village, and return it to her. \"So here I am at 2 a.m., waddling with a spike bag, my bag, and some toiletries,\" says Lyles. \"And I'm like, huh, here I am, Olympic champion, 100 meters, waddling in my girlfriend's room with all this stuff.\"\n\nHe'll return to the track, spike bags and all, for the 4x100 relay tomorrow night, to try to win his second gold of these games.\n\nBut Lyles expected more, guaranteeing to TIME before the Olympics that he'd win three gold medals. He displayed his usual showmanship before the race, jumping over the rail during his introduction, and knocking the lane number off his block when he struck it before the start. Coming into Paris, the 200 m was probably his surest thing.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefontaine_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prefontaine Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junelle_Bromfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junelle Bromfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabrielle Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mens-200-m-final-2024.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C68px%2C2400px%2C1256px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"I do have Covid,\" Lyles said. \"I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday. I woke up feeling chills, aching, sore throat. Those were a lot of the symptoms I have had before getting Covid. I was like: 'I need to test this one.' It came back positive so we quickly quarantined in a hotel near the village and they got me on as much medication as they legally could to make sure my body was able to keep the momentum going.\n\n\"I still wanted to run, they said it was still possible so we stayed away from everybody and took it round by round. I have definitely had better days but I am walking around again. I was quite light headed after that race and the chest pain was definitely active. After a while I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. I am feeling a lot better now. It definitely affected my performance.\"\n\nThe US track federation released a statement saying it and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4\u00d7100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nTebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time.

His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of a race that, before this week, he hadn't lost since the third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nThis time nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nYet Lyles gave little away when he came out for the race. He's known for his enthusiasm and it was all out there again.\n\nHe jumped and danced around the track, flapping his arms and screaming at the crwod. He booted his starter's block, and picked up a yellow card.\n\n\"I already had a bunch of energy. This is by far the best day I've felt out of the last three days. Still not 100%, but closer to 90 to 95%. That only works for one shot. I got to settle down for a while. It's one and done, there's no holding back,\" Lyles said of his pre-race antics.\n\nThe serenity of the eventual champion was a distinct contrast.\n\n\"It was really a beautiful race for me,\" Tebogo said. \"When we made it to the final, my coach just told me, 'Now my job is done, it's up to you to see what you can do. Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy'.\n\n\"That's all I could've wished for. I'm happy I finished the race healthier than before.\"\n\nTebogo runs with his mother's date of birth written on his shoes.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field,\" said the sprinter, who took a month off training and competition after her death.\n\n\"It gives me a lot of motivation.

What we know about his illness", "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- Noah Lyles said he tested positive for COVID two days before he finished third in the 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night.\n\nHere's what we know about the timeline of Lyles' illness:\n\nWhen did Lyles know he had COVID?\n\nLyles says he quickly got into quarantine after he had tested positive Tuesday morning. He participated in the 200-meter semifinal on Wednesday, where he finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak to reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95 percent when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWhat happened in his 200-meter race?\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana's Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn't lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nWhy was he allowed to run?\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games in China, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nFrance, which once had tight COVID restrictions, no longer has rules for people with the virus, just recommendations to those who test positive to self-isolate.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Tuesday that 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for the virus amid growing cases worldwide.\n\nWhat races does Lyles have left?\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4\u00d7100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his relay teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.", "source": {"uri": "recordherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Lyles actually lost both his opening heat and the semifinal round of the 100m, but he came back to pull off a victory by 0.005 seconds over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in the 100m final.\n\nNo matter what, there will be a new champion crowned in the 200m since the defending champion, Andre De Grasse of Canada, finished third in his heat and did not advance.\n\nBack in 2023, Lyles won the 200m at the 2023 World Championships with a time of 19.52, 0.23 second faster than the silver medalist, Erriyon Knighton of the United States, who is +2000 to win the 200m in the Olympics. Tebogo won the bronze in that race.\n\nIf bettors want to wager on Lyles, they'd need to bet $500 just to profit $100 due to his latest odds.

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, the Alexandria, Virginia, native fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nAn hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThe hurdler expected to challenger her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThis is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games.\n\nHe also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nAfter winning a thrilling 100 meters four nights earlier, Lyles came to the press conference, pulled out the bronze medal from Tokyo, slapped it on the table and said that had been his motivation to add the shorter sprint to his repertoire in an attempt to become a larger-than-track star.\n\nNow, he has two of those bronze medals, though the tale of this one played out much differently.\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of a race that, before this week, he hadn't lost since the third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nThis time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss. He won the world championship in 2019, 2022 and 2023. American teammate Daniel Roberts took silver.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

He participated in the 200-meter semifinal Wednesday and finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak with reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95% when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana's Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually when the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn't lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line, then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID-19 test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work.

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nAn hour after that shock, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-metre hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThe hurdler expected to challenger her hardest, Femke Bol, finished third, behind American Anna Cockrell, who finished 1.5 seconds behind McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nThis is McLaughlin-Levrone's second straight gold and also the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles's trip to the Games.\n\nHe also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nAfter winning a thrilling 100 metres four nights earlier, Lyles came to the news conference, pulled out the bronze medal from Tokyo, slapped it on the table and said that had been his motivation to add the shorter sprint to his repertoire in an attempt to become a larger-than-track star.\n\nNow, he has two of those bronze medals, though the tale of this one played out much differently.\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95 per cent.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of a race that, before this week, he hadn't lost since the third-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nThis time - nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 metres on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss. He won the world championship in 2019, 2022 and 2023. American teammate Daniel Roberts took silver.\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France. Nadeem set an Oympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 metres in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.

Okay, we thought we've seen it all during the Paris games but add this to the list. Just two days after revealing that he had tested positive for COVID-19, American sprinter Noah Lyles took home the bronze medal in the 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics.\n\nVisit streaming.thesource.com for more information\n\nHere's the nitty gritty ... Lyles finished the epic race with a time of 19.70 seconds, securing third place behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, who won gold with a time of 19.46 seconds, marking a historic moment as Botswana's first-ever Olympic gold medal. American Kenny Bednarek claimed the silver with a time of 19.62 seconds.\n\nBut wait, despite testing positive for COVID-19, Lyles remained determined to compete. He moved into a hotel to quarantine away from the Olympic Village and arrived at the track for Wednesday's semifinal wearing a mask. He chose not to disclose his diagnosis publicly before the race, stating, \"You never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may expect him to slow down in the lead up to the race but the 27 year-old Lyles appeared as energetic as ever when introduced before the final, displaying his signature enthusiasm by jumping and sprinting down the track as the sold-out crowd at Stade de France fell silent.\n\nIn a scary moment after crossing the finish line, Lyles collapsed and later asked for water while seated on the track. He was eventually placed in a wheelchair and taken away from the stadium -- a stark contrast to his triumph just days earlier when he won his first Olympic gold in the 100 meters by five-thousandths of a second. After that victory, he had boldly predicted that he would win the 200 meters as well.\n\nThinking on his performance, Lyles admitted that testing positive for COVID-19 \"definitely affected my performance,\" but he remained proud of his resilience. \"To be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID in three days. It's been a wild Olympics,\" he said.\n\nUSA Track & Field and the U.S. Olympic Committee released a statement on the matter:\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles was vying to become the first man to win both the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints at an Olympics since Usain Bolt in 2016 and the first American to do so since Carl Lewis 40 years ago. Nice company.\n\nHis run at more gold medals is far from done. In he upcoming 4\u00d7100-meter relay, Lyles said he would leave the decision to USA Track & Field on whether he should run in the final, for which the U.S. team had already qualified with the fastest time in the preliminaries.

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nMore gold\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss. He won the world championship in 2019, 2022 and 2023. American teammate Daniel Roberts took silver.\n\nA javelin gold for Pakistan, and silver for India\n\nPakistan's Arshad Nadeem put together the best meet of his life in winning the men's javelin at Stade de France.\n\nNadeem set a new Olympic record in winning gold. His throw of 92.97 meters in his second attempt smashed the old mark of 90.57 set by Andreas Thorkildsen of Norway in 2008.\n\nIndia's Neeraj Chopra, the 2020 Olympic champion, took silver at 89.45

We woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for Covid.\"\n\nLyles said the Covid \"has taken its toll, for sure.\"\n\nTebogo, 21, was able to ease up at the end and still clocked an African record of 19.46sec for gold with American Kenny Bednarek taking silver in 19.62sec and Lyles fading to bronze in 19.70sec.\n\nThe sole African to have won a short sprint title at an Olympic Games is South African Reggie Walker, over 100m at the 1908 Games in London.\n\nHis time saw him leapfrog American Erriyon Knighton to go fifth fastest in the all-time list. The gold was also Botswana's first ever at an Olympics.\n\n\"It was really a beautiful race for me,\" Tebogo said. \"When we made it to the final, my coach just told me, 'Now my job is done, it's up to you to see what you can do. Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy'.\n\n\"That's all I could've wished for.

Post-race, the 27-year-old was seen sitting in a chair and was wheeled off the track, raising concerns about his health.\n\nOlympic legend Michael Johnson, during his punditry for the BBC, dismissed the idea of an injury, stating, \"He certainly isn't carrying an injury because you can't do this with an injury, you can't run 19.70. If there's anything, there's some sort of illness that has zapped his energy.\"\n\nSoon after, it was confirmed by US Track and Field that Lyles had run the race despite testing positive for Covid-19.\n\nLyles had aimed to achieve a rare Olympic treble by winning the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay. After a thrilling victory in the 100m final by a mere five-thousandths of a second, he seemed poised to join the ranks of American legends like Jesse Owens, Bobby Morrow, and Carl Lewis, as well as Usain Bolt, in securing the triple. However, just as in his semi-final, Lyles was unable to close the gap on Tebogo in the 200m final.\n\nLetsile Tebogo's victory was historic, as he became the first African to win the Olympic 200m title, setting an African record and earning Botswana's first-ever Olympic gold medal. Tebogo, who previously won bronze at the World Championships and set a national record in the 100m, delivered a dominant performance, making him the fifth-fastest man in history over the 200m distance.\n\nKenneth Bednarek, with his second consecutive silver, finished in 19.62 seconds, while Noah Lyles, hoping to become the first American to achieve the sprint double since Carl Lewis 40 years ago, took third.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baller Alert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Morrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Morrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://balleralert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2159759798.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Lyles' mother told NBC Olympics that Lyles was diagnosed with Covid a couple of days ago.\n\nLyles came in third in the men's 200m final with a time of 19.70 seconds. Botswana's Letsile Tebogo won the gold with a time of 19.46 seconds and the USA's Kenneth Bednarek won the silver finishing with a time of 19.62 seconds.\n\nThe 200m is Lyles' premiere, preferred event and he's ranked number one in the world for it. Lyles needed medical attention after the race, and later he was seen by NBC Olympics in a wheelchair, as he mother told Lewis Johnson the runner has COVID. Lyles has been seen wearing a mask recently.\n\n\"[Lyles' mother Keisha Caine Bishop] did confirm Noah had been diagnosed with COVID two days ago. That's right, diagnosed with COVID two days ago,\" Johnson reported. \"But he decided, he was going to run anyway. And obviously, what he has there, may have affected how he performed. He is now, again, with medical people and again, his mom is also distraught. But that's the issue, Noah has COVID.\"\n\nLyles had a thrilling triumph in the 100m final on Sunday. The 27-year-old turned on the jets late to win the race by a fraction of a second, capturing his first Olympic gold medal and Team USA's first 100m title in two decades.\n\nUsain Bolt at the Rio Olympics in 2016 was the last male athlete to win both the 100m and 200m at the same Olympics.\n\nIt was a star-studded crowd at the stadium for the 200m and included Simone Biles, Mick Jagger, Snoop Dogg, Mikaela Shiffrin and Leon Marchand.\n\nLyles is still expected to compete in the men' 4x100m relay final on Friday.\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times. Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- will it be in the 200m final?\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times.

Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals in Paris.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal time overall behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nLyles already competed in the men's 100m and will be competing in the 4x100m relay as well. Here's what the schedule for that event looks like:\n\nAll of Noah Lyles' medal races will be broadcast live on Peacock and NBCOlympics.com.\n\nLyles' races will also be shown either live or on replay in primetime on NBC.\n\nNow Lyles currently has three Olympic medals: gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m at the Paris Olympics, and bronze in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics.", "source": {"uri":

When I come off the turn, they will be depressed,' he said.\n\nHowever, that prediction aged poorly as Lyles labored to a third-place finish and was placed in a wheelchair moments after the race, clearly out of breath from his COVID diagnosis.\n\nThe sprinting star's mother confirmed to NBC that he had COVID before he spoke to the network himself.\n\nHe told NBC, while masked up: 'I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've ben in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nLyles (back left) crossed the line in third place, despite being the red-hot favorite for the race\n\nLyles was clearly struggling for breath after finishing third in the event on Thursday\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Gold medal favorite for 200m COLLAPSES and reveals he has COVID - then hugs rivals despite infection\n\n'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much.

He took \"as much medication as we legally could,\" Lyles said. Lyles said he ran while on Paxlovid treatments.\n\nLyles fell to third place in his signature race, losing to 21-year-old Botswanan Letsile Tebogo, who won his country's first gold medal, and fellow American Kenny Bednarek. Lyles crossed in 19.70 seconds, well behind his standard and distant from Tebogo's 19.45-second masterpiece.\n\nAfter he crossed the line, Lyles began breathing heavily and laid down on his back. He slowly rose to sit, and medical personnel attended to him. Lyles unzipped his tracksuit and climbed into the wheelchair, fully conscious and regaining control of his breathing.\n\n\"Shortness of breath and chest pains were definitely active,\" Lyles said. \"But after a while underneath [the stands], I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me.\"\n\nLyles said he never considered pulling out of the 200 meters competition after his coronavirus test, which he said took place Tuesday at 5 a.m. Once he finished second in Wednesday's semifinal, Lyles considered that a sign he could continue. Lyles had won in every international competition since the Tokyo Olympics until he finished second in his semifinal Wednesday.\n\nLyles is still eligible to run in the men's 4x100 meters relay Friday night. He did not rule it out, but said he would let U.S. coaches decide.\n\n\"I'm going to be very honest and transparent with them, and I'm going to let them make a decision,\" Lyles said. \"I believe that no matter what happens, they can handle anything and everything.\"\n\nBoth the Tokyo Games in 2021 and the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 had strict covid protocols in place for athletes and most people connected to the competition. The Tokyo Games were held with no spectators as the world was still in the throes of the pandemic. The Paris Games do not have specific covid protocols, however, instead leaving it to athletes, teams and National Olympic Committees to decide how to respond to positive cases.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Earlier this year, the CDC rolled back much of its guidance, no longer asking Americans to stay home for five days after testing positive.\n\nAccording to a statement from the USOPC and USA Track and Field, the organization \"swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the well-being of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete,\" the statement said. \"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nEven before Lyles's positive test, at least 40 Olympians competing in Paris tested positive for covid in the past two weeks, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nWhen Lyles won the 100 meters Sunday, he captured the event his mother once jokingly christened his \"side chick.\" Thursday, Lyles won only bronze in the race Keisha Caine Bishop considered his \"wife,\" the bread-and-butter event Lyles has dominated on the world stage since he turned professional out of T.C. Williams (now Alexandria City) High in Alexandria. His pursuit of three gold medals ended with his second consecutive Olympic bronze.\n\nLyles won every 200 meters race he entered between the Tokyo Olympics final and Wednesday's semifinal, when he started slow and conserved energy on his way to second place. That hiccup could have cost him a preferable lane assignment, but he still started in favored Lane 5.\n\nLyles had declared his intentions - and brash confidence - Thursday morning. He borrowed a line from one of his favorite anime stories and posted on social media the Japanese phrase, \"Omae wa-mo shinde iru.\" Translation: You are already dead.\n\nIf Lyles was feeling ill, he didn't show it before the race. Instead he delivered his customary showmanship. As he warmed up, he jogged around the curve and cupped his hand to his ear. As he trotted back around to the blocks, he waved his left arm and asked the crowd for even more noise. When the public addressed introduced him, he charged on to the track, leaped over the barrier and bounded down the track some 25 meters, just like before his 100 victory.\n\n\"I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" Lyles said. \"I didn't have any time to save any energy.\"\n\nLyles suffered from serious asthma as a child, frequently spending nights in the hospital hooked to a nebulizer. He has experienced flares as an adult, but they had never affected him in competition in a major way. Lyles wore a mask in warm-up area.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What we know about his illness", "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- Noah Lyles said he tested positive for COVID two days before he finished third in the 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night.\n\nHere's what we know about the timeline of Lyles' illness:\n\nWhen did Lyles know he had COVID?\n\nLyles says he quickly got into quarantine after he had tested positive Tuesday morning. He participated in the 200-meter semifinal on Wednesday, where he finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak to reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95 percent when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWhat happened in his 200-meter race?\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana's Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn't lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nFeatured Local SavingsWhy was he allowed to run?\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games in China, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nFrance, which once had tight COVID restrictions, no longer has rules for people with the virus, just recommendations to those who test positive to self-isolate.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Tuesday that 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for the virus amid growing cases worldwide.\n\nWhat races does Lyles have left?\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4x100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his relay teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/25/6253aac9-b7bb-564e-b29b-b4dc0f029c3b/66b533608e56c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nList of sprint doubles at an Olympics\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nWhat's Noah Lyles' best time in the 200m?\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals at the Paris Games.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nWhat's the world record in the 200m?\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- could it be in the 200m final?\n\nWhen does Noah Lyles run the 200m final?\n\nLyles will look to become just the 10th man to ever pull off the Olympic sprint double when he races in the 200m final on Thursday, Aug. 8 at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch the men's 200m final at the Olympics\n\nThe men's 200m final will be shown on NBC and Peacock. It will also be available to stream here:\n\nHow many medals does Noah Lyles have?\n\nLyles enters the 200m final with two Olympic medals: a 200m bronze from the Tokyo Games and a 100m gold from the Paris Games.\n\nHe's also a three-time world champion in the 200m and the reigning world champion in the 100m.\n\nWhen is Noah Lyles' next race?\n\nFollowing the 200m final, Lyles is scheduled to next move over to the men's 4x100m relay. The relay event begins with the first round on Thursday followed by the final on Friday.\n\nSo there's a chance Lyles will enter the weekend with an Olympic sprint triple under his belt.", "source":

He said he had no regrets over competing, despite the inevitable risk of spreading the virus to other athletes, who he hugged and shook hands with after the race.\n\nThe USA star told NBC, masked up: 'I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've ben in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\n'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.'\n\nHe was asked by Lewis Johnson if he considered withdrawing and gave an emphatic response: 'No. No. We just said we were going to quarantine as much as possible and not try and pass it on.'\n\nNoah Lyles ran the men's 200m final in Paris with Covid, it has been claimed by his mom\n\nThe American needed to be wheeled away in the moments after the race in shocking scenes\n\nLyles was clearly struggling for breath after finishing third in the event on Thursday\n\nLyles did admit the virus could force him out of USA's 4x100m relay on Friday.\n\n'At the moment I don't know, I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,' he said. 'They have proven they can handle it without me.'\n\nMichael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to go ahead and compete, saying on the BBC: 'Very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It is just bizarre, the whole thing is really weird.\n\n'There is going to be all of this thing with the Noah haters out there - and he set himself up for it - there are going to be people out there saying it's not real and he's faking or whatever.\n\n'But putting that aside, having Covid and still coming out here and being in close proximity with other people - I know there probably is not a policy I guess at these Games for that - but morally I'm not sure about it.'\n\nThere are no rules that force athletes to withdraw from events, with all Covid protocols dropped for the Paris Games.\n\nLyles later said that the other competitors were unaware of his diagnosis: 'We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mum knew.\n\n'We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick. Why would you give them an edge?'\n\nNBC's Johnson revealed earlier about Lyles' condition: 'We saw Noah being taken off there in a wheelchair. I ran into his mom who was distraught.\n\n'She did confirm that Noah had been diagnosed with Covid two days ago but he decided he was going to run anyway.\n\n'I ran down underneath the stadium to try and find where he was. We found Noah Lyles in medical being tended to.\n\n'Obviously what he has there may have affected how he performed. He is now with medical people but that is the issue.

He arrived for the race wearing a mask.\n\nLyles tweeted earlier this week - after winning gold in 100m - that he is asthmatic, saying: 'I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression.\n\n'But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!'\n\nHe also took to X to offer Tebogo his congratulations on winning gold, saying: 'LETSILE TEBOGO congratulations. Ik (I know) you have had a very rough year off the track and despite that you overcame it all!'\n\nLyles' mother was described as being 'distraught' at seeing her son struggling afterwards\n\nMedics

American Kenny Bednarek earned silver in 19.62.\n\nFollowing his positive test, Lyles said he moved into a hotel away from the Olympic Village to quarantine himself and arrived for warmups before Wednesday's semifinal with a mask on. He said he never considered not competing in Thursday's final and intentionally did not disclose information about his diagnosis.\n\n\"You never want to tell your competitors you're sick,\" he said. \"Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nLyles, 27, appeared his usual energetic self when he was introduced before the final, jumping and sprinting down the track before getting into his blocks as a sold-out crowd inside Stade de France grew silent. Lyles was running from behind right from the start, looking little like the sprinter who had won 26 consecutive races dating to 2021 until he finished second in Wednesday's semifinal -- also to Tebogo -- and had been 38-5 all-time against the seven other sprinters in Thursday's final.\n\nAt the finish line Lyles collapsed, then gingerly stood while asking for water and sitting back down on the track. He was put into a wheelchair and carted off underneath the stadium. It was a stark contrast to Sunday night, when Lyles won the first Olympic gold medal of his career by winning the 100-meters by five-thousandths of a second and afterward guaranteed that he would win the 200 meters, as well.\n\nTesting positive for COVID \"definitely affected my performance,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything coming out and get the bronze medal with COVID in three days. It's been a wild Olympics.\"\n\nIn a statement, USA Track & Field said that it and the U.S. Olympic committee had adhered to guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and the International Olympic Committee to \"prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\"\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles was attempting to become the first man to sweep both sprints at an Olympics since Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2016, and the first from the U.S. since Carl Lewis 40 years ago. Earning bronze also ends Lyles's much-discussed ambition of becoming the first track athlete to win four gold medals at a single Olympics since 1984.\n\nHe said he would let USA Track & Field decide whether he should run on the U.S. 4x100-meter relay team that qualified for Friday's final with the fastest time in preliminaries.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DKzcp5PzE87_1rq1nv_Qfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/86e4af659f85c4abb8eed0a455cabe84", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy'.\n\n\"That's all I could've wished for.

Lyles' American teammate Kenny Bednarek won his second consecutive silver medal.\n\nGetting golds in the 100 and 200 at a single Olympics is a rare feat. Usain Bolt accomplished that double at three Olympics in a row -- in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. But until the Jamaican, no man had done it since Carl Lewis at Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nAt his last Games, eight years ago, Bolt was shutting it down late in his 200 semifinal, and suddenly realized Andre De Grasse was running hard. So Bolt dialed his speed back up and wagged a finger at the Canadian. Fast-forward to the final: Bolt won easily.\n\nThe field for the men's 200-meter final featured several contenders, including 2020 silver medalist Kenny Bednarek, 20-year-old sensation Erryion Knighton and Tebogo , who beat Lyles in the semifinals.\n\nLyles previously won the 100-meter final in a historic photo finish.\n\nNoah Lyles already had one gold medal to his name entering Thursday's 200-meter final\n\nThe American showman edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson on Sunday by five-thousandths of a second -- that's .005 of one tick of the clock -- in a race for the ages.\n\nThe final tally in this one: Lyles 9.784 seconds, Thompson 9.789.\n\nThe new champion said that before he left for Paris, one of his physio guys ensured him this race would be a squeaker.\n\n\"He said, 'This is how close first and second are going to be,'\" Lyles said as he pinched his thumb and his forefinger together so they were almost touching. \"I can't believe how right he was.\"\n\nFor perspective, the blink of an eye takes, on average, .1 second. That was 20 times longer than the gap between first and second.\n\nIt was so close, that when the sprinters crossed the line and the word \"Photo\" popped up next to the names of Lyles, Thompson and five others in the eight-man field, Lyles walked over to the Jamaican and said \"I think you got the Olympics dog.\"\n\nThompson, who raced three lanes to the left of Lyles and had no clue where he was on the track, wasn't convinced.\n\nRead More NFL star takes bizarre shot at Noah Lyles after sprinter's Olympics win\n\n\"I was, 'Wow, I'm not even sure, because it was that close,'\" the Jamaican said.\n\nTime would tell. It always does. When Lyles' name came up first, he snatched his name tag off the front of his bib and held it to the sky. Moments later, he shouted at the TV camera: \"America, I told you I got this!\"\n\nThe first four racers were separated by less than .03. The top seven all finished within .09 of each other.\n\nAmerica's Fred Kerley came in third at 9.81. \"That's probably one of the most beautiful races I've been in,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo finish, Kerley's orange shoe crossed the line before anyone, or anything.

We're hoping he makes a full and speedy recovery.\n\nIn the meantime, we'll wait for the Olympics to address this controversy surrounding Lyles' health.\n\nRelated: Video: Noah Lyles' Reaction To Losing 200m Final Is Going Viral", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_rosvoglou@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Rosvoglou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

What we know about his illness - WTOP News", "body": "SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- Noah Lyles said he tested positive for COVID two days before he finished third in the 200-meter final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday night.\n\nHere's what we know about the timeline of Lyles' illness:\n\nLyles says he quickly got into quarantine after he had tested positive Tuesday morning. He participated in the 200-meter semifinal on Wednesday, where he finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak to reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95 percent when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana's Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn't lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games in China, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nFrance, which once had tight COVID restrictions, no longer has rules for people with the virus, just recommendations to those who test positive to self-isolate.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Tuesday that 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for the virus amid growing cases worldwide.\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4\u00d7100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his relay teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

The 27-year-old American sprinter is battling COVID-19 and could not catch his breath.\n\nIt actually makes his bronze medal even more impressive than a gold...\n\nLyles talked a lot of trash before what is supposed to be his best race. He guaranteed a victory and said that it wouldn't be particularly close. That was not the case.\n\nLyles lost to Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and 'Kung Fu Kenny' Bednarek. He finished more than two tenths of a second back from the Olympic champion, which was a massive upset.\n\nLyles' time was .4 seconds off of his personal best. That big of a gap certainly didn't seem like a fluke, or just a bad day at the office. Especially on what is a pretty fast track in Paris. And it was at the Olympics, where heavy-flowing adrenaline typically provides an extra boost down the stretch.\n\nIt was the opposite for Lyles, who struggled to kick down the stretch and collapsed to the ground shortly after he crossed the line.\n\nLyles overcame severe asthma as a child and still deals with the disease today. He could not catch his breath.\n\nIt was glaringly obvious that something wasn't right.\n\nLyles wore a mask in the tunnel before each of his last two races. He lost an event as the heavy favorite. He could not breathe and needed a wheelchair. All kinds of mystery loomed over the frustrating result.\n\nHowever, it is actually remarkable that Noah Lyles reached the podium at all.

Noah Lyles claimed the bronze with a time of 19:70.\n\nAfter the race, a visibly fatigued Lyles was seen being carted off. It was later reported that he had been diagnosed with COVID-19 two days earlier, and Lyles was actually seen with a mask on before the 200-meter race:\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: USA Sprinter Noah Lyles Had To Be Carted Off After Getting Upset In 200-Meter Finals, And Everyone Made The Same Ruthless Remark\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his heartbreaking defeat, Noah Lyles revealed that he tested positive around 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, per ESPN's Coley Harvey. Lyles was quarantined in a hotel and revealed that he kept the COVID-19 diagnosis a secret to avoid giving his opponents an advantage:\n\n\"One, we didn't want everybody to go into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete. And then two, we wanted to be able to make it as discreet as possible. And, you never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nHoping to get himself close to full strength for the race, Lyles took several legal medications after the diagnosis. On top of that, Lyles said isn't sure yet if he will compete in Friday's 400-meter race.\n\nTebogo's victory marked the first gold medal for Botswana at the Olympics. Nijel Amos was the country's first Olympic medalist, winning the silver in the 800-meter race at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nThe three-time world champion long ago cemented his legacy as one of the all-time great American Olympians. Lyles also claimed gold in this year's games in the 100-meter race, and he should be applauded for a phenomenal effort today despite having to fight COVID-19 during the race.\n\nThe 27-year-old Lyles has nothing to be ashamed of, with gold and silver medals in this year's games already in his back pocket. Now, we wait and see if he'll be cleared and given the green light to race in the 400-meter event.\n\nAlso Read: More Crazy Photos Emerge Showing How Close USA's Noah Lyles Came To Finishing In Second After Dramatic 100m Olympic Final", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijel_Amos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nijel Amos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165916709-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- The first shocker came when Noah Lyles, the fastest man on Earth, won bronze in his specialty event, the 200-meter. Then, moments after race on Thursday night, the other shoe dropped: Lyles said he'd tested positive for COVID two days earlier.\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, Lyles looked ill, bent down to the ground, struggled to control his breath, and called for water. He was later seen rolling out in a wheelchair.\n\nLetsile Tebogo of Botswana won gold and Kenneth Bednarek came in second place for silver.\n\nIt wasn't revealed until after the race that Lyles -- fresh off winning the 100-meter sprint on Sunday -- had tested positive for COVID on Tuesday.\n\nOn the NBC broadcast after the race, Lyles appeared wearing a mask and confirmed the diagnosis.\n\n\"I woke up early, about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning just feeling really horrible,\" he told the Olympics broadcaster. \"Unfortunately, it came back that I was positive for COVID.\"\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic, you know, thinking I've been in worse situations -- worse conditions, I've felt,\" he said.\n\nHe said he never considered skipping out on the race.\n\n\"We just took it day by day, trying to hydrate as much, quarantined off,\" Lyles said. \"It's taken it's toll for sure but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here, and getting a bronze medal.\"\n\nUSA Track & Field confirmed Lyles' diagnosis in a statement to NPR after the race.\n\n\"In response, [the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee] and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" the organization said, adding that it has been following CDC guidelines to prevent the illness' spread.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles has one final event -- the men's 4 x 100m relay on Friday -- but said he isn't sure whether he will stay in the race.\n\n\"At the moment, I don't know. I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\"\n\nBefore the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France, the 27-year-old was hoping to go down in sprint double history -- aiming to be just the 10th man to win the 100- and 200- meter races in a single Summer Games.\n\nOnly nine men have pulled off the sprint double this before. One of those men -- Jamaican Usain Bolt -- did it at three straight Olympics. The last time an American managed the sprint double was Carl Lewis 40 years ago in 1984.\n\nAfter winning his 100-meter race, Lyles posted a motivational message to his social media:\n\n\"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression,\" he said. \"But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become.

Lyles needed medical attention after the race, and later he was seen by NBC Olympics in a wheelchair, as he mother told Lewis Johnson the runner has Covid. Lyles has been seen wearing a mask recently.\n\n\"[Lyles' mother Keisha Caine Bishop] did confirm Noah had been diagnosed with Covid two days ago. That's right, diagnosed with Covid two days ago,\" Johnson reported. \"But he decided, he was going to run anyway. And obviously, what he has there, may have affected how he performed. He is now, again, with medical people and again, his mom is also distraught. But that's the issue, Noah has Covid.\"\n\nLyles had a thrilling triumph in the 100m final on Sunday. The 27-year-old turned on the jets late to win the race by a fraction of a second, capturing his first Olympic gold medal and Team USA's first 100m title in two decades.\n\nUsain Bolt at the Rio Olympics in 2016 was the last male athlete to win both the 100m and 200m at the same Olympics.\n\nIt was a star-studded crowd at the stadium for the 200m and included Simone Biles, Mick Jagger, Snoop Dogg, Mikaela Shiffrin and Leon Marchand.\n\nLyles is still expected to compete in the men' 4x100m relay final on Friday.\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times. Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- will it be in the 200m final?\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times.

Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals in Paris.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal time overall behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nLyles already competed in the men's 100m and will be competing in the 4x100m relay as well. Here's what the schedule for that event looks like:\n\nAll of Noah Lyles' medal races will be broadcast live on Peacock and NBCOlympics.com.\n\nLyles' races will also be shown either live or on replay in primetime on NBC.\n\nNow Lyles currently has three Olympic medals: gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m at the Paris Olympics, and bronze in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics.", "source": {"uri":

Lyles was expected to win the 200m dash, but finished with the bronze medal behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and USA's Kenny Bednarek. Given his gold-medal victory in the 100-meter sprint earlier in the week, his loss is one of the most unexpected upsets during the 2024 Olympic Games. However, some have speculated that he was sick. Here are some potential reasons why Noah Lyles lost in the 200-meter event at the Olympics.\n\nWas Noah Lyles sick at the 200-meter sprint?\n\nIt has been confirmed that Noah Lyles was indeed sick with COVID, as confirmed by US Track and Field via BBC Sport in a post on X. After winning the bronze at the event, he was seen in a wheelchair.\n\nThere was speculation that Noah Lyles was sick during the 200-meter sprint, with many spotting that the athlete was wearing a mask before the event, which he didn't do before the 100-meter sprint.\n\nOther athletes during the Paris Olympics have decided to wear a mask as an extra precaution to reduce their risk of infection. Lyles finished second in Heat 2 of the semi-finals of the 200m sprint, also behind Tebogo. This led to speculation by fans that he was potentially sick or that his health was compromised in some way.\n\nAfter the 200m final race, Lyles was seen struggling to breathe and looked fatigued after his excruciating schedule running in the 100m sprints and the 4x100m relays. After falling to the ground, Lyles was briefly attended by the medical team.\n\nGiven the announcement that Lyles has COVID, it's very possible that he will not be able to participate during the 4x100m relay finals on August 9. He was not in Heat 1 of this relay, which had Team USA's Coleman, Lindsey, King, and Kerley participating instead.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_tan@comingsoon.net", "name": "Nicholas Tan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/noah-lyles-what-happened-200m-2024-paris-olympics-sick-mask.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 98, "textEnd": 106}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1717, "textEnd": 1725}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He is now, again, with medical people and again, his mom is also distraught. But that's the issue, Noah has Covid.\"\n\nLyles had a thrilling triumph in the 100m final on Sunday. The 27-year-old turned on the jets late to win the race by a fraction of a second, capturing his first Olympic gold medal and Team USA's first 100m title in two decades.\n\nUsain Bolt at the Rio Olympics in 2016 was the last male athlete to win both the 100m and 200m at the same Olympics.\n\nIt was a star-studded crowd at the stadium for the 200m and included Simone Biles, Mick Jagger, Snoop Dogg, Mikaela Shiffrin and Leon Marchand.\n\nLyles is still expected to compete in the men' 4x100m relay final on Friday.\n\nHow many sprint doubles at an Olympics have there been?\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nWhen was the last sprint double at an Olympics?\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times. Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nList of sprint doubles at an Olympics\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nWhat's the world record in the 200m?\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- will it be in the 200m final?\n\nHow many sprint doubles at an Olympics have there been?\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nWhen was the last sprint double at an Olympics?\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times. Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nWhat's Noah Lyles' best time in the 200m?\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals in Paris.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal time overall behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nWhat other events is Noah Lyles competing in at 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nLyles already competed in the men's 100m and will be competing in the 4x100m relay as well. Here's what the schedule for that event looks like:\n\nLyles' races will also be shown either live or on replay in primetime on NBC.\n\nHow many medals does Noah Lyles have?\n\nNow Lyles currently has three Olympic medals: gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m at the Paris Olympics, and bronze in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Her son, Noah Lyles, had been removed from the track moments earlier on a wheelchair. She was trying to find him after he took third in the men's 200-meter dash at the 2024 Paris Olympics but looked unwell afterward.\n\nBeside her was NBC track and field reporter Lewis Johnson. As they dashed down a hallway, Johnson turned around and gestured with his hands, making a wheelchair motion toward a volunteer, who pointed him in the direction of the venue's medical center.\n\nJohnson later described Caine Bishop as \"distraught\" during his update on Lyles' condition; the 100-meter Olympic champion received medical attention on the track and was breathing heavily (Lyles has asthma).\n\nConcurrently, a rumor started floating through the mixed zone: Lyles had COVID-19. Soon enough, the news was breaking everywhere. Johnson ran back the way he came from, toward his NBC camera station, while speaking on his cellphone.\n\nAthletes from other events and those who took part in the 200 began trickling through the mixed zone. Some, particularly those who competed shortly after the men's 200, were clueless about the news cycle that had just begun.\n\n\"Noah? I didn't know, wow,\" said Jasmine Jones, who finished fourth in the women's 400-meter hurdles. \"That's crazy. Congratulations to him. He's fantastic for that. That's really impressive. Congratulations. Hats off. Yeah, wow, I didn't know that.\"\n\nThat's because, Lyles later said while speaking with a mask on in the mixed zone, the circle of people who did know he tested positive Tuesday was small: just his family, his doctor and his coaches. Not even his teammates knew. He raced in the 200-meter semifinals Wednesday.\n\n\"I was going to compete regardless,\" Lyles said. \"If I didn't make it to the (200) finals, that would've been the sign not to compete.\"\n\nLyles showing up to the mixed zone came as a surprise. His publicist informed the media he would not be speaking and that the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, along with World Athletics, would be releasing statements. He'd disappeared from the cameras only to suddenly pop up again on NBC. He entered the mixed zone shortly thereafter.\n\n\"To be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything - coming out and getting a bronze medal with COVID,\" Lyles said.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the other athletes cared little that Lyles competed with the virus.\n\nThe winner of the race, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, first noticed something was wrong with Lyles on Wednesday. He noticed that the 27-year-old was wearing a mask and that the protection remained on his face during the pre-finals warmups.\n\n\"Not in his best shape,\" Tebogo said. \"He's going through something.\"\n\nA reporter then informed him that Lyles had COVID.\n\nThe most laid-back about the night's drama was Kenny Bednarek, the silver medalist in the 200.\n\n\"From what I heard, he's got something that went on. So, I don't really know what's going on with him,\" Bednarek said. \"I mean, I will probably talk to him after this to see if he's OK, which I hope so. But yeah, like for me, I don't really know. I'm kind of out of the loop.\"\n\nBednarek hugged Lyles after the race and said he was unbothered by Lyles' decision to race.\n\n\"I'm healthy,\" Bednarek said. \"I do everything I can to make sure my body's healthy.\"\n\nBednarek was asked if he had noticed an uptick of colds circulating throughout the athlete's village.\n\n\"There was a message that came out saying there was something going around,\" he said, \"but I haven't seen it.\n\n\"I guess I'm carefree.\"\n\nLyles said he'd rate his health anywhere from \"90 to 95 percent\" out of 100, though he wrote on Instagram late Thursday he believes \"this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics.\" (He was expected to run in the 4x100-meter relay.) He knew that he had one \"blow\" and that it could be used over those 200 meters. That didn't stop him from putting on his customary pre-race show, as he bounded out of the tunnel when his name was called over the stadium's loudspeakers during introductions. He bounced all over the track and even knocked over Lane 5's marker near the starting block in excitement.\n\nIt wasn't long before Lyles took bronze in his best event and he laid on the ground looking up at the sky. Then came the wheelchair - and a concerned mother looking for her son, trying to make sure he was OK.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "400 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_McLaughlin-Levrone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Clubs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/08/USAT/74729316007-usatsi-23947355.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4214,2369,x0,y81&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The rising star raced to victory with an African record of 19.46-seconds, denying pre-race favorite Noah Lyles of his second gold medal.\n\nLyles, who won the Olympic 100-meter gold in dramatic fashion, was tended to by medics after the race, who carted him off the track in a wheelchair.\n\nLater, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nTebogo dedicated his country's first ever to his late mother, who passed away last May.", "source": {"uri": "ksbw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSBW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_wiechert@ksbw.com", "name": "Brian Wiechert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-2165366498-66b52e18b6d0b.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0636xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

But he settled for third behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek.\n\nLyles fell to the ground after the race and was surrounded by medical personnel. He tested positive Tuesday, USA Track & Field announced. He reportedly visited medics after his semifinals heat Wednesday.\n\n\"I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal,\" Lyles said, in a mask, after the race.\n\nLyles finished with a 19.70, nearly four-hundredths back of his own personal best of 19.31, the third-fastest time in history. He still would've had his work cut out for him even if he were fully healthy, as Tebogo finished with a 19.46, faster than Lyles's gold medal time in the 2023 World Championships in Budapest.\n\nEven if Lyles won the gold Thursday, it was unlikely he would surpass Bolt's eight gold medals.\n\nUnfortunately for Lyles, he is running out of time to try to achieve the double in the Olympics, which Bolt did three times in 2008, 2012, and 2016. Lyles will be 31 years old by the 2028 L.A. Olympics, and Bolt was just weeks away from turning 31 when he won his third and final double in Rio.\n\nThe American still has other records to strive for, including a fourth world championship in the 200 meters -- tying him with Bolt for the most in history -- which he can achieve by the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.\n\nHowever, the Olympics showed that Lyles's competition is deep. The American won a photo finish in the 100-meter race over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson. Tebogo will continue to be a threat -- and perhaps win a double himself -- as he is only 21 years old and placed silver in the 100-meter event at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nPerhaps more important than a medal tally, Lyles has expressed he wants to break world records. Last year, he posted two target times on social media: 19.10 in the 200 meters, 0.09 seconds faster than Bolt's world record, and 9.65 in the 100 meters, short of Bolt's 9.58 world record but faster than anyone else in history.\n\nWhile the bronze medal adds to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, falling short of the double in the sport's grandest stage does hamper his ultimate goal of transcending the sport.\n\n\"After you get the medals, more and more people gain interest,\" Lyles said after winning the double in Budapest. \"You can go into fashion, you can go into music. You can start collaborating with people and start meeting bigger and better athletes. From athletes, you go to artists, and from artists, you go to the world.\"\n\nHe already expressed he wants his own signature sneaker -- a training shoe, not a running spike -- after winning the 100 meters Sunday. Bolt has signature sneakers with Puma, and contrary to what Lyles said Sunday, so did U.S. legend Michael Johnson, with Nike. They just didn't sell well.\n\nLyles has been with Adidas since he turned pro in 2016, though it remains to be seen how the brand approaches its partnership with the sprinter after his performance in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23946858-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles, the reigning world champ and freshly minted 100m gold medalist, is the odds-on favorite to complete the elusive sprint double.\n\nWhile Lyles is the projected winner, there is no shortage of intriguing contenders, including his own Team USA teammates Kenneth Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton, and the rising phenom from Botswana, Letsile Tebogo.\n\nHere is a look at the Men's 200 Meter Final Odds for Thursday, along with my best bets and predictions.\n\nMen's 200 Meter Final Odds\n\nThe Men's 200m final will feature runners from Botswana, USA, Dominican Republic, Liberia, and Zimbabwe. Reigning world champ Noah Lyles is the heavy favorite over rising star Letsile Tebogo in the Olympic odds.\n\nThe men's 200-meter final is scheduled for Thursday, August 8th, with NBC carrying the broadcast. Start time is 8:30 PM local time (CEST), which is 2:30 pm Eastern (EST).\n\nThe Men's 200 Meter Final odds for 2024 show American sprinter Noah Lyles as the heavy -450 favorite to win Gold in Thursday's event. The 27-year-old is on the cusp of Olympic greatness after clinching a dramatic gold medal in the 100m by a mere five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles now has his sights set on becoming the first man since Usain Bolt to achieve the elusive Olympic sprint double. Although Lyles finished second in his 200m semi-final to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, oddsmakers have full confidence in the Gainsville native pulling out the victory when it counts.\n\nLyles possesses the consistency and big-race experience to deservedly be heavily favored in the betting markers. The American sprinter has been dominant in the 200m over the past few years, winning three consecutive world titles in the event.\n\nLyles has a unique running style, with a high knee lift and powerful arm drive, which helps him maintain his speed through the curve and into the straightaway. Based on the odds, his implied chance of taking home gold is 81.8%.\n\nLyles' biggest competition on Thursday will be the aforementioned Tebogo, plus fellow American Kenneth Bednarek at +700 odds.\n\nCan Tebogo Do it Again?\n\nThe Men's 200m odds show Botswanian rising star Letsile Tebogo as the underdog to Noah Styles despite beating him in the semi-finals. The 21-year-old has been one of the surprises at the Olympics, clocking an impressive 19.96 seconds in the semis on Wednesday.\n\nTebogo was the only sprinter who posted a time below 20 seconds, which now has many questioning if he can pull a massive upset in the final. Oddsmakers don't think he'll get the better of Lyles again, setting the African with +450 odds, which is just 18.2% implied win probability.\n\nTebogo's journey to the Olympics has been marked by personal tragedy, adding extra motivation for the sprinter. He lost his mother, Seratiwa, just months before the Games. Tebogo has credited her for his dedication to the sport, revealing that he chose athletics over football to provide for his family.\n\nIf Tebogo gets out of the blocks clean and hits that top gear, we could witness the biggest 200m shock since a certain Usain Bolt burst onto the scene in 2008 Beijing. However, he'll need to take down a man who hasn't lost over the distance since the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMen's 200 Meter Best Bets & Predictions\n\nIt's really hard to bet against Lyles in the 200 Meter given his experience and track record in the event. However, while he's won the last three 200M world titles, he has a history of falling short at the Olympics.\n\nBack in 2020 at the Tokyo Olympics, Lyles was considered the favorite to win gold in the 200m but ended up with the bronze medal in a time of 19.74 seconds. Andre De Grasse of Canada won gold in 19.62 that year, but he's failed to qualify this time around.\n\nI'm going a bit off the board with a value sprinkle and longshot bet for the 200M. American Kenneth Bednarek is flying under the radar right now and is undervalued at his current BetMGM price (+700). Other sportsbooks have him around +500 to win.\n\nBednarek has showcased a very high ceiling this year, particularly at the United States Championships, where he ran an impressive 19.5 seconds. He was leading the race until the last meters before tightening up and losing to Lyles.\n\nKung Fu Kenny \"has already proven his ability to beat Lyles, having done so at Tokyo in 2020, where he claimed the silver medal with a time of 19.68 seconds. The 25-year-old has been steadily improving this year under the training of Dennis Mitchell, and I like him as a sneaky value bet Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType":

However, his appearance in the semifinals is leaving some fans concerned.\n\nRelated: U.S. Sprinter Noah Lyles Fails To Win 200-Meter Qualifying Heat\n\nLyles ran a 20.08 in his heat, finishing second behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, who ran a 19.96.\n\nWhile the same thing happened to Lyles in his 100m semifinal, the American's appearance is what is causing concern among fans.

After it was announced that Lyles is suffering from Covid, let's hope there are no long-term effects and that we see the 100m champion again soon.\n\nBut this was not about Lyles being unable to take the chance to become only the 10th man in Olympic history to do the 100m-200m double. This was not about Lyles' showboating and bravado coining back to bite him. This was not about Lyles failing to put himself into a historical bracket that includes the likes of Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt.\n\nThis was not about Lyles' claims to have iconic potential proving to be fanciful, to say the least. This was not about whether Lyles' illness was what cost him in the end - after all, he took bronze in a decent time of 19.70.\n\nThis was not about Lyles being beaten by silver medallist and American team-mate Kenneth Bednarek. This was not about Lyles getting a yellow card next to his name for something he did at the start, apparently.\n\nNo, this was about one young man, one ground-breaking athlete, one hero for his country and his continent. This was about as smooth a 200 metre run as you are likely to see and about a hugely unassuming runner, whose humility cannot fail to impress you. This was about Letsile Tebogo, of Botswana.\n\nTebogo only turned 21 in early June and, two weeks before his birthday, his mum, Seratiwa, passed away after a long illness. He promised to win gold for his mum and, on a wonderful night in Paris, he did just that.\n\nHe did it with an African record of 19.46 seconds and he never looked in a moment's danger of being beaten. It was an imperious run and this, don't forget, was the athlete who comfortably beat Lyles in the semi-final. It truly was a landmark moment in Olympic history.\n\nIt was not only Botswana's first-ever gold medal, it was Africa's first gold medal in the 200m. While all eyes were on Lyles to see if could emulate the like of Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt in winning a 100m-200m double (and the Jamaican did it three times on thespian, don't forget), Tebogo's fantastic form had him as favourite in a lot of judges' eyes.\n\nAnd from the gun to the tape, he blazed a trail that had Bednarek and Lyles in its wake. When he crossed the line, it was almost a canter.\n\nThis has to be one of the most exciting developments in African sport and win world athletics for a long time. While many were expecting a coronation of Lyles, this was the dawn of what could be a new era.\n\nAnd rather than Lyles joining that ultra-elite bracket, the possibilities for the young man from Botswana are endless. You have to feel a bit sorry for Covid-struck Lyles but this was not about him. This was about Letsile Tebogo - history-maker.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Lyles and Bednarek also claimed respective silver and bronze medals in the event at Tokyo 2020.\n\nTebogo's finish resulted in the first gold medal in the history of the Olympics for Botswana.\n\nLyles completed the first leg of the feat by becoming the first American man to win the 100-meter final in 20 years Sunday in Saint-Denis, France.

Tebogo then gained speed, slipping by Bednarek on the inside. Lyles tried to gain steam down the stretch, but could not match the pace.\n\nHe limped after crossing the finish line before going to the ground, showing signs of exhaustion. Several trainers then tended to the track star, giving him water and escorting him away from the track.\n\nSources later told NBC, USA Today and the BBC that Lyles was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier this week.\n\nTebogo also posted the fastest time (19.96) in the semifinal round for the 200.

He said that decision had not been made as of late Thursday.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time.

His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race. This time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go.

That time was good enough to earn the bronze medal. Fellow American sprinter Kenny Bednarek (19.62 seconds) edged out Lyles to claim the silver medal, finishing just behind Tebogo (19.46 seconds).\n\nOnce the race was over, Lyles was spotted laying on the floor. The \"World's Fastest Man\" seemed out of gas to say the least.\n\nLyles briefly picked himself up off the floor to grab a drink before going right back to the floor. It was a concerning scene considering he's a world-class athlete.\n\nYahoo Sports released a video that shows Lyles' reaction to finishing third in the 200m final.\n\nCheck it out:\n\nThe responses to this video of Lyles have been a mixed bag of emotions. Some fans feel terrible for him, whereas others are accusing him of being dramatic.\n\n\"Bro gets gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m and people wanna hate on the man,\" one fan tweeted. \"Surely y'all got something better to do than to trash a man's accomplishments.\"\n\n\"It's a 20 second race,\" another fan said. \"You lost, quit milking it brother.\"\n\n\"Bro thinks he's the main character,\" a third fan wrote.\n\nIt's being reported by a few news outlets that Lyles recently tested positive for COVID. That would explain why he seemed completely dejected after the race was over.\n\nOn the other hand, Lyles had his sights set on winning gold in the 200m. Many fans assumed he'd get the job done. Falling short of that goal must have put a hole in his stomach - figuratively speaking.\n\nRelated: Noah Lyles' Stunning Girlfriend Shared A Jaw-Dropping Swimsuit Photo", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_rosvoglou@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Rosvoglou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Lewis Johnson of NBC reported Lyles's diagnosis on the television broadcast. Lyles later confirmed the news in an interview with Johnson.\n\nHours after winning Olympic gold in the men's 100 meters, the U.S. record-holder said he woke up at 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning and felt \"horrible,\" before meeting with doctors and testing positive for COVID.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic and I was thinking, you know, I've been in worse situations and I've run with worse conditions,\" Lyles said. \"We just took it day-by-day trying to hydrate, quarantined off and it's taking its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for coming out here and getting a bronze medal.\"\n\nLyles is also in the relay pool for Team USA, but was unsure about his availability for the race. \"At the moment, I don't know. I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,\" he said. \"You know, they've proven with great certainty they can handle it without me, and if that's the case coming up today, then I'm perfectly fine saying, hey, you guys go do your thing.\"\n\nLyles wasn't able to match the closing speed of Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and American teammate Kenny Bednarek, who collected 200 Olympic gold in 19.46 seconds and silver in 19.62, respectively. Lyles crossed the line third in 19.70 seconds at Stade de France.\n\nThe three-time world champion repeated as an Olympic bronze medalist three years after making his Olympic debut in Tokyo.\n\nLyles is among several athletes who have competed with COVID at the Paris Games. In 2021, the Tokyo Olympic Games were delayed by a year because of the global pandemic and the Games were mostly held without spectators in the stadiums.\n\nAfter Lyles won Olympic gold by five-thousandths of a second in the men's 100 meters in Paris, the 27-year-old predicted another victory in his signature event. \"None of them are winning,\" he told the media. \"When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.\"\n\nHours later, the U.S. record-holder flew through the first-round heats of the 200 meters in 20.19 on August 5.

He was fresh off a gold medal in the 100-meter dash, and the 200-meter race was considered his best event.\n\nBut Lyles couldn't deliver on the proverbial \"Double\" and win gold in both races. He came in third behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and his USA teammate, Kenny Bednarek, after clocking a time of 19.70 seconds in the race.\n\nLyles couldn't celebrate his bronze medal win very long either.

After being handed a bottle, he went to the ground on one knee, appearing exhausted.\n\nLIVE OLYMPICS MEDAL COUNT:\n\nOverall table | Who is winning the Olympics? | Who's won the most gold?\n\nThe medical staff tended to him and eventually took him off the track in a wheelchair, leading many to wonder whether he was OK or if he was dealing with an illness during the event.\n\nHere's what to know about Lyles' health after his bronze finish in the 200-meter dash.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nFull Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters\n\nLyles' mother revealed that the USA sprinter was dealing with COVID during his 200-meter run, as detailed by NBC's Olympics broadcast. He was diagnosed with the virus two days earlier but decided to run in the event anyway.\n\nThe NBC broadcast said that Lyles' mother -- Keisha Caine -- was \"distraught\" after seeing her son taken off in a wheelchair. She was trying to find him after the race to make sure that he was OK.\n\nLyles spoke to reporters after he received medical attention. Clad in a mask, he revealed that he had quarantined after his diagnosis but \"never considered not running.\"\n\nBut what's next for Lyles? He is still weighing whether he will participate in the USA's 4x100-meter relay. He told the NBC broadcast if he has to choose now, he won't run, but he isn't ruling out participating if he feels better.\n\nLyles was spotted wearing a mask before running the 200-meter dash semifinals on Wednesday, which was the first sign that the U.S. sprinter wasn't at 100 percent.\n\nNow, track fans know that Lyles was wearing a mask because he had been diagnosed with COVID. He continued to wear the mask after running in the 200-meter race even though he wasn't seen wearing it before then.\n\nNonetheless, Lyles decided to run rather than opt out of the event. He still earned a bronze in the 200-meter dash -- an impressive feat but also a dangerous one considering that he not only had COVID, but also asthma.\n\nBEST U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\nTop 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens\n\nLyles had bad asthma as a child, a fact about which he has been open. He mentioned it in a post to X (formerly Twitter) after he won the 100-meter dash and hasn't been shy about sharing his experiences with others.\n\nIn 2020, Lyles detailed to CNN that he dealt with severe asthma issues as a child. It resulted in him being homeschooled and his mother making significant changes to their home environment.\n\n\"So, about 3 to 4, all the way to about 7 years old, I was dealing with asthma and asthma attacks seriously, like in the hospital, maybe every third night; coughing fits, constantly sick because my immune system was weak,\" Lyles said at the time.\n\nThat's part of the reason Lyles took extra precautions during the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. He did the same by wearing his mask after catching COVID in Paris, but his decision to compete certainly couldn't have been easy considering his health and chronic condition.\n\nFor those wondering why Lyles was allowed to compete with COVID, the Olympics is allowing infected athletes to compete in events in 2024. The event no longer has testing requirements for the disease either.\n\nThat said, athletes who feel sick \"are encouraged -- though not required -- to wear masks, wash their hands and avoid close contact with others,\" per the Scientific American. They also are granted access to single-person rooms in the Olympic Village while some countries \"provide separate transportation for sick participants.\"\n\nUltimately, it was Lyles' decision to run the race. He wanted to and decided to take a shot at winning gold despite dealing with the nasty virus.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homeschooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/Noah%20Lyles%20kneeling%20080824.jpg?itok=j6nToyjy", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your neighborhood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD\n\nTrending stories:\n\nMemphis Police Officer struck by stolen vehicle Family says 5-year-old girl put on wrong school bus Gunmen in car fire 20 shots into Frayser homes Mid-South Most Wanted Fugitives", "source": {"uri": "fox13memphis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox13"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/fox13memphis.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/81/9811f0ca-55bd-11ef-b018-531b10452d0e/66b51e6c259ce.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It's not the Olympics I dreamed of, but it left me with so much joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, right?

It would definitely take its toll, but I've never been so proud of myself to come here and get a bronze medal.\"\n\nAthletics legend Michael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to compete with COVID, telling the BBC: \"Very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It's just bizarre, it's all really weird.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of fuss with Noah haters - and he's exposed himself to it - there's going to be people saying it's not real and he's fake or something.\n\n\"But putting that aside for a moment, and despite having Covid and still coming here and being around other people - I know there probably isn't a policy at these Games, I think - but morally I'm not so sure.\"", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Chamley-Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Chamley-Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Noah-Lyles-2024-Paris-Olympics-are-OVER-the-American-sprinter.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nThe pursuit Noah Lyles had dreamed about and publicly stoked for years lived as he sprinted around the curve, the place from which Lyles excels like few athletes in the world excel from anywhere. And then his vision evaporated in stunning and alarming fashion. He left the track not celebrating a second gold medal, but breathing heavily while riding in a wheelchair.\n\nIn the aftermath of the race, NBC reported that Lyles tested positive for covid two days ago, citing an interview with Lyles's mother.\n\nLyles fell to third place in his signature race, the 200 meters, losing to 21-year-old Botswanan Letsile Tebogo, who won his country's first gold medal, and fellow American Kenny Bednarek. Lyles crossed in 19.70 seconds, well behind his standard and distant from Tebogo's 19.45-second masterpiece.\n\nAfter he crossed the line, Lyles began breathing heavily and laid down on his back. He slowly rose to sit, and medical personnel attended to him. Lyles unzipped his tracksuit and climbed into the wheelchair, fully conscious and regaining control of his breathing.\n\nLyles suffered from serious asthma as a child, frequently spending nights in the hospital hooked to a nebulizer. He has experienced flares as an adult, but they had never affected him in competition in a major way. Lyles wore a mask in warm-up area. He visited medical personnel after his semifinal, but his coach said he was \"fine.\"\n\nWhen Lyles won the 100 meters Sunday, he captured the event his mother once jokingly christened his \"side chick.\" Thursday, Lyles won only bronze in the race Keisha Caine Bishop considered his \"wife,\" the bread-and-butter event Lyles has dominated on the world stage since he turned professional out T.C. Williams (now Alexandria City) High in Alexandria. His pursuit of three gold medals ended with his second consecutive Olympic bronze.\n\nLyles won every 200 meters race he entered between the Tokyo Olympics final and Wednesday's semifinal, when he started slow and conserved energy on his way to second place. That hiccup could have cost him a preferable lane assignment, but he still started in favored Lane 5.\n\nLyles had declared his intentions -- and brash confidence -- Thursday morning. He borrowed a line from one of his favorite anime stories and posted on social media the Japanese phrase, \"Omae wa-mo shinde iru.\" Translation: You are already dead.\n\nIf Lyles was feeling ill, he didn't show it before the race. Lyles delivered his customary showmanship. As he warmed up, he jogged around the curve and cupped his hand to his ear. As he trotted back around to the blocks, he waved his left arm and asked the crowd for even more noise. When the public addressed introduced him, he charged on to the track, leaped over the barrier and bounded down the track some 25 meters, just like before his 100 victory.\n\nThursday night would not be like his prior triumph. It was another shock result, but not the one anybody wanted.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_kilgore@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Adam Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SFAWPK47PP72BQPUHZ3J77UKIA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The 200m finals start at 1:35 p.m. Eastern on NBC and Peacock.\n\nIf you don't have cable, don't sweat it. Several streaming services will broadcast the event live, and you can watch for free on Fubo and DirecTV Stream, which both offer a free trial to new users. Sling, which has promotional pricing offers, is another option.\n\nPeacock, NBC's streaming service, is also broadcasting all Olympic events. While it does not offer a free trial, fans can sign up for a premium package starting at $7.99/month.\n\nLyles has already won one gold medal this summer in the 100-meter final. He comes into the race with a personal-best time of 19.31 seconds, tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His best time this season is 19.53 seconds set at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nIn addition to his other international competitors, Lyles will also be competing against two fellow Americans - \"Kung Fu\" Kenny Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton.\n\nHere's a further preview of today's race, courtesy of the Associated Press:\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France (AP) -- What was supposed to be the easy half of Noah Lyles' historic Olympic sprint double isn't looking quite so easy anymore.\n\nNewly crowned the Fastest Man Alive after a close-as-can-be win by five thousandths of a second in the 100 meters at the 2024 Games, Lyles was not even the fastest man in his semifinal of the 200 on Wednesday night. He was good enough to make it into that event's final, anyway.\n\nThe 200 is Lyles' preferred, and better, distance -- one at which he had not lost a race in three full years. That streak was snapped at the Stade de France, where Letsile Tebogo of Botswana beat him to the line by crossing in 19.96 seconds, 0.12 faster than runner-up Lyles.\n\nThey'll have a rematch for the gold on Thursday night.\n\nGetting golds in the 100 and 200 at a single Olympics is a rare feat. Usain Bolt accomplished that double at three Olympics in a row -- in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. But until the Jamaican, no man had done it since Carl Lewis at Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nAt his last Games, eight years ago, Bolt was shutting it down late in his 200 semifinal, and suddenly realized Andre De Grasse was running hard. So Bolt dialed his speed back up and wagged a finger at the Canadian. Fast-forward to the final: Bolt won easily.\n\nBefore pulling out his narrow win over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in the 100 final on Sunday night, Lyles didn't finish first in his heat or his semifinal.\n\nAs anyone who pays any attention is well aware, Lyles is a showman who loves the spotlight and enjoys spending time with a microphone.\n\nThat's obvious from his mean-mugging and gesturing on the purple track in Paris before he runs or such statements as the off-hand comparison between track and the NBA that went viral last year: \"The thing that hurts me the most is I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'World Champion' on their head,\" Lyles said. \"World champion of what? The United States?\"\n\nSo it raised some eyebrows when Lyles skipped the interview area after Wednesday's run, and U.S. team officials said he was heading to the medical tent. His coach, Lance Brauman, told The Associated Press: \"He's fine.\"\n\nThat might just add a bit more intrigue in the 24 hours until the medals are at stake.\n\nThere already was plenty.\n\nIs Lyles, a 27-year-old from Florida, at his best? How much did he care about the semifinal, when lane placements are determined but all that truly matters is moving on to the round that determines the medals? Will Lyles find some extra fuel from being outdone in front of a full house of about 80,000?\n\nWas the 21-year-old Tebogo, the 200 bronze medalist at worlds but making his Olympic debut, trying to send a message? Is he ready to challenge for a gold?\n\nAnd what about Kenny Bednarek, Lyles' U.S. teammate and the Tokyo Games silver medalist, who ran in a different semifinal and won it in 20 seconds flat, the evening's second-fastest time? Or Erryion Knighton, a 20-year-old American seen as the next threat, but whose only victories over Lyles came in the opening rounds of the 2021 Olympic trials.\n\nAt the last Olympics, Lyles finished behind Bednarek and champion De Grasse in the 200. On Wednesday, De Grasse was third in Bednarek's heat with a time too slow to reach the final.\n\nAfterward, De Grasse mentioned a hamstring issue that resurfaced. He also was asked about his American coach, Rana Reider, getting kicked out of the Paris Games after the Canadian Olympic Committee said it \"learned of new information about the appropriateness of Mr. Reider remaining accredited.\" Reider was investigated for alleged sexual misconduct by the U.S. Center for SafeSport and placed on a one-year probation that ended in May.\n\n\"I tried to keep my head and stay mentally strong,\" De Grasse said, \"but of course, that's always a tough one, not having your coach out there with you.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news",

It was then revealed he had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nAfter crossing the line third in the 200 meters for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and eventually sat up to be tended to by medical staff.\n\nIn an interview after the race, Lyles confirmed he had been diagnosed with COVID two days earlier.\n\n\"Yeah, I woke up early about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning and, you know, I just was feeling really horrible and I knew it was more than just being sore from the 100. We tested and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for COVID.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic and I was thinking I've been in worse situations, I've run with worse conditions I felt and we just took it day by day and trying to hydrate as much quarantined off. I definitely say that it's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and, and getting a bronze medal where last Olympics, I was very disappointed.\"\n\nWhile Lyles said he never considered skipping the 200-meter final, he's not sure whether he'll race in the 4x100m relay.\n\n\"At the moment I don't know, I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They're proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\"\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the men's 4x100 relay Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said that decision had not been made as of late Thursday.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and a year delay before the Games led to depression that he said hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nMinutes before the men's 200-meter final, Lyles was seen wearing a medical mask on the TV broadcast of the race.\n\nThe athlete, who was named the World's Fastest Man after clinching gold in the 100-meter dash, was spotted with a mask during the semifinal round on Wednesday.\n\nLyles isn't the first Olympian to be impacted by COVID at the Paris Games.

We woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately it came up that I was positive for COVID.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic. I was thinking I've been in worse situations, I've run with worse conditions I felt and we just took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much, quarantined off. I'd definitely say that it's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal where last Olympics I was very disappointed, and this time I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nHowever, Lyles still has some races in the tank.

He was dealing with a legitimate illness.\n\nThe 27-year-old American sprinter has COVID.\n\nTeam USA announced that Lyles, who won gold in the men's 100m dash on Sunday, has been diagnosed with the illness. Lyles, who won bronze in the men's 200m dash in Tokyo in 2021, won the bronze medal in the Stade de France on Thursday. He ran a 19.70, finishing in third behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana who won gold (running a 19.46) and Kenny Bednarek of the United States (who ran a 19.62).\n\nLyles was visibly shaken after the race. He immediately went to the ground and called for the trainers, asking for water. Lyles was then escorted out of the arena in a wheelchair.\n\nLyles did not appear to be at 100 percent heading into the men's 200m final. He was seen wearing a mask before his semifinal race on Wednesday, when he surprisingly finished in second place in his heat.\n\nThis image sparked concerns, with many wondering if Lyles, who has dealt with severe asthma since he was a kid, was dealing with a flareup or some kind of illness.\n\nNow, we appear to know that he was legitimately sick.\n\nLyles' Summer Olympics are probably done if he has COVID-19, as he likely won't be running in the men's 4x100 relay on Friday, given the circumstances.\n\nOur thoughts are with the Alexandria, Virginia native as he deals with this illness. It's honestly pretty impressive that he managed to run a sub-20.0 and win a medal amid the illness.\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics will continue on NBC and Peacock, along with USA Network and E!, this weekend.\n\nRelated: U.S. Track Star Noah Lyles Is Dating A Fellow Olympian", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_holleran@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Holleran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

We woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately it came up that I was positive for COVID.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic.

Lyles is a double world champion over the distance and had won his last 26 races. But on a still-warm evening at the Stade de France, the American sprint king was beaten to the line in his Olympic semi-final by African champion Letsile Tebogo.\n\nPerhaps it is more accurate to say Lyles finished second, given he comfortably qualified for Thursday night's final. Both men eased up in the final 20m with the finish in sight and energy to conserve. But they were flat out around the bend, where Tebogo burned into the lead, and perhaps it was a sign that Lyles will not have it all his own way.\n\nOnly four men have won the triple of 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold at the Olympic games. After winning the 100m crown by five thousandths of a second on Monday night, Lyles is bidding to join a list of American icons: the great Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), who managed to make sprinting look like a light jog in the park, Carl Lewis (1984) and, of course, Usain Bolt (2012 and 2016).\n\nRelays are an unpredictable business, but if USA get the baton round cleanly then they should have too much for the reigning Olympic champions Italy, Canada, Britain and the rest. The question is whether Lyles will be on the startline with two gold medals already around his neck.\n\nNot if Tebogo can help it. The 21-year-old Botswanan has a stack of age-group records including the fastest 200m time ever by a teenager. He was the only man in these three semi-finals to run under 20 seconds, clocking 19.96 sec at a breeze, and his personal best of 19.50 could trouble Lyles, especially if the American gets a sluggish start.\n\nTebogo finished only sixth in the 100m final but the longer distance is about hitting maximum speed and maintaining it, and here Tebogo is in his element. His top speed of 27.92mph was higher than all of the other finalists (Lyles was second with 27.84).\n\nThe most impressive semi-finalist beyond those two was another American, Kenny Bednarek, the 200m specialist who won silver three years ago in Tokyo, ahead of Lyles who took bronze. Bednarek cruised through the line looking very comfortable in his white bandana as he clocked 20.00 sec. He glanced at the screen, shrugged and walked away.\n\nThe third semi-final was one by Erriyon Knighton, another American, who three years ago in Tokyo was being tipped as the future of sprinting when still just 17. He finished fourth in the final there and has since lowered his personal best to 19.49. Knighton is under scrutiny after failing an anti-doping test, only to be cleared after claiming to have ingested contaminated meat.\n\nIf Lyles can beat them he will join esteemed company in the history of American athletics.

Lyles was third across the line in 19.70 seconds.\n\nAfter the race Lyles, who has battled asthma, sat on the track winded and received medical treatment.\n\nMedical personnel wheeled Lyles down a hallway deep beneath the stands at Stade de France. As he was taken by wheelchair for examination, someone asked if he wanted to call his mother. He shook his head.\n\n\"I just needed some time,\" he said. \"So they wheeled me off the track. \"\n\nA minute later, his mother rushed down the hallway after him.\n\nNBC was the first to report his mother confirmed Lyles was diagnosed with COVID two days earlier but still was committed to running.\n\n\"I woke up in the middle of the night [Tuesday] just feeling really chills, aching, sore throat and those are kind of a lot of the symptoms I've always had right before getting COVID,\" Lyles told reporters while wearing a mask after the race.\n\nHe said he moved to a hotel away from the Athletes Village and took as much Paxlovid as allowed by international track rules. His team did not tell anyone about his test result.\n\nLyles said his team didn't tell anyone about his illness, but took precautions to avoid spreading it. He said felt better Thursday and entered the race at about 90% strength. He told NBC he never considered skipping the 200-meter final\n\n\"To be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out and getting the bronze medal,\" he told reporters.\n\nHe isn't the only athlete who has competed after testing positive for COVID in Paris.\n\nThe COVID safety restrictions that dramatically altered the Tokyo Olympics were abandoned for the Paris Olympics and mask use among athletes has been limited. There are no COVID testing requirements and the disease has been treated like any other respiratory illness. Olympic officials allow athletes and delegations to decide how to handle infections, urging those who feel ill to seek medical treatment. Isolation rooms for those who are ill are available at the Athletes Village.\n\nBritish swimmer Adam Peaty and Australian swimmers Lani Pallister and Zac Stubblety-Cook have all competed with COVID during the Paris Olympics.\n\nLyles chose to join them, lining up for the 200-meter final.\n\nThe last man to accomplish the Olympic triple Lyles sought was Usain Bolt, who did it twice, at London 2012 and Rio 2016.\n\nLyles has another shot at gold in the 4x100 relay Friday, but he told NBC he was leaning against participating in the race.\n\n\"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,\" Lyles said. \"... You guys have more than enough speed to handle it and get the gold medal.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals in Paris.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal time overall behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- will it be in the 200m final?\n\nLyles will look to become just the 10th man to ever pull off the Olympic sprint double when he races in the 200m final on Thursday, Aug. 8 at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe men's 200m final will be shown on NBC and Peacock. It will also be available to stream here:\n\nLyles enters the 200m final with two Olympic medals: a 200m bronze from the Tokyo Games and a 100m gold from the Paris Games.\n\nHe's also a three-time world champion in the 200m and the reigning world champion in the 100m.\n\nFollowing the 200m final, Lyles is scheduled to next move over to the men's 4x100m relay. The relay event begins with the first round on Thursday followed by the final on Friday.\n\nSo there's a chance Lyles will enter the weekend with an Olympic sprint triple under his belt.", "source":

He said he had no regrets about competing, despite the inevitable risk of spreading the virus to other athletes, whom he hugged and shook hands with after the race.\n\nSpeaking to NBC, he wore a mask and said, \"I woke up early, Tuesday morning at 5 a.m., and I felt absolutely horrible. I knew it was more than just muscle aches out of 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse circumstances.\n\n\"I just took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much as I could. It definitely took its toll, but I've never been so proud of myself coming here and getting a bronze medal.\"\n\nAsked if he was considering withdrawing, Lewis Johnson gave a firm answer: 'No. No. We just said we would quarantine ourselves as much as possible and try not to pass on the virus.'\n\nNoah Lyles ran men's 200m final in Paris with Covid, his mother claims\n\nThe American had to be driven away in shocking scenes in the moments after the race\n\nLyles was clearly struggling to breathe after finishing third in the event on Thursday\n\nMoments earlier, NBC's Johnson revealed Lyles' condition: \"We saw Noah being taken out of there in a wheelchair. I ran into his mother, who was very upset.\n\n'She confirmed that Noah was diagnosed with Covid two days ago, but he decided to go for a run anyway.\n\n\"I ran under the stadium to see where he was. We found Noah Lyles in the medical bay, where he was being treated.\n\n\"Clearly what he has there could have affected how he performed. He's with the medical staff now, but that's the problem. Noah has Covid.\"\n\nThe American star made his trademark theatrical entrance at the race, jumping into the stadium when his name was called and shouting to the crowd that he would win the race, as many considered him the favorite.\n\nBut after being passed by gold-winning Letsile Tebogo and fellow Australian Kenny Bednarek, Lyles was found on the track, panting and gasping for breath, after congratulating his fellow competitors.\n\nMoments later, he was photographed needing a wheelchair to get off the track, arriving for the race wearing a mask.\n\nLyles tweeted earlier this week - after winning gold in the 100 meters - that he has asthma.\n\nMichael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to go ahead and take part, telling the BBC: \"It's very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It's just bizarre, it's all really weird.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of fuss with Noah haters - and he's exposed himself to it - there's going to be people saying it's not real and he's fake or something.\n\n\"But if we put that aside for a moment, and despite COVID, we still come here and are around other people -- I know there probably isn't a policy for this at these Games -- but morally I'm not so sure.\"\n\nBut the American star was seen hugging gold medalist Letsile Tebogo before turning heads\n\nLyles was seen wearing a mask just before his match in Paris started\n\nDoctors rush to help Lyles after he falls to the ground and struggles to breathe\n\nLyles was seen shaking hands and hugging his competitors before collapsing to the ground.\n\nEarlier this week it was reported that more than 40 athletes had tested positive for the virus.\n\nBritish swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive a day after winning silver in the 100m breaststroke while feeling unwell, his team said.\n\nAustralian medal contender Lani Pallister withdrew from the women's 1500m freestyle due to illness.\n\nMORE TO FOLLOW", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY

He placed bronze, adding a second medal to his trophy case after winning gold in the 100-meter final on Sunday.\n\nHowever, Lyles dropped to a knee shortly after the 100-meter race ended and was visibly unwell. The sight led the NBC broadcast to reveal the sensational sprinter had tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nThe Paris Olympics do not have anything resembling strict COVID protocols, so Lyles did not break any rules by particpating in Thursday's race. In fact, he reportedly isn't even the first athlete to participate in the 2024 Games while positive for COVID. But between the news of the diagnosis going public and Lyles' clear struggles after the race, it's natural to wonder if he will be part of his next scheduled event.\n\nLyles is supposed to be part of the 4x100 men's relay team, scheduled to participate in the final on Friday afternoon. Will he participate in light of his COVID diagnosis?\n\nWill Noah Lyles Run in the 4x100 Meter Race at the Olympics?\n\nLyles himself was asked this question by NBC's Lewis Johnson shortly after the conclusion of the 200-meter final.\n\n\"At the moment, I don't know,\" Lyles said. \"Right now I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty they can handle it without me. If that's the case coming off today, then I'm perfectly fine saying, 'Hey, you guys go do your thing. You guys have got more than enough speed to handle it and get the gold medal.'\"\n\nTo Lyles' last point, the 4x100 team had to qualify today without his help. As Lyles prepared for the 200-meter final, Team USA dominated and finished well ahead of any other country in the qualifying heat to reach the final.\n\nRight now, it seems up in the air whether Lyles will be good to go tomorrow. But he seems confident Team USA is in good hands regardless.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Will Noah Lyles Run in the 4x100 Meter Race at the Olympics?.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_mckeone@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Liam McKeone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/gc5xwv/picture290889644/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/d1b57661-6195-416b-bea8-a2eaf7c3b353", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

and he remains the only man to ever enjoy such a dominant streak.\n\nLyles had targeted a remarkable four golds in Paris, including both the 4x100m and 4x400m relays, but it remains to be seen whether he will be fit to contest those finals.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--vvwkzEtH--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1723147089/4KLQ8J4_000_36CR796_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

This victory took place on Sunday, marking a historic moment in the competition.\n\nDebilitating Symptoms and Race Results\n\nHowever, just four days post-victory, Lyles was seen being assisted off the track in a wheelchair during the 200 meters final, where Botswana's Letsile Tebogo emerged as the champion. Lyles received the positive Covid-19 test early on Tuesday morning.\n\nLyles commented, \"It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks,\" conveying the difficulties he faced in managing the illness during the race. He later added, \"I was coughing through the night. I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\" He described feeling lightheaded, experiencing shortness of breath, and having chest pains following the race. \"I'm a lot better now,\" he reassured.\n\nUnexpected Challenges on a Bright Day\n\nUpon entering the track, Lyles showcased his typical enthusiasm, engaging the crowd as he sought to be among only ten individuals to win both the 100 meters and 200 meters gold medals at one Olympic Games. Following last year's impressive performance, where he won three gold medals at the World Championships, Lyles was optimistic heading into the race.\n\nDuring the final, despite a sluggish start, Lyles found himself unable to catch up with the frontrunners, finishing third behind silver medalist Kenneth Bednarek. It was not until after the race that observers recognized the extent of his struggle, as Lyles showed visible signs of distress.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this close to the chest,\" Lyles noted about his secret Covid diagnosis. He explained, \"The people who knew were the medical staff, my coach, my mum. We didn't want everybody going into a panic,\" showcasing a competitive mindset aimed at not giving his rivals an advantage.\n\nHealth and Future Competitions\n\nLyles disclosed that he first felt ill early Tuesday morning, suffering symptoms such as chills and sore throat, and subsequently isolated himself with his team in a hotel. They were proactive in providing him with medication to help maintain his racing condition. \"I still wanted to run; it was still possible,\" he explained. As he recovers, he estimates to be at about \"90 to 95%\" of his physical capability.\n\nThe outcome of the 200 meters final interrupted Lyles' ambition for four gold medals in total, having initially aimed to add the 4x400m relay to his achievements from the previous year. His participation in the upcoming relay events remains uncertain, despite the 4x100m final scheduled for Friday, and the 4x400m final set for Saturday.\n\n\"We haven't decided yet; I'm going to talk to the 4x100m crew,\" Lyles said, emphasizing his commitment to communicate openly with coaches regarding his health status and capabilities.\n\nCurrent Covid-19 Protocols in Sports\n\nUnlike the restrictions faced during the Tokyo Games, when athletes competed under strict coronavirus protocols, the current atmosphere in Paris is significantly more relaxed. Covid-19 is now classified as a respiratory illness, absent of rigorous competition restrictions.\n\nThe USA Track and Field organization promptly implemented the necessary protocols to safeguard the health of Lyles and his teammates, allowing Lyles to compete following a thorough medical assessment. They stressed their commitment to athlete safety while enabling competition.\n\nIn another incident earlier in the Games, British swimmer Adam Peaty also tested positive but returned to competition shortly thereafter.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Following the race, US Track and Field confirmed that the 27-year-old sprinter was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier this week.\n\nRelated: Fans React to U.S. Sprinter Noah Lyles' Medal Finish in Historic Olympics 200m Final", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_audilet@postandcourier.com", "name": "Matt Audilet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He had been open about trying to win gold in both the 200m and 100m races. While the 200m is typically his best event, Lyles wasn't in peak shape while battling COVID.\n\nUSA Track & Field said it was Lyles' choice to compete after he tested positive on Monday.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nNoah Lyles' \"dream goal\" for the Paris Olympics was to break the world record in the 200M, but plans don't always work out how you hope.\n\nFour days after winning the United States' first gold medal in the men's 100m since 2004, Lyles took the track to accomplish a feat last done by Carl Lewis in 1984: winning both the 100m and 200m representing the Stars and Stripes.\n\nLyles entered the Paris track as the overwhelming favorite in, by far, his best event as a three-time world champion (2019, 2022, 2023). However, he was never able to recover from a rough start and had to settle for bronze.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nLyles crossed the line at 19.70, nearly a quarter-second off gold-medal winner Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, and 0.39 seconds off his own personal best.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles needed to be tended to by medical staff. He was seen wearing a mask on Wednesday and before the race on Thursday. NBC then announced that Lyles had tested positive for COVID-19 two days earlier, finding out from his \"distraught\" mother. USA Track and Field confirmed the positive case to the BBC. He is also asthmatic.\n\nNAVY FOOTBALL PLAYER FINDS OUT HIS SISTER WON OLYMPIC GOLD DURING PRACTICE\n\nLyles' reaction time of 0.173 was the slowest of the eight runners in the race. He was tied for the slowest reaction time in the men's 100m, as well, but he still managed to pull off a personal best of 9.79, winning by five-thousandths of a second. Of course, that was before he was sick.\n\nLyles also settled for bronze in Tokyo. American Kenny Bednarek earned his second-straight silver medal in the event.\n\nNonetheless, Lyles doubled his total Olympic medal count with the race - he now has three in total.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDepending on his health, the 27-year-old now figures to turn his attention toward the men's 4x100 meter relay. Lyles did not run in the preliminaries on Thursday morning, likely to conserve any energy for the 200m.\n\nWith the new COVID-19 diagnoses, it remains to be seen whether he will run in the final.

The American sprinter had been diagnosed with COVID-19 two days prior, Lyles told reporters after the race wrapped.\n\nIf Lyles knew he had COVID before the race even started, why was he allowed to compete?\n\nAccording to Scientific American, athletes who test positive for the virus are still allowed to participate in the competition - and several have. As of Wednesday, 19 athletes - many of them British and Australian swimmers - had tested positive.\n\nUnlike the past two Olympics, in Tokyo and Beijing, the Paris Games have no mandatory testing for participating athletes, either, Scientific American reports. Masks are encouraged for those who don't feel well, but they're not required. (Lyles wore a mask when addressing the media after his race, but not in the warm-up or during the event.) There are also single rooms for athletes who are COVID-positive.\n\nWhile there is no overarching COVID policy, some countries have written out their own frameworks for how to tackle the virus at the 2024 Games.\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine. \"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" he added.\n\nAfter Lyles crossed the finish line in third place Thursday, he fell to his back and writhed around in pain, staying down for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting into a wheelchair.\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo took the gold medal in the 200-meter final, while American teammate Kenny Bednarek grabbed silver.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alix_martichoux@wgntv.com", "name": "Alix Martichoux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scientific American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/08/AP24221679137134-e1723145938649.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

He lay on his back on the purple track at Stade de France, after finishing third in a race he had dominated for the last three years, and struggled for breath.\n\nFour days after winning a gold medal in one of the most thrilling endings to an Olympic sprint, Lyles took the bronze in the 200 and considered it, he said afterward, a remarkable achievement. Lyles learned that he had tested positive for the coronavirus around 5 a.m. Paris time on Tuesday, less than 36 hours after he won the 100 in a photo finish that was a stunning start to an Olympic campaign he hoped would position him as the next great American track and field star.\n\nBut on Tuesday, after waking up with chills, aches and a sore throat, symptoms he had experienced during previous exposures, Lyles left the athletes' village to quarantine in a nearby hotel. He said he was taking the antiviral treatment Paxlovid, and that he had not once considered dropping out or revealing his condition in advance of the 200 final. Athletes are not required to test or to report Covid-19 cases.\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete,\" Lyles, wearing an N-95 mask, told reporters about 45 minutes after finishing in 19.70 seconds, behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana (19.46), who won his country's first Olympic gold medal in its history, and the American Kenneth Bednarek (19.62). Lyles added: \"And you never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge?\"\n\nThe Paris Olympics are the first to be held without the pandemic-era bubbles of the Tokyo Games in 2021 and the Beijing Games in 2022. In Tokyo, athletes were tested every four days. In Beijing, they were tested daily. When athletes tested positive, they were placed in quarantine. Most were forced to withdraw from the Games entirely.\n\nNational governing bodies have been tasked with creating their own Covid protocols. Few have specific policies, and many have resorted to something that resembles common sense. A positive test has not stopped athletes from competing.\n\nZac Stubblety-Cook, an Australian swimmer, had Covid when he won silver in the 200 backstroke. The British swimmer Adam Peaty learned he had Covid a day after winning silver in the 100 breaststroke. Lani Pallister, another Australian swimmer, tested positive for Covid and decided to race two days later as part of the 4\u00d7200 relay team, which won gold.\n\nFor Lyles, the first clue that he was not at full strength emerged on Wednesday, when Tebogo raced past him in a semifinal heat; Lyles had won the last two world titles in the 200 -- and had not lost in the event since 2021 -- and so it seemed it was likely that he was lagging on purpose, conserving energy before Thursday's final and the upcoming 4\u00d7100 relays.\n\nWhen Lyles was introduced on Thursday night, he darted out of the tunnel, spinning and shouting and pointing to the crowd. The crowd chanted \"U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\" until they were shushed over the arena loudspeakers.\n\nAt the gun, Lyles got off the blocks slower than the seven other finalists. But unlike Sunday, when he trailed for the first 90 meters before edging Kishane Thompson of Jamaica at the end, Lyles lacked endurance and speed, particularly around the bend.\n\nAfterward, Lyles sat near the track, breathing heavily. He got up slowly and called for water, after which medical officials led him to a seat and spoke to him.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team U.S.A. athletes while upholding their right to compete,\" U.S.A. Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, said in a statement on Thursday night. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles entered these Olympics eager to reassert his primacy after floundering at the Tokyo Games, where he finished with a bronze medal in the 200 and opened up about his struggles with his mental health. He called his medal \"boring\" as he spoke through tears to reporters, the only people who were in the stadium.\n\nLyles, 27, thinks of racing as performance art. He loves to race and win, but he loves to race and win in front of a full stadium even more -- the bigger and louder and feistier the crowd, the better.\n\nHe has ripped his speedsuit in triumph after winning world championships, presented anime cards to the camera before and after races, and has become a ubiquitous figure on his Peacock series, YouTube channel and the Netflix docuseries \"Sprint.\"\n\nAt the 2023 world championships in Budapest, he turned in the performance he had long said he was capable of, winning the 100, 200 and the 4\u00d7100 meter relay. He had been eager to go for that trifecta in Paris, too, and perhaps add a gold medal in the 4\u00d7400 to it.\n\nInstead, the rest of Lyles's program is in doubt. He did not win the sprint double, like Usain Bolt or Carl Lewis or Jesse Owens, and it wasn't clear on Thursday whether he would run in any relays.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news",

The 100-meter final was only the first step.\n\nLyles wants to win the 200-meter gold medal Thursday and win a gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay Friday to put his name alongside some of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time. Only Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Carl Lewis (1984) and Usain Bolt (2012 and 2016) have ever won gold medals in all three of those sprint events at the same Olympics.\n\nNext up on Lyles' list: His signature event.\n\nThe Alexandria, Virginia native is the defending world champion in the 200 meters, but finished second in the 200-meter semifinals on Wednesday -- his first loss since earning a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. He finished with a time of 20.08 seconds.\n\nLyles cruised through his heat Tuesday in 19.31 seconds, two days after he ran the fastest Olympic 100-meter race since Usain Bolt set the Olympic record with a 9.63 in 2012. His time in the 200 on Tuesday was the fastest recorded at the Olympics since Bolt set an Olympic record at the Beijing Games in 2008.\n\nMUST READ: American sprinter Noah Lyles is no longer a meme. He's a stunning redemption story.\n\nLyles also voiced the desire ahead of this week to attempt an unprecedented run at four medals in Paris. He wanted to be included on the United States 4x400 relay team, and the manner in which he publicly campaigned for a spot in the race drew criticism on social media from Quincy Hall, who won the 400-meter gold medal on Wednesday.\n\nLyles ran on Team USA's silver-medal winning 4x400-relay team at the 2024 world indoor track and field championships, but he's not expected to be included at the Olympics.\n\nHe is expected, however, to be a part of the American 4x100-relay team. Lyles anchored the 4x100 team that won a gold medal at the World Athletics Relays in May along with Kenny Bednarek, Courtney Lindsay and Kyree King.\n\nIf all goes as he plans, Lyles will cross the finish line as an Olympic legend.\n\nHere's a look at the company Lyles looks to keep if he can make history at the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nAthletes who won 100m, 200m and 4x100 relay in single

He is also the first African man to win the 200m final, an event typically dominated by American and Caribbean sprinters.\n\nAs Lyles mentioned, Tebogo has had to deal with a lot in the last year, including the death of his mother in May. He wore spikes for the race with her birthday on the side of the shoe.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field,\" Tebogo said about having his mother's birthday on his spikes.\n\n\"To take her [with me], it gives me a lot of motivation. She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy.\"\n\nLyles' Olympics could be over, depending on his availability for the relay races. He indicated that he could choose to bow out of those races, giving other Americans the chance to win gold as he continues to recover from COVID.\n\nLyles will leave with at least two medals and the title of fastest man alive, but he's certainly disappointed after a third-place finish in his signature event on the track.\n\nRelated: Everyone Has The Same Reaction To Noah Lyles' Illness Announcement", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kameron_duncan@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kameron Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Lyles finished third in 19.70, and received a code of conduct warning.

He's previously earned a silver medal in the 100-meter and bronze in the 200-meter at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nLyles was feeling confident after his 100-meter win on Sunday.\n\n\"To be honest, I just believed in myself,\" Lyles told reporters, including PEOPLE, of how he was able to recover from a slower start to win gold. \"That goes to prove that reaction time does not win races.\"\n\nThe Adidas star added to reporters that he knew \"every step of the way it was not 2021,\" referring to his disappointing finish at the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"I'm still constantly moving forward, moving forward, moving forward, and I knew that when the time came, for me to be able to say, 'This is the final, this is where I need to put it together,' I was gonna do it,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2023", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2023"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/JSNMr5PbZW0jfqyBCrTY8DZ0UZY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1753x0:1755x2)/GettyImages-2165362156-4dc7a10fe3db431f8605e00bc40d8c39.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 738, "textEnd": 744}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Hometown, high school and more to know about Virginia roots", "body": "The world has a new fastest man, and he comes from the United States.\n\nNoah Lyles' victory in the 100-meter final by the smallest of margins in Paris propelled him into the international spotlight and made him the USA's first Olympic winner of the event in two decades.\n\nFor Lyles, the win was what he had been expecting all along. Even as he posted a pair of second-place finishes in the preliminary rounds of the 100-meter, Lyles kept his confidence high and insisted he wouldn't be beaten when the lights shined the brightest. He started out behind the rest of the pack in the final, but in the end, it was the Star-Spangled Banner that played when the medal ceremony took place.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Lyles' upbringing in the U.S., including his birthplace and high school.\n\nMORE NOAH LYLES: Photo finish explainer | Last US man to win 100m gold | Best photos\n\nLyles was born in Gainesville, Fla., but he was raised in Alexandria, Va. after he and his siblings moved to Virginia following their parents' divorce.\n\nAlexandria is just south of Washington D.C. and has close ties to the colonial era, as it was founded in 1749.\n\nThe north Virginia region was proud of Lyles after his 100-meter win, with his uncle watching the race at an Alexandria restaurant. Another area restaurant actually added a burger in Lyles' name to its menu to celebrate the gold medal.\n\nThe Washington D.C. area can claim more Olympic medals than the vast majority of countries from these Summer Games. Not only is Lyles from the region, but swimmer Torri Huske is from neighboring Arlington, Va. and the legendary Katie Ledecky grew up in Bethesda, Md.\n\nHuske and Ledecky combined for nine swimming medals in Paris, while Lyles has one medal and is expecting a second in the 200-meter. Lyles figures to get a hero's welcome when he returns from Paris, regardless of how the 200-meter final turns out.\n\nLyles attended Alexandria City High School, which was known as T.C. Williams High School at the time.\n\nIf the T.C. Williams name sounds familiar, it's because the famous football film \"Remember The Titans\" is based on the true story of the school's 1971 football team.\n\nLyles first took steps toward stardom during his time in high school, winning a medal at the World Youth Championships when he was just 15 and the Youth Olympic Games when he was 17.\n\nMORE: Who is Noah Lyles dating?\n\nLyles did not go to college, but he interestingly would have gone back to Gainesville if he followed through with a college career. Lyles committed to the University of Florida, setting up a potential homecoming, but he instead turned professional in 2016.\n\nThat commitment paid off, as Lyles first won gold at the World Championships in 2019, winning the 200-meter, and he earned a trip to Tokyo for the Summer Olympics ahead of the delayed 2020 games. Lyles would win bronze in the 200-meter in Tokyo.\n\nLyles only grew more confident in the three years between Tokyo and Paris, and he validated every bit of that confidence by winning the 100-meter final on Sunday. The 200-meter is believed to be an even easier path to gold for Lyles, though he knows now not to underestimate the competition.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath.

Even in 2022 at the Winter Games, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4x100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris.

It remains to be seen if Lyles will be fit enough to participate.\n\n'Personally, I wouldn't say we were at risk because it's not a contact sport,' Tebogo said when asked about Lyles' controversial decision to run in the 200m final.\n\n'So even during the warm-ups and in the call room, he was just there by himself.\n\n'Personally, I wondered why [he was by himself].

I take care of my body so when it comes to getting sick, that's rare for me,' Bednarek said.\n\n'When I found out, it wasn't that big of a deal. He went out there, did his best while being sick.\n\n'I hope he gets better, that's all I can really say.'\n\nSpeaking to NBC shortly after the final, Lyles hinted that he was angling towards pulling out of the 4x100m relay in two days' time.\n\n'At the minute I don't know but I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their own thing,' he said.\n\n'They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me and if that is the case coming off today then I'm perfectly fine to let them go do their thing.\n\n'They have more than enough speed to handle it and get the gold medal.'\n\nMORE : Javelin judge's priceless reaction to Arshad Nadeem's enormous Olympic record throw\n\nMORE : American sprinter accuses Olympic organisers of 'favouritism' ahead of 200m final", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Logan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Logan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshad_Nadeem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshad Nadeem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/comp-1723155275.png?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Botswana's Letsile Tebogo won the gold with a time of 19.46 seconds and the USA's Kenneth Bednarek won the silver finishing with a time of 19.62 seconds.\n\nThe 200m is Lyles' premiere, preferred event and he's ranked number one in the world for it. Lyles needed medical attention after the race, but it wasn't clear what was the issue.\n\nLyles had a thrilling triumph in the 100m final on Sunday. The 27-year-old turned on the jets late to win the race by a fraction of a second, capturing his first Olympic gold medal and Team USA's first 100m title in two decades.\n\nLyles is still expected to compete in the men' 4x100m relay final on Friday.\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times. Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- will it be in the 200m final?\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved a combined 11 times by nine athletes in the history of the Olympics.\n\nOlympic legend Usain Bolt was the last man to complete the sprint double -- and he achieved the feat at three straight Games.\n\nThe eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, 2012 London Games and 2016 Rio Games, becoming the only man to record an Olympic sprint double multiple times.

Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals in Paris.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal time overall behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nLyles already competed in the men's 100m and will be competing in the 4x100m relay as well. Here's what the schedule for that event looks like:\n\nAll of Noah Lyles' medal races will be broadcast live on Peacock and NBCOlympics.com.\n\nLyles' races will also be shown either live or on replay in primetime on NBC.\n\nNow Lyles currently has three Olympic medals: gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m at the Paris Olympics, and bronze in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics.", "source": {"uri":

He sat on the side of the track for an extended period of time as medical personnel attended to him. Photographs and video from after the event showed him being taken off the track in a wheelchair.\n\nHe said in the interview, \"It's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal.\"\n\nHe said he quarantined as much as possible but never considered skipping the race.\n\nUSA Track & Field said in a statement: \"We can confirm that Noah Lyles tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, August 6th. In response, the USOPC [U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee] and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\"\n\nIt continued, \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles is scheduled for one more race, the 4x100-meters relay, but he told NBC after the 200 meters he wasn't sure if he would compete in that event.\n\n\"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty they can handle it without me,\" he said. \"If that's the case coming off today, I'm perfectly fine saying, 'Hey, you guys do your thing. You have more than enough speed to handle it and get the gold medal.'\"\n\nOn Sunday, Lyles narrowly edged Kishane Thompson to capture the 100-meter gold, besting the Jamaican by a mere five thousandths of a second.

He participated in the 200-meter semifinal on Wednesday, where he finished second. Lyles' coach afterward said the sprinter was \"fine.\"\n\nLyles, who usually always takes an opportunity to talk, did not speak to reporters after the semifinal.\n\nThe 100-meter champion said he was feeling better as the 200 final approached. He estimated he was about 90-95 percent when the starting gun went off.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said after Thursday night's race. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, dons a face mask following his men's 200-meters final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek)\n\nLyles was trailing 200-meter champion Botswana\u00b4s Letsile Tebogo as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where the American puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of his race. Before this week, he hadn\u00b4t lost a 200 since his third-place finish in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nThis time, Lyles could not close. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn\u00b4t have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThree years ago, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic participants. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic. COVID rules have been changed in much of society, including sports, school and work. The USATF says they followed current policies.\n\nLyles was expected to run the anchor leg of the 4x100 on Friday in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his relay teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I\u00b4m going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nNoah Lyles, of the United States, is treated by medical staff following the men's 200-meters final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.

The Botswana prodigy was also the only one to run a sub-20 in the heat.\n\nThis event, however, split the track world because, while some regarded Tebogo as the favorite to win the gold medal, others were aware that Lyles did not reveal his full pace before the finals.\n\nThe 200-meter sprint, like the 100-meter sprints, had participants struggling against a 0.2 headwind, yet the Botswana Sprinter still managed to run at an excellent pace.\n\nLyles (20.08) finished just 0.12 seconds behind him, which was a significant margin in track and field. Makanakaishe Charamba of Zimbabwe finished third, clocking a time of 20.31.\n\nEven though Noah Lyles is at the top of the world lead rankings in the 200 meters, this fan was surprised by the American's pace in the race.\n\nWhile many fans were impressed with Tebogo, one track enthusiast pointed out how the American employed a certain strategy at the finish of the race.\n\nLyles' 20.08 placed him second, but it also helped him obtain a good position on the grid in the finals.\n\nAfter the race at the Stade de France, this fan noticed the six-time world champion's expression.\n\nThe top eight participants from the semifinals will compete in the 200-meter final. They have all worked hard to reach the pinnacle of track and field, and the Stade de France will offer them the opportunity to shine and grab Olympic medals, depending on their running abilities.\n\nThe event will begin on August 8 at 2:30 p.m. ET, and American fans are eager to see Noah Lyles chase his second Olympic gold medal after winning the 100-meter Olympic title.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/cc5cac5a-noah-lyle-and-letsile-tebogo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1788, "textEnd": 1796}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles finishes third in Olympics 200m final as Botswana's Letsile Tebogo shocks the world to take gold\n\nNoah Lyles was fresh out of winning the Olympic Gold of the 100m dash final, he was finally about to fulfill his destiny and his dream. In fact, he always claimed that the 200m dash was his favorite to compete. But as it turns out, Noah Lyles came back positive for Covid-19 and this sparked significant controversy because of it. He did race but Noah was nowhere near the gold medal or from the level of performance we know from him. The one who took the gold from him is Batswana's Letslie Tebogo after finishing the race in 19.46 seconds. Noah Lyles was very happy before the race and had to receive medical assistance right after it. Due to the flamboyant way in which he entered the final, Noah Lyles is being questioned about his Covid diagnosis.\n\nRight after the final, it was announced that Lyles has Covid and many of the athletes beside him have complained about it. Racing like that and putting everybody at risk of being infected should result in a considerable punishment for Lyles. Fans were also deeply unhappy with lyles for still making the decision to race despite testing positive for Covid before the race. But more important than how this made everybody feel was teh reaction from the rest of the world for lyles' irresponsible behavior. What did the athlete do? He decided to take the high road and not even mention the issues he has caused with his decision to compete despite having Covid.\n\nNoah took to instagram to make the announcement he is bowing out of the Olympics with the 100m gold and the 200m bronze. He still had the team competition to perform but he will not be doing that. Here's what he wrote: \"First I want to thank God for getting me through this entire Olympics! Second I want to congratulate Lestlie Tebogo, Kenny Bednarek and everyone else on an amazing Olympic 200m final. Finally I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages. I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show.

Tebogo, 21, became the youngest man to win gold in the 200 meters since the United States' Bobby Morrow in 1956 and the first man from an African nation to do so in Olympic history.\n\nAll eyes entering the event were on United States sprinting sensation Noah Lyles, who won the 100 meters on Sunday and had an eye on setting a world record in the 200 meters. He was looking to become the first American to pull off the 100-200 double since Carl Lewis in 1984.\n\nInstead, Lyles, who battles asthma and wore a mask backstage before being introduced, looked gassed and needed medical assistance the race. He never came near the lead before ultimately finishing third in 19.70 seconds for a bronze medal\n\nIt was revealed after the race on NBC that Lyles was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday. He received medical assistance shortly after crossing the finish line and again behind the scenes. The IOC decided to drop previous COVID-19 protocols ahead of the Paris Olympics with the disease instead treated like other respiratory illnesses; athletes and teams were allowed to determine their ability to compete.\n\nLyles' personal best in the 200 meters is 19.31 seconds, an American record set at the 2022 World Championships. His season best was 19.53 seconds set at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June, and it stands to reason he would have been more competitive toward gold had he not been dealing with the illness.\n\nBetween the duo was fellow American Kenny Bednarek, who won a silver medal in 19.62 seconds. Bednarek and Lyles similarly finished in silver and bronze positions at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nPulling off the 100-200 double is extremely difficult as only 10 men have achieved the feat in history. Jamaica's Usain Bolt (2008, 2012, 2016) is the last man to win gold medals in both events during the same Olympic Games. Prior to Bolt came Lewis at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nCBS Sports will update this developing story shortly.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_silverstein@cbssports.com", "name": "Adam Silverstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Morrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Morrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern pentathlon at the 1984 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/08/6c0a8bf6-5641-4853-a0ec-d1600f2ec5be/thumbnail/1200x675/0fe9c9e2a78a82df9ab721628bf70671/noah-lyles-gassed-200m-olymipcs-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and a year delay before the Games led to depression that he said hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nTebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history. Bednarek, who also won silver in Tokyo, finished in 19.62 and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nMORE: Russian disinformation campaign out to undermine Paris Olympics\n\nMORE: Simone Biles finishes off her return to the Olympics with a silver on floor exercise\n\nMORE: Paris Olympics controversy speaks to anti-LGBTQ+ athletics policies in York County\n\nIn the semifinal, Lyles finished second and skipped his traditional meeting with reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nThis time, Tebogo was leading as the sprinters reached the curve. That's the time Lyles usually puts on his trademark close, but there was no strong finish.", "source": {"uri": "yorkdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "York Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@yorkdispatch.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lithium-ion battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/08/PPYD/74725160007-ap-24221672764686.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1022,575,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

What to know about USA sprinter's status after positive COVID test", "body": "Noah Lyles' search for double gold in this year's Olympics came to a swift end on Thursday when the American sprint star -- felled by COVID-19 -- suffered a third-place finish at his signature event, the 200m.\n\nLyles appeared worse for the wear once he sprinted through the finish line, ripping his jersey off and immediately seeking water and medical assistance for his ailment. He was escorted off the track in a wheelchair before appearing on NBC in which he confirmed that he was diagnosed with COVID-19 two days ago.\n\nLyles was far from his best on Thursday, posting a 19.70s finish in the competition, 0.24 seconds slower than that of gold medalist Leslie Tebogo. Entering this year's Games, he appeared likely to take part in three events, not two, with Lyles expected to join the likes of Kenny Bednarek, Christian Coleman, and Fred Kerley on the U.S.'s 4x100m relay team.\n\nLIVE OLYMPICS MEDAL COUNT:\n\nOverall table | Who is winning the Olympics? | Who's won the most gold?\n\nThose plans now appear up in the air. Here's what you need to know about Lyles' COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the implications it could have on his participation in the 4x100m relay Friday night.\n\nMORE: Noah Lyles ran 200-meter dash with COVID, leaves track in wheelchair\n\nIt's anyone's guess whether Lyles will participate in the men's 4x100m relay on Friday. He said as much during his post-race interview with NBC's Lewis Johnson.\n\n\"At the moment, I don't know,\" Lyles said. \"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me. And if that's the case coming off today, then I'm perfectly fine saying 'Hey, you guys go do your thing. You guys have more than enough speed to be able to handle it and get the gold medal.\"\n\nAt present, it seems as if Lyles is leaning toward not taking part in the 4x100m relay. That's an understandable choice given the amount of pain he appeared to be displaying when the 200m final concluded.\n\nLyles has been open about his experiences with asthma throughout life, outlining his first memories with the condition during a 2020 interview with CNN.\n\n\"So, about 3 to 4, all the way to about 7 years old, I was dealing with asthma and asthma attacks seriously, like in the hospital, maybe every third night; coughing fits, constantly sick because my immune system was weak,\" Lyles said.\n\nMORE: Meet 21-year-old Botswana sprinter who upset USA's Noah Lyles\n\nHe appears to have found a way to manage the chronic illness, claiming four individual world titles to go along with his Olympic medals over the course of his glittering career. Nevertheless, you're never quite sure how COVID-19 will impact one's respiratory system, particularly when the person in question already deals with a respiratory illness.\n\nUSA Track and Field gave Lyles the responsibility of deciding whether he was to compete or not in the 200m. If that decision is any precedent, then it's likely Lyles will then be asked whether he feels capable of participating in the 4x100m. If not, he'll see his spot on the team filled by one of Courtney Lindsey or Kyree King. He wouldn't receive a medal if the U.S. were to finish in the top-three places in that case, as he wouldn't have taken part in either prelims (which took place earlier on Thursday) or finals.\n\nThe U.S. team -- which Bednarek is also expected to join on Friday -- posted a scorching 37.47s time to win the first heat of Thursday's 4x100m relay prelims. The Americans quartet featured Coleman, Lindsey, Kerley. and King.\n\nThe U.S. hasn't won a gold medal in the event since the 2000 Sydney Games.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyree_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyree King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/olympic-mens-200m-odds-predictions-noay-lyles.jpg?itok=Rbxg9tNU", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Nonetheless, he bounced out of the tunnel and ran along waving to the crowds as the rest of the field patiently waited at their starting blocks.\n\nFamously a finisher, Lyles got an uncharacteristically sharp start out of the blocks. The close to his race was also to be uncharacteristic.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo would take a decisive victory for his country's first-ever Olympic medal (and gold at that), while Lyles faded in the final 50 metres to hand silver to his US teammate Kenneth Bednarek.\n\nHowever, surreal scenes were to develop seconds after the race concluded, as the nature of Lyles' reported \"injury\" problems came to light.\n\nREAD HERE: The Rise And Rise Of Kellie Harrington, One Of Ireland's Greatest Boxers\n\nREAD HERE: Mexican Athlete Lodged Complaint After Scoring Zero For Awful Dive At The

triple-Olympic-medallist struggling to get back on his feet after a gruelling race.\n\nFootage would then emerge of Lyles pre-race, with his face covered by a mask.\n\nMultiple media outlets would share confirmation from US Track and Field that the American sprinter had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nLyles was allegedly diagnosed with COVID two days ago, but decided he would attempt the 200m nonetheless.\n\nIn an utterly bizarre image, the 100m champion was wheeled away from the track in a wheelchair as he continued to struggle post-race.\n\nThough we were expecting drama in the 200m final, this was certainly not how we foresaw it playing out.\n\nIt is unclear whether Noah Lyles will recover in time to take any part in the 4x100m relay later this week, an event in which he and the

Please try again later.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles, energy personified, collapsed on the track after his double-gold quest ended. He stayed on his back for a disturbing while. He rolled over on his left side. He struggled into a sitting position. As he gasped for air, the man seemingly with caffeine in his veins -- the one who claimed the crown as world's fastest by a whisker-thin margin Sunday -- moved like a snail wearing a weighted vest.\n\nLyles hunched over on his left knee, braced himself with his left hand and lowered his head. He rose eventually and tried to shuffle out of sight. He had finished third in the men's 200 meters Thursday at Stade de France, but there was no way he could take the U.S. flag and parade around the track. There was also no way he could be disappointed about falling short of becoming the 10th man in Olympic history to accomplish the 100-200 double. His only reaction was to ask for help. He gestured for water and fell to the track again as soon as he received it. He needed a wheelchair to exit.\n\nSoon after, we learned why he wore a mask before his signature race, why he seemed mortal during it and why he looked completely depleted afterward: Lyles had covid-19. To reporters, he recalled waking up early Tuesday morning with a sore throat, chills and an aching body. He took a test, and at 5 a.m., he knew the results. Still, he wanted to compete.\n\n\"It's one and done,\" Lyles said. \"There's no holding back.\"\n\nWe thought covid was over. In a sense, the Paris Olympics have been a celebration of global vitality, with athletes and fans living their best lives, shedding the dystopian restrictions that stifled the past two Games staged amid the pandemic. Before competition began, Olympic committees from many nations detailed their covid policies with a shrug. That's all you needed to know.\n\nAnna Meares, the Australia chef de mission, was the most direct. \"I want to stress that we treat covid the same way we treat other viruses like the flu,\" she said. \"This is not Tokyo.\"\n\nBut Thursday felt like those delayed 2021 Tokyo Olympics. It felt all kinds of wrong. The misfortune cost Lyles a better chance at history, though it should be noted that the 19.46 seconds that gold medalist Letsile Tebogo ran to win meant Lyles would've needed to go faster than he has this year.\n\nStill, it was more irksome than just Lyles's legacy bid. Covid may not be regarded as the scary virus that it was four years ago, but for the most part, we have failed to sufficiently confront the proper way to move about the world while ill. Quarantine thresholds have been lowered almost to being personal decisions. In sports, testing is not mandatory. We just witnessed a world-class athlete run the 200 meters in 19.70 seconds with the coronavirus. That's quite a feat -- and a conundrum.\n\n\"I was coughing through the night,\" Lyles said. \"I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with covid.\"\n\nBut what if he infected other competitors? He hugged U.S. teammate, Kenny Bednarek, immediately after the race. He wore a mask as the field gathered in tight quarters inside before walking onto the track. There are still two more days track remaining and plenty of medals to be decided. Who else has Lyles been around?\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Bednarek, who won the silver with a time of 19.62 seconds. \"I mean, if I get sick or whatever, like, I'll be fine. If he gets sick ... I don't view those things as a big deal.\"\n\nSaid Tebogo, a 21-year-old from Botswana: \"I don't know he put anyone at risk.\"\n\nThey're too tough to care. They're also Olympians, which means they have one shot every four years. They're not going to blame Lyles for doing something they would've done. And if they get sick and still feel like they can compete, they will.\n\nBeing gritty has never been so icky.\n\nWelcome officially to the post-pandemic sports era, where covid continues to slither about but athletes are back to blind perseverance. Lyles won't be the last to admit he plowed through an event. Toughing it out is back. It was inevitable, but it's still uncomfortable.\n\nCovid impacted a race that was hyped as Lyles's chance to become a transcendent talent. He already was the mouth of the Games, and by 0.005 seconds in Sunday's 100 meters, he backed up his bravado. Now, he aspired to be the face of the Games.\n\nWinning the 100 and 200 meters in the same Olympics turns a fast man into a track deity. Lyles hoped to join a list that includes Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt. The 27-year-old, who went to high school in Alexandria, Va., kept his positive test quiet, but he left the Olympic Village and quarantined in a hotel Tuesday. He took \"as much medication as we legally could to make sure my body could keep the momentum going.\"\n\nHe made it through the qualification heats, and when it was time for the 200 final, he tried to shine under the bright stadium lights. He came out with his usual showmanship, skipping, hopping, yelling and spreading his arms wide. The world's fastest man was in the building. He slapped his starting block before getting set.\n\n\"I knew that if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I have from the get-go,\" Lyles said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy. That was the strategy.\"\n\nSo this is what it's like to compete with that insidious virus: Lyles could be only covid's fastest man.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nGet the latest updates on the 2024 Olympics\n\n(Washington Post illustration)\n\nTrack all the Paris Olympic medal counts country by country, and see the breakdown of medals by U.S. athletes.

Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while, I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nHe spoke wearing a thick black mask. On a night that could have transformed Lyles into a legend, he instead became a throwback to a time we've quickly forgotten.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Probably already have, with far less at stake.\n\nLyles raced the 200 meters Thursday night after being diagnosed with COVID early Tuesday morning. In other words, he went to work sick. Just as countless Americans do every day. Because they can't take time off work. Because they don't want to get behind. Because they don't really feel that bad. Because, because, because.\n\nIn Lyles' case, he had a gold medal to win and history to chase.\n\nHaving already won the 100 meters earlier this week, Lyles wanted to join Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt in that exclusive club of sprinters who won gold in both the 100 and 200 in the same Olympics. The goal has fueled him these last several years, and winning the double at last year's world championships let him know it was within reach.\n\nAnd then he got sick.\n\nLyles said he woke up in the middle of the night Monday with chills, a sore throat and his body aching. He recognized the symptoms, having had COVID before, and a test early Tuesday confirmed he had it. He moved into a hotel so he wouldn't expose others and began taking Paxlovid, an antiviral medication that accelerates recovery.\n\nThe idea of not racing never crossed his mind, even if he didn't have his usual speed. Lyles won the bronze medal, finishing a distant third behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and fellow American Kenny Bednarek.\n\n\"No, no, no. I was going to compete regardless,\" Lyles said. \"If I didn't make it to the finals, that would've been the sign not to compete.\"\n\nHad this been the Tokyo Olympics, or the Beijing Winter Games, that choice wouldn't have been Lyles' to make. Athletes were required to be vaccinated ahead of both those Games and undergo regular testing. If they tested positive, they were sent to quarantine, Olympic dreams be damned.\n\nBut enough people have either been vaccinated or had COVID, or both, that it's no longer the terrifying threat it once was. People aren't dying by the millions and hospitals aren't being overrun. Thanks to science, and enough people believing in it, we've tamed a devastating pandemic to the point it can now be treated like many other respiratory illnesses.\n\nThere were no vaccination requirements for these Games, either from the International Olympic Committee or U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. No testing of any kind, either.\n\nThe USOPC says it is following the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control, which now says someone with COVID can resume normal activities if their symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours. Lyles says they have been, calling himself \"90 to 95%\"\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the USOPC and USA Track and Field said in a statement. \"We respect his decision and will condition to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles is an asthmatic, which means COVID can be a bigger threat to him than other people. But he's vaccinated. He took precautions to protect others, including wearing a mask before and after his race.\n\nHe's also a grown man who, at 27, can decide for himself whether he should race or not.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" Lyles said. \"But to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything - coming out and getting a bronze medal with COVID, three days ago.\"\n\nLyles is hardly the first to decide being so close to accomplishing a lifelong dream -- whether that's standing atop a medals podium or simply being able to say they competed at the Olympics -- outweighs any health risk.\n\nKerri Strug vaulted on an ankle that was severely sprained and had two torn tendons, and has defended her decision repeatedly. Emil Zatopek won the 5,000-meter, 10,000-meter and marathon golds at the 1952 Olympics after defying his doctor's orders not to compete because of a gland infection. The marathon winner at the 1904 Olympics nearly died because of the extreme heat.\n\nBut ordinary people make similar calculations every day. Sometimes we stay in bed, loading up on chicken soup, orange juice and bad TV until whatever bug we have passes.\n\nSometimes we don't have that luxury, though, and we haul ourselves out of bed and into work or whatever else we have to do. That's what Lyles did.\n\nSometimes Olympians really are like the rest of us.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

It is Lyles' event, the one in which he made his name, the one in which he has won three straight world titles.\n\nThe one in which the talk pre-Paris was not about whether or not he would win gold, but whether Usain Bolt's world record could go. The complexion, though, has changed a little, after Lyles finished only second in his semi-final, 0.12seconds behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, who qualified fastest for the final.\n\nOn the one hand, there might be little cause for panic: remember, Lyles did not win either his heat or his semi-final en route to gold in the 100m, consoling himself with the idea that others were expending more than was wise when afforded their one shot at the king.\n\nOn the other, this was the first time he had been beaten over half-a-lap since finishing third in the Olympic final in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nLyles did not speak to the media afterwards, instead reported by LetsRun.com to have gone \"straight to medical\", a vague enough phrase to set the rumour mill to work.\n\nWas this the 27-year-old conserving energy in his fifth race in as many days, or is something physically amiss?\n\nEither way, the uncertainty has added a layer of intrigue to the final that would not have been there had Lyles blown the field away while easing down.\n\nTebogo is one threat, but, if Lyles is short of his best, then virtually the entire field is in play, all but one of the eight finalists having broken the 20sec barrier this season.\n\nThe quickest of them is fellow American Kenny Bednarek, who finished just 0.06sec behind Lyles when setting his personal best of 19.59 at the US Olympic trials this year.\n\nBednarek cruised to victory in his semi-final and then was immediately involved in controversy, taking to X, formerly Twitter, to express his fury at his lane allocation for the final.\n\nDespite winning his semi and qualifying second-fastest in a time of 20.00sec, the 25-year-old was initially assigned lane four -- tighter than ideal in the 200m -- while Lyles had the more preferable lane five.\n\n\"Never seen favoritism like this on a global scale,\" Bednarek posted.\n\nAfter a protest, he has been switched to lane eight, with Lyles unmoved in five.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/2d081953db0811d5b6c20d5609bf2f98", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

He ran a 20.08, finishing behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, who ran a 19.96.\n\nWhile it was just a semifinal race, some fans are concerned by Lyles' showing, especially considering what he was wearing before the event. Lyles was spotted in a mask before the gun went off, leading some to wonder if he's dealing with a sickness.\n\nLyles, who is from Alexandria, Virginia, didn't appear to have a mask on before his 100m final on Sunday.\n\nMany fans of the Summer Olympics are now wondering if Lyles is dealing with an illness that could hamper him in the final of the race on Thursday.\n\n\"Noah Lyles in the back with a face mask. Wonder if he is sick and if so how that might impact him in the finals,\" one fan wrote.\n\n\"i hope Lyles isnt sick. was wearing a mask backstage, then only got 2nd in the semi, which doesnt matter but he never loses even in heats or semis,\" one fan added.\n\n\"Noah Lyles had on a mask before the 200m. I don't think he had a mask on before the 100m... oh boy. The certainly should have had better COVID precautions. Masks should have been mandatory,\" one fan added.\n\nThe 200m is arguably Lyles' best event. He's typically somewhat of a slow starter, which can hurt him in the 100m, but isn't as big of a deal in the 200m. If he doesn't come away with gold on Thursday, maybe he is dealing with something.\n\nThe final of the men's 200m dash will air live on NBC on Thursday at 2:30 p.m. E.T.\n\nRelated: U.S. Track Star Noah Lyles Is Dating A Fellow Olympian\n\nRelated: Noah Lyles Admits He Had Brutal First Date With His Olympian Girlfriend", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_holleran@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Holleran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Bolt in 2012 also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to ever complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently became the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, doing so in the 2016 Games and pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Thompson-Herah had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in the history of the Games, with Carl Lewis' 1984 feat standing as the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow and Lewis, along with Bolt in both 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nThe 200m is considered to be Lyles' stronger race compared to the 100m. After earning bronze at the Tokyo Games, Lyles didn't lose a single 200m race until Wednesday's semifinals at the Paris Games.\n\nLyles placed second in his semifinal heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00).\n\nBednarek is the event's reigning Olympic silver medalist. The defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, failed to qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is also the American record of 19.31 seconds, which he tallied at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nUsain Bolt set the 200m world record with a time of 19.19 seconds at the 2009 World Championships. But Lyles has said he believes he'll eventually break Bolt's record mark -- could it be in the 200m final?\n\nLyles will look to become just the 10th man to ever pull off the Olympic sprint double when he races in the 200m final on Thursday, Aug. 8 at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe men's 200m final will be shown on NBC and Peacock. It will also be available to stream here:\n\nLyles enters the 200m final with two Olympic medals: a 200m bronze from the Tokyo Games and a 100m gold from the Paris Games.\n\nHe's also a three-time world champion in the 200m and the reigning world champion in the 100m.\n\nFollowing the 200m final, Lyles is scheduled to next move over to the men's 4x100m relay. The relay event begins with the first round on Thursday followed by the final on Friday.\n\nSo there's a chance Lyles will enter the weekend with an Olympic sprint triple under his belt.", "source":

Lyles learned that he had tested positive for the coronavirus around 5 a.m. Paris time on Tuesday, less than 36 hours after he won the 100 in a photo finish that was a stunning start to an Olympic campaign he hoped would position him as the next great American track and field star.\n\nBut on Tuesday, after waking up with chills, aches and a sore throat, symptoms he had experienced during previous exposures, Lyles left the athletes' village to quarantine in a nearby hotel. He said he was taking the antiviral treatment Paxlovid, and that he had not once considered dropping out or revealing his condition in advance of the 200 final. Athletes are not required to test or to report Covid-19 cases.\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete,\" Lyles, wearing an N-95 mask, told reporters about 45 minutes after finishing in 19.70 seconds, behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana (19.46), who won his country's first Olympic gold medal in its history, and the American Kenneth Bednarek (19.62).

The athlete cruised to the gold medal with a time of 19.46, outpacing Team USA's Kenny Bednarek (silver) and Noah Lyles (bronze), who was notably battling a case of COVID-19.\n\nAfter the event, Tebogo took questions from the media. He was appropriately asked if he had any ambitions about being one of the faces of sprinting worldwide. In a very matter-of-fact fashion -- I'm talking with a completely straight face -- Tebogo said he probably couldn't be one of the faces because he's not as \"loud or arrogant\" as Lyles.\n\nIt's not surprising that Tebogo would say something like this. Lyles' general brashness probably hasn't exactly endeared him to his fellow competitors. Lyles' well-publicized beef with NBA superstars might just be the tip of the iceberg there.\n\nIt is worth noting that Lyles did congratulate Tebogo after the race:\n\nKudos to Tebogo for saying something like this after actually beating Lyles, though. That man is almost certainly on top of the world for beating one of his top rivals. He's earned the right to pontificate as he pleases.\n\nAnd the irony of it?

Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy.' That's all I could have wished for. I'm happy I finished the race healthier than before.\"\n\nHis time was a PB by 0.04, improving his own African record set in London last year.\n\nFour days on from his 100m victory in Paris, Lyles wasn't able to immediately celebrate his second medal as he was helped off the track in a wheelchair. USATF later confirmed that Lyles had tested positive for Covid on Tuesday but still wanted to compete.\n\nSix-time world champion Lyles had started Paris 2024 with a 200m win streak that dated back to the Tokyo Olympic Games. But after the 27-year-old won his heat, Tebogo handed him his first defeat after 26 consecutive victories, beating him in the semifinals.\n\nHe repeated the feat in the final, becoming the first African man to win the Olympic 200m title and claiming his nation's third ever Olympic medal, a maiden gold.\n\nTebogo, who finished sixth in the 100m final, adds his Olympic gold to the two world medals - 100m silver and 200m bronze - he claimed in Budapest last year. That senior success followed the four medals he gained at the past two editions of the World U20 Championships, as he claimed 100m gold and 200m silver in both 2021 and 2022.", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ogando", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Ogando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fahnbulleh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Fahnbulleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_U20_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics U20 Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/66b511c4774392f56dca87b1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He said that decision had not been made as of late Thursday.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race. This time -- nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\n\"To be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy for today.\"\n\n___\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He celebrated very enthusiastically after that finish.\n\nOn Thursday, Lyles limped away from the finish line and collapsed on the track of the Stade de France, showing obvious signs of exhaustion. Trainers tended to the track star, giving him water and getting him a wheelchair, before he left the area.\n\n\"I woke up early about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning and I was just feeling really horrible,\" Lyles told NBC. \"I knew it was more than just being sore from the 100. I went to doctor's and we tested, and unfortunately it came back that I was positive with COVID.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic. I've been in worse situations. I've run with worse conditions. We took it day-by-day, trying to hydrate as much [as possible] and quarantined off.\n\n\"It's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get the bronze medal.\"\n\nLyles, who wore a mask during his interview on NBC, said he never considering withdrawing from the 200-meter final. He also was seen wearing a mask before the race, but was not wearing one earlier this week during a news conference or in other media interviews.\n\nUnlike the previous Olympics, athletes are not required to undergo daily COVID-19 testing in Paris.\n\n\"I just said we were just going to try and quarantine as much as possible, stay away, not try to pass it off and just give it my all,\" Lyles said. \"If I wasn't to make it and somebody would have taken my spot, that would have been my sign that I didn't deserve to be in the final.\"\n\nThe men's 4x100-meter relay final is scheduled for 1:47 p.m. EDT Friday in Saint-Denis. Lyles said he didn't know if he would compete.\n\n\"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,\" Lyles said. \"They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\n\n\"If that's the case, coming off of today, then I'm perfectly fine saying 'do your thing.

Lyles didn't get off to a great start, but picked up the pace in the middle part of the race. He wasn't able to catch up to Letsile Tebogo from Botswana however, and finished a disappointing third.\n\nAfter the race though, he had an explanation for his underwhelming performance: he has COVID. Except...his entrance to the 200meter event sure didn't seem like he was suffering too many ill effects.\n\nSeemingly overwhelmed by the 20 seconds of exertion though, Lyles was then taken off the track in a wheelchair.\n\nStill, the media's obsessive assertions that coming down with COVID required strict isolation and would clearly hamper performances took a major hit Thursday. As it has for the entire Olympics.\n\nREAD: Is COVID Officially Over?

They've proven with great certainty they can handle it without me. And if that's the case coming off of today, I'm perfectly fine, saying 'you guys go do your thing. You guys have more than enough speed to be able to handle it and get the gold medal.'\"\n\nIt does seem a bit odd that Lyles would be jumping around before the race, if he felt that bad, and that he'd still secure a bronze medal in a very competitive race.

And shortly after that, he was also seen being wheeled out in a wheelchair with Olympic medical staff surrounding him.\n\nAs it turns out, Lyles has COVID.\n\nThat certainly throws quite a wrench into things. Here's everything we know about the track star's diagnoses so far.\n\nWait, Noah Lyles has COVID-19?\n\nYes, apparently so. He was diagnosed with COVID two days ago. He confirmed his diagnosis with reporters after the race.\n\nHe said he kept it \"close to the vest\" and didn't want competitors to know he was ill. The signs were there. Lyles had been wearing a mask and quarantining leading up to the race.\n\nHow in the world was he still allowed to race?\n\nTechnically, there is no COVID protocol for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Athletes are not being barred from competing if they get the virus.\n\nChief medical officer of the Olympics, Jon Finnoff, said Team USA is following the CDC guidelines for all infectious disease protocols, USA Today's Carrie McDonald reports.\n\nIf a Team USA athlete experiences symptoms of any kind, Finnoff reiterated the USOPC is \"going to follow the CDC guidelines for all of infectious disease protocols.\"\n\n\"It doesn't mean [infected athletes] can't train or compete,\" Finnoff said. \"We'll do that based on their symptoms and how they feel, but we do want to prevent [them] from infecting those around them, and we'll also provide prophylaxis based on what is recommended by CDC guidelines.\"\n\nLyles isn't the only athlete at the Games with COVID. At least 40 athletes have tested positive so far, according to Yahoo! Sports.\n\nWell, is Lyles OK?\n\nHe definitely didn't look it after the race. He immediately fell to the ground after the race and then was put in a wheelchair after.\n\nHe addressed the media after, but the immediate aftermath of the race was certainly concerning.\n\nWill Lyles be available for the 4\u00d7100?\n\nThe answer is probably not at this point. Lyles said after the race that he's leaning toward not participating.\n\n\"At the moment I don't know. I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me. And if that's the case coming off of today, I'm perfectly fine saying, 'Hey, you guys go do your thing. '\"\n\nSounds like a guy who knows he won't be able to compete. We'll see how he feels in a few days.\n\nThe most important thing is his health, though. So, hopefully, he feels better soon.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

He burst out of the blocks and navigated the bend with his trademark speed and grace. But as the race reached its climax, the effects of the virus began to take their toll, and Lyles couldn't maintain his pace.

Immediately after the race, Lyles was seen sitting in a chair and being wheeled off the track, raising concerns about his physical condition.\n\nFormer US Olympic great Michael Johnson, who was providing commentary for the BBC, offered his analysis, saying, \"He certainly isn't carrying an injury because you can't do this with an injury, you can't run 19.70.\" Johnson suggested that Lyles' performance was likely affected by some form of illness that had \"zapped his energy.\"\n\nLyles' performance affected by illness, not injury\n\nShortly after the race, the news broke that Lyles had indeed tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the event. His decision to compete despite the illness was a testament to his determination and competitive spirit, but it also highlighted the challenges athletes face when dealing with the lingering effects of the virus.\n\nTebogo's historic victory made him the first African to win the 200m title, and in doing so, he secured Botswana's first-ever Olympic gold medal. The young sprinter's dominant performance cemented his status as one of the rising stars in the sport, clocking the fifth-fastest time in history over the distance.\n\nBednarek's silver medal was a testament to his own consistency and resilience, as he claimed his second successive silver in the 200m event.

He was good enough to make it into that event's final, anyway.\n\nThe 200 is Lyles' preferred, and better, distance - one at which he had not lost a race in three full years. That streak was snapped at the Stade de France, where Letsile Tebogo of Botswana beat him to the line by crossing in 19.96 seconds, 0.12 faster than runner-up Lyles.\n\nThey'll have a rematch for the gold on Thursday night.\n\nGetting golds in the 100 and 200 at a single Olympics is a rare feat. Usain Bolt accomplished that double at three Olympics in a row - in Beijing in 2008, London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016. But until the Jamaican, no man had done it since Carl Lewis at Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nAt his last Games, eight years ago, Bolt was shutting it down late in his 200 semi-final, and suddenly realized Andre De Grasse was running hard. So Bolt dialled his speed back up and wagged a finger at the Canadian. Fast-forward to the final: Bolt won easily.\n\nBefore pulling out his narrow win over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in the 100 final on Sunday night, Lyles didn't finish first in his heat or his semi-final.\n\nAs anyone who pays any attention is well aware, Lyles is a showman who loves the spotlight and enjoys spending time with a microphone.\n\nThat's obvious from his mean-mugging and gesturing on the purple track in Paris before he runs or such statements as the offhand comparison between track and the NBA that went viral last year: \"The thing that hurts me the most is I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'World Champion' on their head,\" Lyles said. \"World champion of what? The United States?\"\n\nSo it raised some eyebrows when Lyles skipped the interview area after Wednesday's run, and U.S. team officials said he was heading to the medical tent. His coach, Lance Brauman, told The Associated Press: \"He's fine.\"\n\nThat might just add a bit more intrigue in the 24 hours until the medals are at stake.\n\nThere already was plenty.\n\nIs Lyles, a 27-year-old from Florida, at his best? How much did he care about the semi-final, when lane placements are determined but all that truly matters is moving on to the round that determines the medals? Will Lyles find some extra fuel from being outdone in front of a full house of about 80,000?\n\nWas the 21-year-old Tebogo, the 200 bronze medalist at worlds but making his Olympic debut, trying to send a message? Is he ready to challenge for a gold?\n\nAnd what about Kenny Bednarek, Lyles's U.S. teammate and the Tokyo Games silver medalist, who ran in a different semi-final and won it in 20 seconds flat, the evening's second-fastest time? Or Erryion Knighton, a 20-year-old American seen as the next threat, but whose only victories over Lyles came in the opening rounds of the 2021 Olympic trials.", "source": {"uri":

Lyles shook his head.\n\n\"I just needed some time,\" he said. \"So they wheeled me off the track.\"\n\nThe world's fastest man, it seemed, had been slowed by COVID.\n\nDays after winning gold in a thrilling, historic 100 meters, a weakened Lyles struggled to finish third in his specialty, the 200, at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won his country's first-ever gold medal with a time of 19.46 and Kenny Bednarek of the U.S. was second.\n\nThe 21-year-old Tebogo, a rising star in track, slapped his chest as he crossed the finish line.\n\n\"It was really a beautiful race for me,\" said Tebogo, who recently lost his mother and had written her birth date on his shoes. \"We had our ups and downs, but we just made sure that we pulled through and made it to the Olympics.\"\n\nThe result ended Lyles' quest to win the 100, 200 and 400 relay -- the coveted sprint triple last achieved by the legendary Usain Bolt. Unbeknownst to almost everyone, Lyle's chances had taken a serious hit days beforehand.\n\nThe trouble arose early Tuesday morning, about 36 hours after his 100 victory.\n\n\"I woke up in the middle of the night just feeling really chills, aching, sore throat,\" he said. \"And those are kind of a lot of the symptoms I've always had right before getting COVID.\"\n\nA test came back positive and U.S. officials quietly moved him to a hotel outside the athletes village where he remained, taking Paxlovid, for the next few days. Only his coach and family knew the nature of his absence.\n\n\"Why would you want to tell your competitors you're sick?\" said Lyles, who joined British swimmer Adam Peaty and Australian swimmers Lani Pallister and Zac Stubblety-Cook among athletes who competed with COVID during the Olympics. \"Why would you want to give them an edge over you?\"\n\nBecause of relaxed health protocols at the Games, Lyles was allowed to continue training and competing in the early rounds of the 200. If he looked a bit off, that wasn't too unusual -- his 100 prelims had been lackluster.\n\nThough his girlfriend -- Jamaican runner Junelle Bromfield -- told him that he had been coughing all night, the symptoms seemed to fade by Thursday morning.\n\nDuring introductions for the 200, Lyles burst onto the track like always, jumping up and down, pumping his fists. When the race began, he gambled on a fast start but could not muster the kind of finish that has carried him to victories in the past.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" he said of the illness, estimating that he felt \"like 90 percent to 95 percent\" of full strength.\n\nTebogo, meanwhile, came off the curve looking strong. After seeing Lyles' victory at the world championships last year, he had trained hard on that aspect of his race and was able to generate momentum to carry him down the home stretch.\n\nBednarek, wearing a trademark headband tied at the back, tried to follow but could not close the gap, repeating his silver-medal finish from three years ago in Tokyo.\n\n\"This race wasn't what I wanted,\" the American said, \"but I'm happy to be back on the podium.\"\n\nMoments after the finish, Lyles sank down and lay on the track, fighting shortness of breath and chest pains. Medical staff brought him water and helped him to his feet before eventually taking him away in a wheelchair. His mother came down from the stands, chasing after him down that hallway.\n\nAlmost an hour later, the sprinter appeared before reporters wearing a black face mask. Withdrawing from the 200 had never crossed his mind, he said. As for running the relay on Friday, he would leave that decision to his coaches and teammates.\n\nConsidering his rough night, Lyles sounded surprisingly upbeat.\n\n\"To be honest,\" he said, \"I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\n\u00a92024 Los Angeles Times.

bronze in 19.70sec.\n\nThe sole African to have won a short sprint title at an Olympic Games is South African Reggie Walker, over 100m at the 1908 Games in London.\n\nThe final lacked the pre-race hype of the 100m, falling mid-session at a packed Stade de France.\n\nLyles was given a huge reception when introduced as cameras showed him up on the big screens at either end of the stadium.\n\nThe newly crowned 100m champion was drawn in lane five, outside Alexander Ogando and inside American teammate Erriyon Knighton, while Tebogo was in seven.\n\nThe American bounded into the stadium, as he had done before the 100m final, cupping his ear to the crowd.\n\nTebogo, however, walked quietly on and went straight to his blocks.\n\nAfter the gun went for the start, Lyles was quickly up on Ogando.\n\nHe, Tebogo and Bednarek all rounded the bend well, but coming into the home straight, Lyles was in third spot.\n\nTebogo looked in total control, even relaxing as he went through the finish line, making a brushing-off gesture with his hand on his sky blue vest.\n\nBednarek held on for silver, with Lyles prone on the track after being unable to replicate his gold medal showing in the

In a press conference ahead of the 200m, Lyles was discussing his objective for the race before stopping himself and saying while laughing: 'I'll be winning.'\n\nAmerican teammate Fred Kerley then said while sat next to him: 'Talk your s**t'. Lyles responded: 'That man ain't winning, none of them is winning. When I come off the turn, they will be depressed.'\n\nAfter his words came back to bite him on Thursday, fans took to social media to mock the Olympian for predicting that his competitors would be left 'depressed' when he came round the bend. One said on X: 'Guess Noah Lyles [is] the only person depressed after the turn'. Another commented: 'Saw a video of Noah Lyles saying at the bend his competitors will be depressed. Guess who is now'.\n\n'Noah Lyles said everyone was gonna be depressed when they hit that turn.... Wellllllll,' wrote a third. A fourth put: 'Noah Lyles is definitely the depressed one now - loud mouth'. A fifth posted: 'Noah Lyles was talking about how these guy's will be depressed only to lose. There's a fine line between confidence and arrogance.'\n\nWhile another said: 'Talked that s**t and didn't back it up this time'. Following his third-place finish, the disappointment soon gave way to a frightful scene as Lyles was wheeled away from the track by medics.\n\nIt has since been claimed that the 100m champion ran Thursday's 200m with Covid, which may well explain his slow start. NBC said they spoke to his mom, who confirmed he had the virus but still decided to run at the Olympics.\n\nLyles was plagued by a slow start Thursday and was unable to catch Bednarek, who had been the top runner in the 200 throughout the ongoing Paris Olympics. He now has two bronze medals in the 200, following his third-place finish at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

at Olympic sprint double in 200m", "body": "American Noah Lyles has the chance to become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete an Olympic sprint double after qualifying for the 200m final at Paris 2024.\n\nLyles won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday.\n\nThe 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, finished second in his 200m semi-final in 20.08 seconds to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nWorld 100m silver and 200m bronze medallist Tebogo set the fastest time of the round at Stade de France on Wednesday evening, clocking 19.96 seconds.\n\nThe Olympic men's 200m final takes place on Friday at 6.30am NZT.\n\nKenneth Bednarek, of the United States, also set a faster time than Lyles, in 20.00, while compatriot Erriyon Knighton, who upgraded to world 200m silver last year, also safely progressed.\n\nBut Canada's Andre de Grasse will not defend his title in the final after finishing third in his race (20.41).\n\nThe Olympic 200m bronze winner three years ago, Lyles claimed world 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold in Budapest last year.\n\nFollowing that achievement, when he became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to complete a 100m and 200m world double, he claimed he could look to add the 4x400m relay title to that treble haul in Paris.\n\nJamaican sprint legend Bolt completed individual sprint doubles at three successive Olympic Games among his eight titles, adding relay gold in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOnly nine men have achieved that double in the history of the Games.\n\nLyles became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, with his narrow triumph.\n\nA three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will line up as favourite as

USA Track & Field had made clear it was Lyles's decision to participate in Thursday night's final.\n\nRelated: Lyles wins 200m bronze before Covid diagnosis revealed as Tebogo takes gold\n\nLyles, the freshly crowned Olympic 100m champion, was unable to keep pace with the gold medallist, \u00adBotswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.46) or his US teammate \u00adKenneth Bednarek (19.62), who took silver. Lyles's appearance in a wheelchair immediately drew speculation about his medical condition.\n\nThe 27-year-old soon clarified his situation. \"I do have Covid,\" Lyles said. \"I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday. I woke up feeling chills, aching, sore throat. Those were a lot of the symptoms I have had before getting Covid. I was like: 'I need to test this one.' It came back positive so we quickly quarantined in a hotel near the village and they got me on as much medication as they legally could to make sure my body was able to keep the momentum going.\n\n\"I still wanted to run, they said it was still possible so we stayed away from everybody and took it round by round. I have definitely had better days but I am walking around again. I was quite light headed after that race and the chest pain was definitely active. After a while I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. I am feeling a lot better now. It definitely affected my performance.\"\n\nIn a statement, USA Track & Field said: \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough \u00admedical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe Paris Olympics has no mandatory rules relating to Covid and participation, meaning Lyles was within his rights to take to the start line. Covid has been a lingering feature of the Games, having affected Australian water polo players and swimmers from various nations, including \u00adBritain's Adam Peaty.\n\nLyles answered a firm \"no\" when asked whether withdrawing from the 200m was ever a consideration. \"I was going to compete regardless,\" he added. \"If I didn't make the final, that would have been the sign not to compete.\"\n\nStill, Lyles's attitude will raise eyebrows. His girlfriend is the Jamaican athlete Junelle Bromfield, with whom he admitted sharing a bed while in the hotel. \"Junelle said I was coughing through the night last night,\" Lyles said. \"I thought I had a good sleep but she said she had to keep moving me through the night to make sure I would stop coughing. I am more proud of myself than \u00adanything. Coming out and winning the bronze medal after three days with Covid ... it has been a wild Olympics.\"\n\nNo other members of the US team had been informed of Lyles's diagnosis before the 200m final. \"The only people who knew were the medical staff, my coach, my mum and my family,\" said Lyles.\n\n\"We tried to keep this as close to the chest as possible. We didn't want everybody going into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete. You also never want to tell your competitors you are sick. Why would you give them an advantage over you?\"\n\nBednarek, who hugged Lyles after the final, seemed to have no worries about any danger attached to that. \"I don't care,\" said the silver \u00admedallist. \"I don't view those things as a big deal.

It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you? See you next time.'\n\nLyles used the earlier portion of his post to thank fans for their support and congratulate Letsile Tebogo and USA teammate Kenny Bednarek on their gold and silver medal wins respectively.\n\n'First I want to thank God for getting me through this entire Olympics! Second I want to congratulate @tebogo_letsile_ , @kenny_bednarek and everyone else on an amazing Olympic 200m final,' he wrote.\n\n'Finally I want to thank everyone for the supportive messages.'\n\nLyles' post was met with more messages of support as American tennis star Coco Gauff commented 'unreal' with a gold medal emoji.\n\nTeam USA fencer Miles Chamley-Watson also commented 'keep being a [star] bruv.'\n\nEarlier in the evening, Lyles had at least left the door open to competing in the 4\u00d7100 relay, but admitted he was leaning towards sitting out.\n\n'At the moment I don't know, I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,' he said. 'They have proven they can handle it without me.'\n\nLyles labored to a third-place finish in Thursday's 200m final before it was revealed that he was battling COVID.\n\nThe American sprinter was placed in a wheelchair and looked visibly out of breath following the race.\n\nHe later explained to NBC that he woke up on Tuesday morning 'feeling really horrible.'\n\n'I knew it was more than being sore from the 100,' he continued. 'My first thought was not to panic, I've been in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\n'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.'\n\nTrack legend Michael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to compete with COVID, saying on the BBC: 'Very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It is just bizarre, the whole thing is really weird.\n\n'There is going to be all of this thing with the Noah haters out there - and he set himself up for it - there are going to be people out there saying it's not real and he's faking or whatever.\n\n'But putting that aside, having Covid and still coming out here and being in close proximity with other people - I know there probably is not a policy I guess at these Games for that - but morally I'm not sure about it.'\n\nNotably, Lyles later said that the other competitors were unaware of his diagnosis: 'We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mom knew.\n\n'We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick. Why would you give them an edge?'\n\nOn Friday, Lyles' foes now won't have to worry about him during the 4\u00d7100 relay, as Team USA looks to add to its gold medal tally.\n\nThrough Thursday, the United States is leading the Games in both total medals and golds, with 103 overall medals and 30 first-place finishes.\n\nChina are just behind in that second category, with 29 golds, while Australia are third with an impressive 18.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Chamley-Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Chamley-Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/09/00/88322261-13725933-Noah_Lyles_ran_the_men_s_200m_final_in_Paris_with_Covid_it_has_b-a-21_1723160629195.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

His victory not only earned him the gold but also made him the fifth-fastest man in history over the 200m distance.\n\nKenny Bednarek, who took silver in the event at the Tokyo Olympics, repeated the feat, finishing in 19.62 seconds. Noah Lyles, the triple world champion who had been aiming to become the first American to achieve the sprint double since Carl Lewis 40 years ago, settled for bronze with a time of 19.67 seconds. Lyles' performance marked his first defeat in a 200m final in three years.\n\nThe U.S. team revealed that Lyles had tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, just two days after winning gold in the 100 meters. Despite the diagnosis, Lyles chose to compete, and U.S. officials implemented all necessary health protocols to ensure the safety of all athletes.\n\nAdding to the drama, Lyles received a yellow card for a misconduct violation after damaging his lane box before the race began, further complicating his night.\n\nA Historic Night for Africa\n\nWhile much of the attention was on Lyles, it was undoubtedly Tebogo's night, symbolizing a monumental moment for African athletics. Traditionally dominant in middle and long-distance events, this was the first time in Olympic history that four African sprinters competed in a 200m final. Though three of them finished in the last three positions, Tebogo's record-breaking win marked a significant leap forward for the continent.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion -- it's something I have never seen in my life or even dreamt of. It is an amazing moment,\" Tebogo said after the race. \"I knew Kenny was going to run away, so I made sure to close him down. I have that top-end speed that allows me to finish the race strong. When I saw Kenny fade, I knew Noah was far behind us, and that's when I realized I was the Olympic champion.\"\n\nTebogo's triumph is more than just a personal achievement; it represents a milestone for Botswana, Africa, and his family.\n\nFor Bednarek, who ran a strong race from lane eight, the result was bittersweet. \"I don't think I put my best race down. It was really tight at the end,\" he said. \"This year, I'm finally healthy. I can build off this. There's also the world championships next year. I'm going to be dangerous. I expect big things in the next four years.\"\n\nTebogo's victory is a testament to the growing prowess of African athletes in sprinting, and it sets the stage for even greater achievements in the future.", "source": {"uri": "thezimbabwemail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Zimbabwe Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Letsile-Tebogo.png?fit=1200%2C731&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

When you see her go, you understand how her specialty is unique. Most other runners just don't make it look this easy, because they can't make it look this easy. Her form is perfect. Every time. You know how we see these world records get broken with every Olympics and the times are wildly improved from athletes two generations prior? That's what it's like watching McLaughlin-Levrone, only she's doing it against contemporaries.\n\nIt's like she beamed back from the future. That's how much better she is than the field.\n\nGiven the way she has separated from her competition and redefined the boundaries of what's physically possible in women's hurdling, she can fairly be called the greatest hurdler of all time.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the sports world bore witness once again to her transcendent dominance.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone set her sixth world record in the 400 hurdles, easily winning gold by running and hurdling the big purple oval at Stade de France in 50.37 seconds. (Her time was so good it would've nearly landed McLaughlin-Levrone in the 400-meter finals -- the race without the hurdles.)\n\nThe win gives McLaughlin-Levrone an astonishing reality: She is the only woman to ever win back-to-back gold medals in the 400m hurdles. What a phenomenal Olympian. McLaughlin-Levrone can claim supremacy over her sport like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky do in theirs. It is a joy to watch her so effortlessly gallup past so-called competitors. It makes the pre-race chatter even more hilarious after the fact. Prior to Thursday's run there was faint curiosity if this event would wind up being the scene of yet another upset in track at these Olympics. After all, they'd been popping up with regularity; we even saw it materialize in the men's 200-meter final. (More on that in just a moment.)\n\nWould Femke Bol of the Netherlands run the race of her life and out-do McLaughlin-Levrone? Turns out she couldn't even out-do Anna Cockrell. Cockrell, an American, took silver (51.87) behind McLaughlin-Levrone, while Bol had to settle for bronze (52.15).\n\nAt 25 years old, these Games represent the true star turn for McLaughlin-Levrone. She burst onto the scene in Tokyo, and, yes, in the track and field world she's been the envy of most for years. But in showing out so definitively in front of fans on the Paris stages, McLaughlin-Levrone upped her profile to the highest tier for an American Olympian, especially when you factor in how she hasn't lost in the 400m hurdles in five years.\n\nShe's expected to run again in 2028 at the Los Angeles Games, and it's there and then when she could opt to go supernova status. Her talent is so obvious, the temptation to expand her program and run the 400 (sans hurdles), or the 200-meter dash, or basically any race she wants, will be there.\n\nThe hype will be earned and widespread. McLaughlin-Levrone has already cemented her reputation among the all-time great American Olympians. In 2028, she goes for pantheon status. We'll all be waiting, eagerly, to see her chase it.\n\nAnd speaking of pantheon status ...\n\nNoah Lyles' bid for the double halted by COVID\n\nNoah Lyles had something rarely attainable available to him at these Games. The 2024 Olympics were set up to catapult the gifted track speedster to American superstardom, to be the face of American track. In order to truly break through to all-time status, Lyles -- an elite sprinter -- would need to clear two massive hurdles in order to get there.\n\nHe had to pull off the grueling, ever-coveted double: win gold in both the 100- and 200-meter dashes.\n\nCarl Lewis is the only American to ever do that. Lyles got halfway there on Sunday night when he roared from behind to barely beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in one of the most dramatic 100-meter finals in history. Lyles' chest beat Thompson's torso by five one-thousandths of a second: 9.784 to 9.789 seconds.\n\nThen, a conspicuous thing in the past two days. Lyles was seen wearing a medical face mask prior to stepping into the open air of Stade de France. Was it precautionary?\n\nNo. It was COVID. We now know that, because Lyles confirmed as much on Thursday after he failed in his quest to take the double. This also explains why Lyles didn't even finish first in his semifinal heat on Wednesday.\n\n\"I woke up early, about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning, and I just was feeling really horrible, and I knew that it was more than being sore from the 100\" Lyles said on NBC. \"My first thought was not to panic. I was thinking I've been in worse situations, I've run with worse conditions, I felt, and we just took it day by day, trying to hydrate as much, quarantined off.\"\n\nLyles, whose competitive spirit is as evident as any athlete at these Olympics, said he never debated not running in the 200. (If you weren't aware, it's been official Olympics policy to allow athletes to compete while having COVID, in essence treating it like other common respiratory illnesses.)\n\nRunning sick, Lyles still managed to earn a bronze, but he was clearly not himself. He was beaten by his Team USA comrade, Kenny Bednarek, who took silver, and was downright dusted by Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, who won the gold after running the fifth-fastest 200 in history.\n\nTebogo sprinted to first in 19.46 seconds. Bednarek reached the line in 19.62, while Lyles was well off his personal-best time of 19.31 that he set two years ago.\n\nDown (but not out) with disease, Lyles would've needed to run something borderline alien in order to win gold. Tebogo won the first gold for Africa ever in the 200. It was also the first gold for Botswana in any Olympic event.\n\n\"It's taken its toll for sure,\" Lyles said on NBC after the race. \"But I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here, and getting a bronze medal, where last Olympics I was very disappointed. This time, I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nLyles' outspoken nature has led to him be something of a polarizing athlete. He infamously took aim at NBA players for proclaiming \"world champion\" status despite competing only on North American soil. So the loss was a moment for his critics to crow.\n\nExcept, peer into the race through his eyes. Work for four years, and not run in the 200? It was policy to allow him to compete with COVID. Obviously he was going to give it a go. When Lyles -- who has long battled asthma, remember -- says he's proud of winning bronze, I believe him. It's understandable how we expect U.S. athletes to win gold and can feel let down when they fall short of that. But the Olympics hand out three prizes for a reason.\n\nSometimes, just making it to the podium can feel like a victory. Lyles got the 100. Ironically, his best event is where his body failed him, through little fault of his own.\n\nHe leaves Paris with at least two medals. And now we wonder: Is Lyles' Olympics over? He was on pace to run the anchor leg in the 4x100 relay, but Lyles indicated he wasn't likely to run in it when asked by Lewis Johnson on NBC on Thursday. So, we'll wait and see there.\n\nThat's the tricky thing about these races.

Nah. Noah Lyles's positive test for COVID-19 is not an excuse for his surprising third-place performance in the men's 200-meter final on Thursday night. But it was a factor-and there is a big difference, in sports, between factors and excuses.\n\nClaiming he lost because he's never run on a purple track would be an excuse. Blaming refs is almost always an excuse. Complaining that your hotel-room pillow was too soft, your bus driver drove too slow, or your socks were too tight: Excuse, excuse, excuse.\n\nWhat happened to Lyles is just part of sports, which are designed, in the most basic sense, to measure which humans perform specific tasks best at a specific time on a specific day. Sometimes you tweak your ankle, sometimes you're distracted by something happening in your personal life, and sometimes you're an asthmatic who gets COVID-19 in the most important week of your career. If the International Olympic Committee insisted that all participants be at their mental and physical best at the moment of competition, no event would ever take place.\n\nSo congrats to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, whose time of 19.46 seconds was more than worthy of gold. Congrats to American Kenny Bednarek for grabbing silver and congrats to Lyles for somehow running a 200 in 19.70 seconds, just two days after he-his words-\"woke up in the middle of the night just feeling, really, chills, aching, sore throat.\" Lyles bounced into the stadium like he always does. But by the end of the race, he appeared to be laboring.\n\n\"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days,\" he said. \"I still wouldn't say I'm 100%, but I'd definitely say I'm closer to like 90 to 95 percent ... I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out and [getting] the bronze medal.\"\n\nHe should be proud. He should also rest up, see if he feels strong enough to run in the 4X100 relay Friday, and definitely not read the next paragraph.\n\nBednarek and Lyles have faced each other in the 200-meter dash 13 times. Lyles has finished ahead of Bednarek in 11 of them. The other two were in the Olympics.\n\nLyles thrives on showmanship, and at the Tokyo Olympics, there were no fans and therefore no show. The atmosphere in Paris was much more to his liking. He won the 100 meters by one sixteenth of a goose bump. The 200 figured to be the easier race for him; after the 100, he had promised he would win. (Or at least he promised that everybody else in the final would be unhappy with the result, which I took as a promise he would win.)\n\nLyles did not announce he tested positive until after the race. His coaches, his doctors, his family and his girlfriend, Junelle Bromfield-a Jamaican sprinter who is also competing in Paris-knew about his diagnosis. But they also knew that the 200 would happen whether he ran or not. Lyles said he never considered withdrawing.\n\nWhen a reporter asked if his COVID-19 medication was PAXLOVID, Lyles paused, said \"I can't remember the name of it,\" and laughed at the absurdity of it. An official near him confirmed it was PAXLOVID.\n\n\"Even Junelle was saying that I was coughing through the night last night,\" Lyles said. \"I thought I had a good night's sleep, but she said she had to keep moving me through the night to make sure that I would stop coughing.\"\n\nBecause Lyles basically guaranteed a victory and ended up getting bronze, there will inevitably be whispers that COVID-19 was a convenient excuse. The theory makes sense until you think about it for, oh, two seconds.\n\nQuickly now: Lyles's asthma has been well-documented. COVID-19 symptoms can be especially severe for patients with asthma. Lyles left the Olympic Village, stayed in a hotel, changed his preparatory regimen before the biggest 200 of his career-and then, after he finished, he fell to the track and was taken out of the stadium in a wheelchair. He put on a mask and told reporters if he wasn't healthy enough to run in the 4X100 relay Friday, he would tell the coaches.\n\nOf course he was sick, and of course it affected him-and of course it doesn't really matter. They held the men's 200 at the Olympics this week, Noah Lyles was the third-fastest man in the final and that's that.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Don't Blame COVID-19 for

Why Not You!\"\n\nLyles has been open about the obstacles he's faced throughout his career. Here's everything you need to know about his mental health journey, including how the USA sprinter overcame depression and anxiety on the way to an Olympic gold medal.\n\nUSA OLYMPICS MEDAL COUNT: Overall table | U.S. medal tracker | Who has won gold?\n\nSince he began taking track seriously after watching the 2012 Olympics, the sport has been Lyles' refuge. When he was sprinting, he didn't have to worry about anything else.\n\nThat didn't mean it was always easy. After having struggled with asthma, bullying and learning difficulties because of his ADD and dyslexia at a young age, Lyles and his brother, Josephus, turned professional in 2016, forgoing collegiate careers.\n\nLyles began to struggle mentally before his first outdoor world championships in Doha in 2019. After living out of hotel rooms in Europe for some time during the season, he was growing homesick -- even winning the 200m race at worlds that year didn't fully improve his mood.\n\nThen, the pandemic hit and Lyles lost his \"twinkle,\" his therapist told TIME. He struggled to talk, experiencing constant fatigue and difficulty breathing. He was depressed, and the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 only drove him into a deeper hole.\n\nMORE: Best Noah Lyles 100m photos\n\nLyles began taking antidepressants that summer but ended up tapering them down before beginning his next track season. Feeling a bit better, Lyles qualified in the 200-meter race for the postponed 2021 Tokyo Olympics and entered the Games as the favorite for gold.\n\nUnfortunately, Josephus did not qualify with him, nixing a dream the two brothers had. Without the crowd to rile him on and Josephus at his side, Lyles struggled in the 200-meter final and only captured bronze. It was immediately after this race that Lyles broke down publicly for the first time and expressed his struggles with mental health.\n\n\"I knew there was a lot of people out there like me who's scared to say something or to even start that journey,\" he said. \"I want you to know that it's OK to not feel good, and you can go out and talk to somebody professionally, or even get on medication, because this is a serious issue and you don't want to wake up one day and just think, you know, 'I don't want to be here anymore.'\n\n\"This wasn't even my dream,\" Lyles continued as he sobbed to reporters after the race. \"I just wanted to tag along because I loved my brother, and I wanted to do this together. And it's taken us so far, and I feel like he should be here.\"\n\nSince then, Lyles has defied the odds and overcome his struggles, continuing to cement himself as one of the greatest American sprinters of all time -- and one of the best in the world.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josephus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Learning disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/nba-plain--57826127-6df6-4479-9447-1fbbf36ef4b0.jpeg?itok=dMo6croi", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1882, "textEnd": 1890}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

'I do have Covid. I tested positive around 5:00 am on Tuesday morning.\n\n'I woke up in the middle of the night feeling chills, aching, sore throat.\n\n'I knew it was more than just being sore from the 100. We woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for Covid.'\n\nCovid woes aside, the night belonged to the ground-breaking Tebogo.\n\nThe sole African previously to have won a short sprint title at an Olympic Games is South African Reggie Walker, over 100m at the 1908 Games in London.\n\nTebogo's time saw him leapfrog American Erriyon Knighton to go fifth fastest in the all-time list. The gold was also Botswana's first ever at an Olympics.\n\n'It was really a beautiful race for me,' Tebogo said. 'When we made it to the final, my coach just told me, 'Now my job is done, it's up to you to see what you can do. Whether it's a medal or not, just finish the race healthy'.\n\n'That's all I could've wished for. I'm happy I finished the race healthier than before.'\n\nTebogo's gold is even more impressive given that he lost his mother Seratiwa in May. His running shoes bear his late mother's date of birth.\n\n'It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field,' said the sprinter, who took a month off training and competition after her death.\n\n'It gives me a lot of motivation. She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy. I didn't want to put the date of her death, because I'll get emotional.'\n\nTebogo added: 'I'm really grateful for the team around me. They really pushed me through thick and thin.\n\n'We had our ups and downs, but we just made sure that we pulled through and made it to the Olympics.'\n\nThe final lacked the pre-race hype of the 100m, falling mid-session at a packed Stade de France.\n\nLyles was given a huge reception when introduced as cameras showed him up on the big screens at either end of the stadium.\n\nThe newly crowned 100m champion was drawn in lane five, outside Alexander Ogando and inside American teammate Knighton, while Tebogo was in seven inside Bednarek.\n\nThe American bounded into the stadium, as he had done before the 100m final, cupping his ear to the crowd, but his exuberant showboating saw him yellow-carded for breaking the starting block.\n\nTebogo, however, was an image of calmness, walking quietly on and going straight to his blocks.\n\nAfter the gun went for the start, Lyles was quickly up on Ogando.\n\nHe, Tebogo and Bednarek all rounded the bend well, but coming into the home straight, Lyles was in third spot.\n\nBut Tebogo looked in total control, even relaxing as he went through the finish line, making a brushing-off gesture to the rest of the field.\n\nBednarek held on for silver, with Lyles prone on the track after being unable to replicate his gold medal showing in the 100m.\n\n'I came out here wanting to win, but I have to settle for silver again,' said Bednarek, who was also second at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\n'I didn't put the best race down, but Tebogo ran a really good race.'", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New

That was the strategy.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I am more proud of myself than anything. Coming out and getting the bronze medal with Covid.\n\n\"We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mum knew.\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic.

seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of - it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old Tebogo said.\n\n\"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew when the gun went Kenny was going to run away so make sure just to close him down, I have that top end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"\n\nBednarek, who also won silver in Tokyo, finished in 19.62

bronze medal position for the rest of the race, finishing in 19.70.\n\nTebogo and Bednarek battled for their positions, the American holding the lead just after the halfway point, but it was the Botswanan's race to lose from the 120m mark and he never looked close to letting go.\n\nLyles, who was also issued a yellow card for breaking his starting block, was whisked away to a medical consultation after the race.\n\nIn other news, American Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke the women's 400m hurdles world record with a time of 50.37 seconds to retain her Olympic title.\n\nAnna Cockrell of the United States took silver and Dutchwoman Femke Bol claimed bronze.\n\nArshad Nadeem clinched Pakistan's first Olympic medal in athletics in the men's javelin, beating defending champion Neeraj Chopra of India.\n\nNadeem broke the Olympic record on his second throw with a stunning 92.97 metres - the best in the world this year.\n\nChopra, favourite to win, looked off his best form, and 89.45 was also his only valid attempt as he fouled on his five other attempts.\n\nGrenada's Anderson Peters won bronze with 88.54, a redemptive moment for the two-time world champion after he failed to make it to the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nKeep up to date with the action from the Paris 2024 Olympics across Sky Sports digital platforms and Sky Sports News every day between now and

A little more than 20 seconds later, international focus quickly shifted from the result on Thursday to something that had happened on Tuesday: a positive COVID test.\n\nImmediately after crossing the finish line, Lyles made his way to an area just outside the track and then slowly got on the ground. He had difficulty breathing, and trainers eventually took him to a medical tent in a wheelchair for medical treatment. Within moments of his treatment, it came out that Lyles ran his specialty race with COVID.\n\nNews of the positive COVID test first became public through the BBC, which got confirmation from USA Track and Field and announced it on the network's post-race analysis show. A few minutes later, NBC also reported the positive COVID test after reporter Lewis Johnson ran down to the track in search of answers and spoke to Lyles' mother.\n\nWhile not every COVID diagnosis is the same -- the CDC's guidelines for isolation are to only wait for symptom to improve, and asymptomatic positive tests do happen -- Lyles' illness was reportedly on the more severe side. Speaking with Johnson after finishing treatment, Lyles said that he felt \"really horrible\" early Tuesday and woke up his doctors to get tested. He did not clarify whether his symptoms improved in time for the race, but he did say that while the symptoms affected him, he downplayed what he was going through.\n\n\"My first thought was not to panic,\" Lyles said. \"Thinking, 'I've been in worse situations.' I've run with worse conditions, I felt. And we just took it day by day -- trying to hydrate as much [as possible], quarantined off.\"\n\nLyles, beaming with pride at his performance, said he never considered skipping the 200-meter final. The 4x100 meter relay, however, is another story. The 100-meter gold medalist initially told NBC \"I don't know\" when asked if he will compete in the relay, but then added that he was \"feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\"\n\nAs with all things COVID, a conspiracy theory emerged almost immediately in the replies to the BBC's social media post announcing the diagnosis. It also doesn't help that Lyles is a lightning rod of online anger because of his outgoing personality, and his infamous \"world champion of what?\" comment after the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\n\"Don't look like he had covid there,\" wrote one Twitter user who posted a video of Lyles jumping around during his pre-race entrance, not realizing there's a difference between jumping for joy and racing against the fastest men on the planet.\n\nWhile it's not clear exactly how Lyles' diagnosis went unknown for two days -- or why the International Olympic Committee or USA Track & Field allowed an asthmatic to race with COVID and expose others to the virus -- it's probably safe to say it's not an elaborate ruse to justify him standing a little lower than expected on the Olympic podium.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Francisco Gate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabe_fernandez@sfgate.com", "name": "Gabe Fernandez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/34/56/25545661/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

He bested Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by 0.005 seconds in a photo finish to earn \"The Fastest Man in the World\" title and achieve one of his biggest Olympic dreams.\n\nNext up, Lyles will aim for another, as he seeks a gold medal in the 200m race.\n\nThe 200-meter dash may be Lyles' best event. The sprinter has top-tier short-distance speed, but his ability to continue accelerating beyond the first 100 meters makes him an ideal fit for the slightly longer 200-meter race.\n\nIf Lyles can capitalize on his success in the event and win gold during the final, he will write himself into the USA record books. Why? Because he would be one of the only United States runners to ever win \"the double.\"\n\nHere's what to know about \"the double\" and the exclusive list of American men who have earned the world's top honors on the track.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nFull Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters\n\nThe double in track occurs when a runner wins the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes at the same Olympics.\n\nLyles has long established his goal is to earn as many medals as possible at the 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"We're coming after everything,\" Lyles said in February, per NBCOlympics.com. \"All the Olympic medals. I don't care who wants it. It's mine.\"\n\nEven so, the 27-year-old stp knows that winning the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes won't come easily.\n\n\"It's hard to do it once,\" Lyles said of winning a gold medal, per NBC. \"It's incredibly hard to do it twice. If I can do it three times, even four, we're talking about legacy no one would be able to touch, to forever be cemented as a great athlete.\"\n\nLyles has already accomplished half of his goal by winning the 100-meter dash. Now, fans will wait and see if he can show similarly great speed in the 200-meter race, which Lyles has referred to as his \"baby.\"\n\nIf he can win, Lyles would become the first American man to win the Olympic double since 1984.\n\nMORE: How Noah Lyles overcame anxiety, depression to become Olympic gold medalist\n\nCarl Lewis was the last American man to win the double. He did so at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, blazing a 9.99-second 100-meter dash to defeat silver medalist Sam Graddy, who finished 0.2 seconds behind him.\n\nLewis earned four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games: one in the 100-meter dash, one in the 200-meter dash, one in the 4x400 relay and one from the long jump. He has 10 Olympic medals to his name, including nine gold.\n\nThat makes Lewis one of the most decorated male track stars in the Olympics' century-long history. He's tied with Finland's Paavo Nurmi with the most Olympic gold medals for a male track athlete with nine and trails the Fin by just two medals in the total count overall.\n\nIn total, nine different sprinters have won the double at the Olympics. Only one athlete has achieved the feat since Lewis in 1984. That would be Usain Bolt, the only sprinter to win the event more than once.\n\nBelow is a full breakdown of the Olympic double winners, which dates back to Archie Hahn's two race wins in the 1904 Olympics.\n\nIf Lyles can achieve the double, he will cement himself as one of Team USA's most successful sprinters of all time.\n\nHe may also have a chance to tie the mark for the most gold medals won by a track athlete at a single Olympics, a record that is currently shared by several top USA stars like Lewis and Jesse Owens.\n\nBEST U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\nTop 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens\n\nBelow is a full look at Lyles' schedule of events at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nAnd below is a look at Lyles' results in each event:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Graddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Graddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Hahn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archie Hahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paavo_Nurmi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paavo Nurmi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/Noah%20Lyles%20080824.jpg?itok=x0vd-3DU", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I've run with worse conditions, I felt.\"\n\nLyles said he was proud of his performance, despite having Covid.\n\n\"We just took it day-by-day trying to hydrate as much, quarantined off. I definitely say that it's taken its toll for sure,\" he said, \"but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal where last Olympics I was very disappointed, and this time, I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nThe news of Lyles' positive test came not long after he suffered a stunning defeat in the men's 200-meter race, his signature event. Lyles finished in third, unable to overcome Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and his Team USA compatriot Kenneth Bednarek, who finished in first and second place, respectively.\n\nHowever, the result of the race was quickly bumped from the headlines when Lyles laid down on the track immediately following his crossing the finish line. He was helped off the track by medical personnel in a wheelchair and taken to the medical holding area.\n\n\"I've had better days, but I'm walking around again,\" Lyles told reporters afterward. \"I was quite light-headed after that race. Shortness of breath, chest pain, but after a while, I could catch my breath and get my wits about me. I'm a lot better now.\"\n\nIt's a truly shocking turn of events for Lyles, who was hoping to win at least three gold medals at these Olympics. He took the 100-meter race on Sunday by the thinnest of margins and expressed nothing but confidence in his ability to deliver in the 200m and later on in the team relay.\n\nHe appeared to be full of his usual energy when he made his entrance for the race, bounding out of the tunnel to pump up the crowd and jumping around the track.\n\n\"I already had a bunch of energy. This is by far the best day I've felt out of the last three days. Still not 100%, but closer to 90 to 95%. That only works for one shot. I got to settle down for a while. It's one and done, there's no holding back.\"\n\nHe said that he felt like the infection affected his performance, saying, \"I've had to take a lot of breaks. ... I was coughing through the night. I'm more proud of myself than anything, coming out here to get a bronze with Covid.\"\n\nKate Hartman, the chief external affairs officer for the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said in a statement that the group supports Lyles' decision to compete.\n\nAfter Lyles' positive test, she said, \"The USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nLyles told reporters that few people were aware of his diagnosis.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this close to the chest. The people who knew were the medical staff, coach, my mom,\" he said. \"We didn't want everybody going into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete. We wanted to make this as free as possible. I'm competitive. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nHe added that it is unclear if he'll participate as planned in the men's 4x100m on Saturday.\n\n\"We haven't decided yet, I'm going to talk to the 4x100m crew,\" he said. \"I'm going to be very honest and transparent with the coaches, and I'll let them make the decision. No matter what happens, this 4x100m team can handle everything. I've been with them in practice, I know they can come out with a win, break as many records as they put their mind to.\"\n\nCovid-19 has still made its unfortunate presence known at these Paris Games as Lyles is far from the only athlete to test positive for the virus during the Olympics.\n\nFive players on Australia's women's water polo team and Team GB swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nAlthough the world is no longer under a public health emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Olympic Games come as a wave of Covid-19 infections has hit the United States; even President Joe Biden recently tested positive for the disease.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that, if you test positive for Covid-19, you stay home until you are fever-free without the help of fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours and your symptoms have been improving for 24 hours.

Later, wearing a mask, Lyles told reporters he had COVID but decided to compete anyway.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed on the ground trying to catch his breath. He got to one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely was an effect,\" Lyles said. \"But I mean, to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything for coming out and getting the bronze medal with COVID.\"\n\nLyles said he tested positive early Tuesday morning and quickly got into quarantine.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" he said. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWaterloo residents have more than 1,000 signatures on petition to put high school plan on the ballot Teen charged in vape purchase gone wrong after attacking store clerk Man charged after trade-in vehicle in truck sale repossessed Downtown Waterloo bridges opening delayed until fall, no pedestrian use until 2025 Autistic man accused of breaking into co-worker's home to plant letter, smear boyfriend Pablo's Mexican Grill marking 20 years on Main Street in downtown Cedar Falls Clear Lake teen dies in two-vehicle crash Monday afternoon Man sentenced to prison in shooting that paralyzed robbery victim Lawsuit by man paralyzed in Waterloo officer-involved shooting thrown out Waterloo cleaning woman sentenced to probation for burglary, forgery Group effort: Cedar Valley Woodworkers build 17-foot desk for Waterloo library 2024 Courier Male Athlete of the Year: Jesup's Jack Miller Helicopter crashed near Nashua after striking powerlines, killing pilot Cedar Falls City Council to consider items related to more planned roundabouts STEVE CORBIN: Economists say Trump poses a threat to US economy\n\nThe U.S. track federation released a statement saying it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" the statement said. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nThe men's 4x100 relay is set for Friday, and Lyles was expected to run the anchor leg in what many thought would be a quest for a third gold medal in Paris. He said he would talk to his teammates and come to a decision.\n\n\"I want to be very honest and transparent, and I'm going to let them make the decision,\" Lyles said, describing himself as being at around 90 or 95%.\n\nIn the 200, Tebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine.\n\nIt became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nMore gold\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters on her fourth jump to capture the gold medal and join the likes of Tiana Bartoletta, Brittney Reese and the great Jackie Joyner-Kersee as Americans to win that event.\n\nGrant Holloway of the U.S. cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.

And shortly after that, he was also seen being wheeled out in a wheelchair with Olympic medical staff surrounding him.\n\nAs it turns out, Lyles has COVID.\n\nThat certainly throws quite a wrench into things. Here's everything we know about the track star's diagnoses so far.\n\nYes, apparently so. He was diagnosed with COVID two days ago. He confirmed his diagnosis with reporters after the race.\n\nHe said he kept it \"close to the vest\" and didn't want competitors to know he was ill. The signs were there. Lyles had been wearing a mask and quarantining leading up to the race.\n\nTechnically, there is no COVID protocol for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Athletes are not being barred from competing if they get the virus.\n\nChief medical officer of the Olympics, Jon Finnoff, said Team USA is following the CDC guidelines for all infectious disease protocols, USA Today's Carrie McDonald reports.\n\nLyles isn't the only athlete at the Games with COVID. At least 40 athletes have tested positive so far, according to Yahoo! Sports.\n\nHe definitely didn't look it after the race. He immediately fell to the ground after the race and then was put in a wheelchair after.\n\nHe addressed the media after, but the immediate aftermath of the race was certainly concerning.\n\nThe answer is probably not at this point. Lyles said after the race that he's leaning toward not participating.\n\n\"At the moment I don't know. I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing.

He came out two hours later and electrified the crowd by winning the most competitive men's 100m in Olympic history.\n\nIMAGE: Noah Lyles reacts after finishing behind Letsile Tebogo in second place.

I've run with worse conditions, I felt ... \" he said. \"I'd definitely say it's taken its toll, for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get a bronze medal.

It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart,\" Lyles wrote in an Instagram post.\n\n\"I hope everyone enjoyed the show.

He received medical treatment after crossing the line and after the race, U.S. officials said he had COVID, putting his participation in Friday's sprint relay final in serious doubt.\n\nAdding to the chaos, a yellow card appeared against his name in the official results to mark a misconduct violation for damaging his lane box.\n\nLyles might still hog the limelight, but it was Tebogo and Africa's night. It is common to see a clutch of Africans in major middle and long-distance races, but this was the first time in Olympic history that four appeared in a sprint final.\n\nAlthough three filled the last three places in the final, Tebogo\u00b4s place on top of the podium was a huge leap forward.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of - it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew when the gun went Kenny was going to run away so make sure just to close him down, I have that top end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"\n\n(Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "50 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 187}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Instead of Lyles reeling in the runner two lanes to his right, Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, Tebogo pulled farther way. The American favorite, who had gone three years without losing in the 200, labored into the finish and ended up in third.\n\nThe insidious specter of COVID, the killer virus that upended the globe four years ago and made the last Olympics part of its collateral damage, struck at the Paris Games, too.\n\nIn a bracing reminder that the virus is still very much a factor, even if its deadly fingerprint has been blunted, the world's marquee sprinter racing on the world's biggest sports stage revealed he had tested positive two days before his shocking, but now not-inexplicable, bronze-medal finish in the 200.\n\n\"I still wanted to run,\" Lyles said, wearing a mask, as he spoke to reporters, whose mere congregation in a jam-packed scrum underneath the stadium was unthinkable three years ago. \"They said it was possible.\"\n\nWith the blessing of officials at USA Track and Field and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, who said they followed protocol, Lyles did run.\n\nHe finished in 19.70 -- .39 off his personal-best, and .24 behind the 21-year-old Tebogo. Lyles' U.S. teammate Kenny Bednarek finished second, marking the second straight Olympics in which he and Lyles finished 2-3.\n\n\"When I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far, far away behind us,\" Tebogo said. \"So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\"\n\nIt was Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone vs her own world record\n\nAn hour after that shock, Americans Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone lowered her world record for the sixth time, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 50.37 seconds for another Olympic blowout.\n\nThat was one of three gold medals and eight overall the U.S. won on a night filled with big events.\n\nTara Davis-Woodhall jumped 7.10 meters to capture the long jump and get in the Olympic win column next to some greats, including Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Brittney Reese.\n\nGrant Holloway cruised to gold in the 110 hurdles, claiming the Olympic title that eluded him three years ago in his only major-championship loss.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nSprinter Noah Lyles revealed he had COVID-19 after missing out on another gold medal for the United States at the Paris Olympics on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, French basketball star Victor Wembanyama moved closer to his dream of a first gold after helping Les Bleus beat Germany to set up a dream final against the U.S. team after the Americans edged Serbia 95-91.\n\nOn the same Stade de France track where he won the historically close 100 meters by five thousandths of a second, Lyles was third behind gold medalist Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and U.S. teammate Kenneth Bednarek.\n\nMedics tended to a tired-looking Lyles and took him off in a wheelchair. Wearing a mask as he spoke with reporters, Lyles later said he had COVID.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" said Lyles, adding that he tested positive early Tuesday morning but was cleared to compete. The U.S. track federation said it and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee adhered to all Olympic and Centers for Disease Control guidelines.\n\nOver at Bercy Arena, with former NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Tony Parker watching their respective countrymen, France held on to win 73-69.\n\nWembanyama, the NBA rookie of the year, clenched his fists at the buzzer and teammate Evan Fournier jubilantly threw the ball into the crowd.\n\nThe 20-year-old star didn't play three years ago in Tokyo, when the French lost the final to the U.S. They meet again Saturday, when Wembanyama hopes to give France its first Olympic gold in men's or women's basketball.\n\nHighlights of what happened on Day 13 of the Paris Olympics:\n\nCurry leads semifinal fightback against Serbia\n\nThey scored six points in two seconds. And just like that, against what looked like overwhelming odds, the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team was on its way.\n\nTo a comeback. To a win. And to another Olympic gold medal game.\n\nStephen Curry scored 36 points, including a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:16 left, and the U.S. will play for gold in the Paris Olympics on Saturday night after beating Serbia 95-91. LeBron James had the fourth triple-double in Olympic history for the U.S., which trailed by 17 points in the first half and faced an 11-point halftime deficit -- the biggest one successfully overcome by an American team since NBA players were added to the Olympic mix in 1992.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of Team USA basketball,\" Curry said. \"And that was a special one.\"\n\nSerbia led by 11 with 7:19 left. The rest of the way, it was all U.S. The Americans won a game where they led for 3 minutes, 25 seconds. Serbia led for 35:12 -- nearly 90% of the game.\n\nBut it'll be the U.S. against host France for gold in a dream matchup for the host nation on Saturday, while Serbia will face Germany earlier Saturday for bronze. The gold-medal game is a rematch from the Tokyo Games three years ago, where the Americans prevailed 87-82.\n\n\"I'm really humbled to have been a part of this game,\" U.S. coach Steve Kerr said, tipping his hat multiple times to Serbia. \"It's one of the greatest basketball games I've ever been a part of. They were perfect. They played a perfect game. Our coaches were saying, Villanova-Georgetown, for all of our older readers and viewers out there.\n\n\"But they played the perfect game, and they forced us to reach the highest level of competition that we could find. And our guys were incredible in that fourth quarter, and they got it done.\"\n\nJoel Embiid scored 19 points on 8 for 11 shooting and James added 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for the U.S., which is now assured of its 20th medal in 20 Olympic appearances.\n\n\"Joel was everything,\" said James, who has two of the four triple-doubles in Olympic men's history; he also had one in 2012, while the Soviet Union's Aleksander Belov in 1976 and Slovenia's Luka Doncic in 2021 had the others. \"Made every big shot.\"\n\nBogdan Bogdanovic scored 20 points for Serbia, which got 17 from Nikola Jokic and 15 from Aleksa Avramovic. The Serbians were 0-3 against the U.S. this summer, getting blown out in the first two meetings and then looking poised for a win of their own on Thursday.\n\nThe whole game changed in the fourth after a wild sequence saw the U.S. score six points in two seconds. Kevin Durant made a 3-pointer while Anthony Davis was getting fouled. The U.S. got another possession, and off the inbounds Devin Booker made another 3-pointer.\n\nJust like that, a 78-67 lead for Serbia was down to 78-73. The comeback was on, and Curry's 3 put the U.S. up for good. He added a pair of free throws with 8.2 seconds left to make it a two-possession game and the Americans escaped.\n\nCurry's 36 points were the second-most in a game by a U.S. men's player in Olympic history, one shy of Carmelo Anthony's record 37 against Nigeria in 2012. And Anthony, sitting courtside, was Curry's biggest cheerleader. When the Americans tied it with about 3:35 left, Curry gave Anthony a big smile. When the go-ahead 3 rattled home, Anthony leaped from his seat. And when it was over, the two shared a long embrace.\n\n\"That was a godlike performance,\" Durant said of Curry.\n\nSerbia coach Svetislav Petic kept saying the same thing all summer, that the team the U.S. put together for the Paris Games was better than any in Olympic history. Even the Dream Team, he insisted. His mind wasn't changed after this one.\n\n\"They're that good,\" he said.\n\nA barrage of Serbian 3-pointers had the Americans squarely on the ropes, until the game changed in the fourth. But in the end, the U.S. improved to 144-6 all-time in Olympic play, 63-4 since NBA players were added to the Olympics in 1992.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Perseverance, hard work dedication, Chef Curry and Joel 'Process' Embiid,\" James said. \"Big-time win for us. We knew we were going to be challenged. We knew it was going to be the toughest game to date. Total effort.\"\n\nThe comeback kept Durant's hopes of becoming the first four-time Olympic men's gold medalist very much alive, and gave the U.S. a chance to return to the international basketball mountaintop. The Americans were fourth at the World Cup last summer, a result that spurred some NBA stars like James and Curry to be part of this team.\n\nAnd of all the U.S. semifinal moments, this was like few others. The four-point final margin was the second closest in American history in the Olympic semifinals; the U.S. beat Lithuania by two in the 2000 semifinals in Sydney, on the way to gold there.\n\nThey're one win away from another.\n\n\"I'm 39 years old, going into my 22nd season, I don't know how many opportunities and moments I'm going to get like this to compete for something, compete for something big and play in big games,\" James said. \"And tonight was a big game.\"\n\nUS team gets a world record, breaks the 100-medal mark\n\nThe United States now has more golds and more overall medals than any other nation.\n\nWith three days left of competition, American athletes total 30 golds for 103 medals overall.\n\nThe U.S. went 1-2 in the women's 400 hurdles with Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone breaking her own world record in a time of 50.37 seconds, and Anna Cockrell taking the silver.\n\nGrant Holloway followed up with gold in the men's 110 hurdles in 12.99, beating countryman Daniel Roberts.\n\nAlso, Long jumper Tara Davis-Woodhall won the women's long jump with Jasmine Moore taking the bronze behind Germany's Malaika Mihambo.\n\nChina's diving double ends with tears\n\nChina claimed its sixth gold medal in diving at the Paris Games with defending champion Xie Siyi winning the 3-meter springboard.\n\nThe Chinese made it a podium 1-2 as Wang Zongyuan took the silver ahead of Mexico's Osmar Olvera Ibarra.\n\nWang was in tears afterward.\n\nHe hadn't lost a major diving competition in the event since finishing behind teammate Xie at the Tokyo Olympics. After that silver, Wang won three straight world championship titles.\n\n\"It is regrettable I lost,\" Wang said through an interpreter. \"I must learn to accept any failure and my response is to make a greater effort to improve myself.\"\n\nAnother world record but no gold\n\nAmerican Sam Watson left the Games with another world record to his name but didn't get the gold medal.\n\nThe 18-year-old Watson broke sport climbing's speed world record on Thursday for the second time at the Paris Games, but that came in the fight for bronze.\n\nVeddriq Leonardo of Indonesia won gold in 4.75 seconds in the final.\n\nCharron lifts for another medal\n\nMaude Charron raised Canada's flag at the opening ceremony for the Paris Games and lifted up another medal in weightlifting.\n\nCharron took the silver medal in the 59-kilogram category to add to her gold in the 64-kilogram competition at the Tokyo Games.\n\nRahimi stars as Morocco gets bronze\n\nSoccer-mad Morocco fans finally have an Olympic medal to celebrate after routing African rival Egypt 6-0 for the bronze.\n\nSoufiane Rahimi scored twice and the Casablanca-born striker will surely become a household name back home after netting an impressive eight goals in the tournament.\n\nHe was comfortably the leading scorer ahead of Friday's final between Spain and 1984 Olympic champion France.\n\nMorocco won the African Cup of Nations title in 1976.\n\nDutch end long wait for gold in men's field hockey\n\nDuco Telgenkamp scored the golden goal in the shootout to give the Netherlands a 2-1 victory over Germany.\n\nIt was the Netherlands' first gold in men's hockey at the Olympics since 2000 and third in the country's history.\n\nCaptain Harmanpreet Singh scored both goals as India beat Spain 2-1 for a second straight bronze, after beating Germany at the Tokyo Games.\n\nFrench get gold, Portugal a rare medal\n\nTrack cyclist Benjamin Thomas overcame a crash in the men's omnium race to give France its 14th gold medal of the Paris Games.\n\nThomas held off I\u00fari Leit\u00e3o, whose silver medal was only Portugal's second medal so far -- compared to 54 for the French.\n\nAlso, world champion Ellesse Andrews of New Zealand won the Olympic title in the women's keirin.\n\nNadeem gets Pakistan's first medal with an Olympic record\n\nArshad Nadeem got Pakistan's first medal of the Paris Games in style by setting an Olympic record in javelin.\n\nNadeem's throw of 92.97 meters beat Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen's mark of 90.57 from the 2008 Games in Beijing.\n\nPlain sailing for Austria\n\nIn the southern port city of Marseille, Lara Vadlau and Lukas Maehr of Austria won gold in a tight race in the mixed-gender dinghy.\n\nThe sport became a new sailing category at these Games.\n\nAP Olympics:

The 27-year-old Lyles had to work hard to finish second in 20.08.\n\nAmericans Kenny Bednarek, Olympic silver medallist in Tokyo, and Erriyon Knighton each won their semi-finals, Bednarek clocking 20.00 and the 20-year-old Knighton crossing in 20.09.\n\nRounding out the field for Thursday's final are Alexander Ogando of the Dominican Republic, Joseph Fahnbulleh of Liberia, and Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu and Makanakaishe Charamba.\n\nLyles, the three-time reigning world champion over what has always been his stronger event, has not lost over the distance since he had to settle for bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHis run on Wednesday, however, was reminiscent of his sluggish 100m semi-final after which he reached out to his therapist for guidance. He came out two hours later and electrified the crowd by winning the most competitive men's 100m in Olympic history.\n\nLyles is looking to become the first American in four decades to win the Olympic sprint double. He is aiming for potentially four golds in Paris, in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay, and -- if he is selected in the squad -- the 4x400m relay.\n\nCanada's defending champion Andre de Grasse, the last man to beat Lyles in a competitive race over the distance, did not advance to the final.

It was a dominant race from the 100m world silver medalist, who took charge of the race as soon as they came around the bend.\n\nA steady run saw him hold off America's Kenny Bednarek, who was second with a time of 19.62. Lyles could only manage a third-place finish, crossing the line with 19.70 seconds.\n\nAfter the race, Tebogo held up his boot to show the year his mother was born.\n\nTebogo's mother was an influential figure in her son's career. She was spotted in various track meets, most notably at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, last year.\n\nHe took silver in the men's 100m before winning bronze in the men's 200m in Hungary.\n\n\"To say that I am happy is an understatement. I am so proud of his achievements and putting Africa on the map,\" his mother said then.\n\nThe win is now a relief for Tebogo, who failed to shine in the 100m.

Lyles previously won bronze in the 200-meter final in Tokyo in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyree_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyree King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/mvTeksNHFSmoT6iPCbqCtKrXIZw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(937x476:939x478)/Noah-Lyles-2024-olympics-tout-080824-6a11d9a22a6e44f180460530e2d2fd1c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 84, "textEnd": 90}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 920, "textEnd": 926}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1320, "textEnd": 1326}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1953, "textEnd": 1959}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

I've run with worse conditions, I felt.\"\n\nLyles said he was proud of his performance, despite having Covid.\n\n\"We just took it day-by-day trying to hydrate as much, quarantined off. I definitely say that it's taken its toll for sure,\" he said, \"but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal where last Olympics I was very disappointed, and this time, I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nThe news of Lyles' positive test came not long after he suffered a stunning defeat in the men's 200-meter race, his signature event. Lyles finished in third, unable to overcome Botswana's Letsile Tebogo and his Team USA compatriot Kenneth Bednarek, who finished in first and second place, respectively.\n\nHowever, the result of the race was quickly bumped from the headlines when Lyles laid down on the track immediately following his crossing the finish line. He was helped off the track by medical personnel in a wheelchair and taken to the medical holding area.\n\nIt's a truly shocking turn of events for Lyles, who was hoping to win at least three gold medals at these Olympics. He took the 100-meter race on Sunday by the thinnest of margins and expressed nothing but confidence in his ability to deliver in the 200m and later on in the team relay.\n\nKate Hartman, the chief external affairs officer for the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said in a statement that the group supports Lyles' decision to compete.\n\nAfter Lyles' positive test, she said, \"The USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nCovid-19 has still made its unfortunate presence known at these Paris Games as Lyles is far from the only athlete to test positive for the virus during the Olympics.\n\nFive players on Australia's women's water polo team and Team GB swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nAlthough the world is no longer under a public health emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Olympic Games come as a wave of Covid-19 infections has hit the United States; even President Joe Biden recently tested positive for the disease.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that, if you test positive for Covid-19, you stay home until you are fever-free without the help of fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours and your symptoms have been improving for 24 hours. It then recommends wearing a mask around other people for the next five days.\n\nSeparate public health guidance for travelers attending the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games was released last week by the World Health Organization, the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, Sant\u00e9 publique France and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nThe guidance recommends checking your vaccination status against common infectious diseases including measles, whooping cough, polio and Covid-19.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The American sprinter, who excels in the 200m, remains unbeaten in 25 races over this distance since earning bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Lyles has also secured the last three world titles in the event.\n\nLyles aims to achieve an ambitious goal of winning four gold medals in Paris, targeting the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay, and possibly the 4x400m relay. Such a feat would place him alongside legendary compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who each won four golds in a single Games, though their fourth medals came in the long jump rather than the longer relay.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: India Schedule | Full Coverage | Medal Tally\n\n\"It feels good to be out here,\" Lyles told reporters. \"It was in my head win the 120, win the 150, check around, win the heat.\"\n\nDefending champion Andre de Grasse of Canada, the last sprinter to beat Lyles, followed closely behind, finishing in 20.30 seconds. American Kenny Bednarek, who secured silver ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and was runner-up to him at the 2022 World Championships, posted the fastest time of the heats with 19.96 seconds despite easing up before the finish. Bednarek also competed in Sunday's 100m final, where his time of 9.88 seconds placed him seventh.\n\nErriyon Knighton, who has previously won world championship silver and bronze medals as a teenager, ensured a strong American presence in the semi-finals by winning his heat in 19.99 seconds, the only other sub-20 time of the evening. Now 20, Knighton is eager to make his mark on the Olympic stage after years of being touted as the next big star.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo, who set a national record of 9.86 seconds while finishing sixth in Sunday's 100m final and claimed bronze in the 200m at last year's World Championships, comfortably won his heat in 20.10 seconds. Wayde van Niekerk, the 400m world record holder and former world championship silver medallist in the 200m, advanced as the third automatic qualifier from the first heat with a time of 20.42 seconds, having chosen to skip the 400m event in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayde_van_Niekerk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayde van Niekerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/paris-olympics-2024-063012947-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=.A2Vvglhj3nE7kkf96TRNBujiGvXE8Qb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He left the arena in a wheelchair and received medical attention before returning the track and speaking with reporters.\n\nAccording to Lyles' mother, he was diagnosed with COVID on Tuesday, Aug. 6.\n\nNBC Olympics' Lewis Johnson reported on the track broadcast that Lyles' mother confirmed the COVID diagnosis.\n\n\"I ran into his mom Keisha Caine Bishop who was distraught trying to find him as well,\" Johnson said. \"We found Noah Lyles in medical, they're being tended to and she did confirm that Noah had been diagnosed with COVID two days ago.\"\n\nSeveral minutes later, Lyles spoke to Johnson during his broadcast.\n\n\"Yeah, I woke up early, about 5 a.m. on Tuesday morning and I just was feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than just being sore from the [100m race]. Woke up the doctor's, and we tested, and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for COVID. My first thought was not to panic, thinking, 'I've been in worse situations, I've run with worse conditions,'\" he said.\n\nLyles previously said he has asthma, which the CDC has said can put people \"at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.\n\nWhile it is still to be determined if he'll return to the competition, Lyles is slated to run in the men's 4x100m relay race on Friday.\n\nSo far, at least 40 athletes have tested positive for COVID at the Paris Olympics, according to a report from the TODAY Show.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee told TODAY.com that it has the following protocols in place to reduce the risk of COVID among Team USA athletes:\n\n\"We implemented an infection prevention program prior to the Games ('Don't let a cold keep you from the gold') that encouraged athletes to wash their hands, wear face masks when indoors during their travel from the US to Paris, etc.\n\n\"If they have an infectious disease, we will set them up with the indicated treatment/medications, and provide them with a private room so they don't have to worry about getting their roommate sick.\n\n\"We will help with transportation so they aren't in a bus with other athletes, and we will deliver their meals.\n\n\"We will have them wear a mask anytime they are inside and around other people.\n\n\"We will allow them to train and compete as long as they feel up to it.\"\n\nThe CDC issued the following statement on its website regarding the 2024 Olympics:\n\n\"Mass gatherings are associated with unique health risks, including an increased risk for respiratory illnesses. If you plan to travel to Paris for these events, make sure you are up to date on routine and recommended vaccines, including for COVID-19.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2165914878.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 653, "textEnd": 659}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

NBC said they spoke to Lyles' mom, who confirmed he had the virus before the athlete himself spoke out. He said he had no regrets over competing, despite the inevitable risk of spreading the virus to other athletes, who he hugged and shook hands with after the race.\n\nThe USA star told NBC, masked up: 'I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've ben in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions. 'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.' He was asked by Lewis Johnson if he considered withdrawing and gave an emphatic response: 'No. No. We just said we were going to quarantine as much as possible and not try and pass it on.'\n\nLyles did admit the virus could force him out of USA's 4x100m relay on Friday. 'At the moment I don't know, I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,' he said. 'They have proven they can handle it without me.' Michael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to go ahead and compete, saying on the BBC: 'Very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It is just bizarre, the whole thing is really weird. 'There is going to be all of this thing with the Noah haters out there - and he set himself up for it - there are going to be people out there saying it's not real and he's faking or whatever.\n\n'But putting that aside, having Covid and still coming out here and being in close proximity with other people - I know there probably is not a policy I guess at these Games for that - but morally I'm not sure about it.' There are no rules that force athletes to withdraw from events, with all Covid protocols dropped for the Paris Games. Moments earlier, NBC's Johnson revealed Lyles' condition: 'We saw Noah being taken off there in a wheelchair. I ran into his mom who was distraught.'\n\n'She did confirm that Noah had been diagnosed with Covid two days ago but he decided he was going to run anyway. 'I ran down underneath the stadium to try and find where he was. We found Noah Lyles in medical being tended to. 'Obviously what he has there may have affected how he performed. He is now with medical people but that is the issue. Noah has Covid.'\n\nThe USA star made his trademark theatrical entrance to the race, leaping into the stadium as his name was announced and screaming at the crowd for the race that many had him as the big favorite for.\n\nBut after being left behind by Letsile Tebogo, who won gold, and fellow American Kenny Bednarek, Lyles was seen strewn on the track and struggling for breath after congratulating his fellow competitors. Moments later, he was pictured needing a wheelchair to make his way off the track. He arrived for the race wearing a mask.\n\nLyles tweeted earlier this week - after winning gold in 100m - that he is asthmatic, saying: 'I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. 'But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!' He also took to X to offer Tebogo his congratulations on winning gold, saying: 'LETSILE TEBOGO congratulations. Ik (I know) you have had a very rough year off the track and despite that you overcame it all!'\n\nLyles was seen shaking hands and hugging his fellow competitors before he dropped to the ground. Earlier this week, it was reported that over 40 athletes had tested positive for the virus. British swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive a day after winning silver in the 100m breaststroke when he had not felt well, his team said.

Lyles, who won the 100m in a photo-finish from Jamaican Kishane Thompson in 9.79 seconds, topped his 200m heat in 20.19sec. The triple world 200m champion had a slow start but as soon as he hit the bend he looked in total control. The semi-finals are scheduled for 1802 GMT on Wednesday, with the final set for 1830 on Thursday.\n\n\"I was up by seven. My dang body got this clock that wakes up at seven because that's when I practise every day,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"So that's when I naturally wake up. But throughout the day it's kind of just been meandering, trying to get my body jump-started.\n\n\"I saw my physio and chiro at about 10, saw them till 12. Then I got some food, took a nap and woke up about 3.30. And here we are.\"\n\nLyles, who will also chase gold in the 4x100m relay, said the 200m remained his \"favourite race because I feel it shows all my abilities\".\n\n\"I spent years working on the 100m, but the 200 is where it's at. This is where I get to show my speed and endurance and my top-end speed.\n\n\"This is where I get to show I'm stronger than everybody else.\"\n\nLyles' Jamaican partner Junelle Bromfield qualified for the semi-finals of the women's 400m, on the couple's two-year anniversary.\n\n\"I watched it on TV while I was getting treatment,\" Lyles said of Bromfield, who was a one-time training partner of Thompson, who was edged into 100m silver on Sunday by just five-thousandths of a second.\n\nHe added: \"We've been dating for two years now - it goes by fast. I've got pretty big plans for celebrations. I'm trying to give her a little more time.\n\n\"Last year we kind of went on a Noah Lyles campaign and unfortunately that cut into a lot of our vacation time.\"\n\nAlso going through into the 200m semis as heat winners were fellow 100m finalists Letsile Tebogo of Botswana (20.10sec) and American Kenny Bednarek (19.96).\n\nTebogo finished sixth in the 100m in a national record of 9.86sec, one ahead of Bednarek, and the Botswanan admitted it had been something he had had to \"digest quickly and live for another day\".\n\n\"It doesn't mean it's the end of the world even if you didn't make it in the 100m,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people didn't make it in the final, so I was grateful that I made it into the final.\"\n\nThe 200m, he argued, was a more sympathetic event than the 100m.\n\n\"The 100m is more of a tactical race. You have to get everything correct from the block, to your running, even timing your dip.

The Team USA star will compete in the men's 200m final on Thursday, aiming for a rare sprint double after his thrilling victory in the 100m final on Sunday. The 27-year-old Lyles won his first Olympic gold medal and secured Team USA's first 100m title in two decades with a late surge that clinched the race by a narrow margin.\n\nHaving already earned the title of \"Fastest Man in the World\" at the Paris Games, Lyles stands on the brink of joining an elite group in Olympic history:\n\nThe men's sprint double -- where an athlete wins both the 100m and 200m dashes at the same Games -- has been achieved 11 times by nine athletes throughout Olympic history.\n\nThe last athlete to complete the sprint double was the legendary Usain Bolt, who accomplished this feat at three consecutive Games. The eight-time gold medalist swept the 100m and 200m sprints at the 2008 Beijing Games, the 2012 London Games, and the 2016 Rio Games, making him the only man to achieve the Olympic sprint double multiple times. In 2012, he also became the first athlete -- male or female -- to complete the sprint double at consecutive Games.\n\nFellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson-Herah recently made history as the first woman to win both the 100m and 200m races at consecutive Olympics, achieving this in the 2016 Games and the pandemic-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. She had previously become the first woman to complete the sprint double since American Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Seoul Games.\n\nHere's a look at every men's sprint double in Olympic history, with Carl Lewis' achievement in 1984 being the most recent by an American:\n\nOwens, Morrow, and Lewis, along with Bolt in 2012 and 2016, expanded their sprint doubles into triples by winning the 4x100m relay as well.\n\nThe 200m is considered Lyles' stronger event compared to the 100m. After earning a bronze medal at the Tokyo Games, Lyles remained undefeated in 200m races until the semifinals in Paris, where he placed second in his heat with a time of 20.08 seconds, finishing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo (19.96). Lyles posted the third-best semifinal time overall, behind Tebogo and fellow American Kenny Bednarek (20.00). Bednarek is the reigning Olympic silver medalist, while the defending Olympic champion, Canada's Andre De Grasse, did not qualify for the final.\n\nLyles' personal-best time in the 200m is the American record of 19.31 seconds, achieved at the 2022 World Championships. His season-best time of 19.53 seconds came at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The 27-year-old Lyles had to push to finish second in 20.08.\n\nAmericans Kenny Bednarek, Olympic silver medalist in Tokyo, and Erriyon Knighton each won their semifinals, Bednarek clocking 20.00 and the 20-year-old Knighton crossing in 20.09.\n\nRounding out the field for Thursday's final are Alexander Ogando of the Dominican Republic, Joseph Fahnbulleh of Liberia, and Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu and Makanakaishe Charamba.\n\nLyles, the three-time reigning world champion over what has always been his stronger event, has not lost over the distance since he had to settle for bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHis run on Wednesday, however, was reminiscent of his sluggish 100 semifinal after which he reached out to his therapist for guidance. He came out two hours later and electrified the crowd by winning the most competitive men's 100-meter dash in Olympic history.\n\nLyles did not stop to speak to reporters, heading straight to see medical experts, a USA Track and Field spokesperson said.\n\nHe is looking to become the first American in four decades to win the Olympic sprint double and is aiming for potentially four golds in Paris, in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay, and -- if he is selected in the squad -- the 4x400m relay.\n\nCanada's defending champion Andre de Grasse, the last man to beat Lyles in a competitive race over the distance, did not advance to the final.\n\n\"I reactivated a lingering issue in my hamstring,\" De Grasse said. \"It was going to be tough today. I knew I had to go out there and try to do my best and see what I can come up with.\n\n\"It's tough. It's been a tough 24, 48 hours. I've just got to try to keep the head, try to see how I can support my team in any way with the 4x100m relay.\"", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@star-telegram.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ogando", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Ogando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fahnbulleh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Fahnbulleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/aagaq9/picture290856004/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/1b03a8f0-055d-480a-a0a8-d94ca7f527ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

He said he had no regrets over competing, despite the inevitable risk of spreading the virus to other athletes, who he hugged and shook hands with after the race.\n\nThe USA star told NBC, masked up: 'I woke up early about 5am Tuesday morning, feeling really horrible. I knew it was more than being sore from the 100. My first thought was not to panic, I've ben in worse situations, I've been in worse conditions.\n\n'I took it day by day, tried to hydrate as much. It would say it has taken its toll, for sure, but I have never been more proud of myself coming out here and getting a bronze.'\n\nHe was asked by Lewis Johnson if he considered withdrawing and gave an emphatic response: 'No. No. We just said we were going to quarantine as much as possible and not try and pass it on.'\n\nLyles did admit the virus could force him out of USA's 4x100m relay on Friday.\n\n'At the moment I don't know, I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,' he said. 'They have proven they can handle it without me.'\n\nMoments earlier, NBC's Johnson revealed Lyles' condition: 'We saw Noah being taken off there in a wheelchair. I ran into his mom who was distraught.\n\n'She did confirm that Noah had been diagnosed with Covid two days ago but he decided he was going to run anyway.\n\n'I ran down underneath the stadium to try and find where he was. We found Noah Lyles in medical being tended to.\n\n'Obviously what he has there may have affected how he performed. He is now with medical people but that is the issue. Noah has Covid.'\n\nThe USA star made his trademark theatrical entrance to the race, leaping into the stadium as his name was announced and screaming at the crowd for the race that many had him as the big favorite for.\n\nBut after being left behind by Letsile Tebogo, who won gold, and fellow American Kenny Bednarek, Lyles was seen strewn on the track and struggling for breath after congratulating his fellow competitors.\n\nMoments later, he was pictured needing a wheelchair to make his way off the track. He arrived for the race wearing a mask.\n\nLyles tweeted earlier this week - after winning gold in 100m - that he is asthmatic, saying: 'I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!'\n\nMichael Johnson questioned Lyles' decision to go ahead and compete, saying on the BBC: 'Very bizarre, Covid is still a dangerous disease. It is just bizarre, the whole thing is really weird.\n\n'There is going to be all of this thing with the Noah haters out there - and he set himself up for it - there are going to be people out there saying it's not real and he's faking or whatever.\n\n'But putting that aside, having Covid and still coming out here and being in close proximity with other people - I know there probably is not a policy I guess at these Games for that - but morally I'm not sure about it.'\n\nThere are, however, no rules that force athletes to withdraw from events with all Covid protocols dropped for the Paris Games.\n\nLyles was seen shaking hands and hugging his fellow competitors before he dropped to the ground.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that over 40 athletes had tested positive for the virus.\n\nBritish swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive a day after winning silver in the 100m breaststroke when he had not felt well, his team said.\n\nAustralian medal hope Lani Pallister pulled out of

Lyles quarantined in a hotel near the Olympic Village, tried to get as much rest and fluids as he could and took any medication he could without violating anti-doping rules.\n\nThe idea of not competing in the 200 never was something that Lyles seriously considered, especially after he managed to advance to the final by gutting out a second-place finish in his semifinal heat on Wednesday. Lyles explained that he \"still wanted to run\" and that doctors gave him permission to try.\n\nRight from the start of Thursday's final, it was obvious that the world's most unbeatable 200 runner didn't have his usual burst. The American fell behind early and struggled to make up ground after rounding the turn, leaving himself too far back of Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and fellow American Kenny Bednarek to overtake either of them before they reached the finish line.\n\nhttps://sports.yahoo.com/covid-derails-noah-lyles-bid-for-sprint-double-i-believe-this-will-be-the-end-of-my-2024-olympics-183515628.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The 27-year-old athlete, who remained fully conscious, had to be helped off the track in a wheelchair by medical personnel, and was taken to a medical holding area.\n\nWearing a black medical mask, he told Olympic broadcaster NBC News that he was \"quite lightheaded after that race, and shortness of breath and chest pains were definitely active.\n\n\"But after a while underneath [the stands], I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. So I'm feeling a lot better now.\"\n\nLyles told reporters that he first tested positive after waking up \"feeling horrible\" around 5 a.m. on Tuesday. \"I knew it was more than just being sore from the [100-meter race],\" he said. \"I woke up the doctors and we tested, and unfortunately, it came out that I was positive for COVID.\"\n\nThe runner moved out of Paris' Athletes Village and into a hotel to isolate, taking \"as much medication as we legally could,\" including Paxlovid, under observation by USA Track & Field's medical team.\n\nStill, there was no question that Lyles would compete in the 200-meter, his signature event. On Wednesday, still feeling the effects of the virus, he finished second in his semi-final heat with a time of 20.08. His final time was 19.70, as compared to Tebogo's 19.46 and Bednarek's 19.62.\n\n\"I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go,\" he said. \"I didn't have any time to save energy, so that was kind of the strategy for today,\" he added. \"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I would definitely say I'm closer to like, 90 to 95 percent.\"\n\nThe northern Virginia native did not break any Olympics protocols by competing in the race. While the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics instituted strict rules regarding testing and masking, the 2024 Paris Games allow COVID-positive athletes to compete at their discretion. At least 19 athletes have tested positive over the past two weeks, according to Scientific American.\n\nLyles has been adamant about his intention to compete in the men's 4x100 team relay on Friday night, but added Thursday that he would let his coaches decide.\n\nUSA Track & Field said it supported Lyles' decision to continue competing. After his positive COVID test, a spokesperson said that officials \"swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nPrior to his test, Lyles was having an exceptional Games, clinching the gold medal in Sunday's 100-meter dash, which he ran in 9.79 seconds, a personal best. He finished five-thousandths of a second ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_skiing_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winter Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3132,w_5568,x_0,y_418/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1723149405/GettyImages-2165913395_gkwgmr", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

My dang body got this clock that wakes up at seven because that's when I practise every day,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"So that's when I naturally wake up. But throughout the day it's kind of just been meandering, trying to get my body jump-started.\n\n\"I saw my physio and chiro at about 10, saw them till 12. Then I got some food, took a nap and woke up at about 3.30. And here we are.\"\n\nLyles, who will also chase gold in the 4x100m relay, said the 200m remained his \"favourite race because I feel it shows all my abilities\".\n\n\"I spent years working on the 100m, but the 200 is where it's at. This is where I get to show my speed and endurance and my top-end speed.\n\n\"This is where I get to show I'm stronger than everybody else.\"\n\nLyles' Jamaican partner Junelle Bromfield qualified for the semi-finals of the women's 400m, on the couple's second anniversary.\n\n\"I watched it on TV while I was getting treatment,\" Lyles said of Bromfield, who was a one-time training partner of Thompson, who was edged into 100m silver on Sunday by just five-thousandths of a second.\n\nHe added: \"We've been dating for two years now - it goes by fast. I've got pretty big plans for celebrations.

His second-place finish in the 200-meter semifinals has secured him a spot in Thursday's final, setting the stage for an exciting showdown.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Lyles found himself in the second spot in his semifinal race, trailing behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo. This was a rare occurrence, as it was the first time in three years that he didn't clinch the top spot in a 200-meter race, a streak that started after his third-place finish at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nIt could be a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Lyles at the Paris Games, as he didn't emerge victorious in his 100-meter semifinal round. However, Lyles staged a remarkable comeback, winning the 100-meter race in a thrilling photo finish. His 100-meters victory was secured by a mere 0.005 seconds over Jamaica's Kishane Thompson.\n\nRegardless, a new 200-meter champion will be crowned, as Andre De Grasse of Canada finished third in his heat but did not advance to defend his Tokyo gold medal.\n\nHere is how he fared in the 200 and his day's first race, the 4x100 relay round 1 race.\n\n2024 Paris Olympic Games: Entire schedule with TV, time and streaming for every event\n\nNoah Lyles won gold in the 100-meters and will participate in the 200-meters, 4x100 meters relay and perhaps the 4x400 meters relay in Paris.\n\nEvery event at the 2024 Paris Olympics will air live across one of NBC, USA Network, E! and CNBC, as well as Spanish broadcasts on Universo and Telemundo.

But a loaded schedule that featured a historic run for gold in the 100m on Sunday clearly appeared to take its toll.\n\nQuestions of his health also came into question as he was seen wearing a mask in recent days. Those only strengthened when he went down following the race and was in need of medical attention.\n\nThe 27-year-old Alexandria, VA was attempting to become just the 10th Olympian ever to win the 100m and 200m at the same Games and the first American to do so in 40 years.\n\nBut it never looked as though he was going to challenge for gold, especially considering he had the slowest reaction time off the blocks (0.173 seconds) amongst the field of eight runners.\n\nFrom Lane 5, he managed to make up the slow start and get into third, but could not catch Bednarek, who ran a 19.62-second race, and Tebogo, who set an African record of 19.46 seconds.\n\nLyles took the mantle of fastest man alive on Sunday when he narrowly defeated Jamaica's Krishane Thompson by a razor-thin 0.005 (five-one-thousandths of a second). To put into perspective just how close of a finish that was, the average human's blink of an eye lasts between 0.1 to 0.4 seconds, per Harvard University.\n\nLyles had finished second in his semifinal qualifying heat on Wednesday to Tebogo (19.96 seconds).

Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nLyles ran his 200m heat on Monday.

I rarely get sick,\" Bednarek said. \"I'm just going to give him a hug, regardless of whether he's sick or not. I don't really care about those things.\"\n\nIt was reported this week that 16 Australian Olympians contracted Covid during the Games. British swimmer Adam Peaty returned a positive test the morning after claiming 100m breaststroke silver.\n\nBednarek nonetheless insisted he was unaware of an athletes' village epidemic.\n\n\"I guess I'm carefree, so I'm not really seeing certain things,\" he said. \"There was a message that came out saying something was going on, but I haven't seen anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com",

Soon after the race concluded, Lyles confirmed that he's been fighting COVID-19 since Tuesday, just days after winning the 100-meter dash on Sunday.\n\nThursday afternoon, hundreds poured into the auditorium at Alexandria City High School, where Lyles graduated in 2016, for a watch party.\n\nThe cheers were nearly deafening as family and friends watched Lyles fly around the track, placing third to Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and teammate Kenny Bednarek.\n\nLyles was so wiped out following his finish that medical personnel had to cart him off the track.\n\nLyle's brother Delano Frazer was in attendance here in Alexandria and couldn't be prouder.\n\n\"Best you can say is I'm proud of him. All the hard work, dedication, effort he has put into it, being the master of his craft right now. I can be nothing but proud of him, in awe of him,\" said Delano Frazer.\n\nLori Hawkins, with the Lyles Brothers Sports Foundation, told 7News On Your Side, \"He is the best of the best.

And, with a staff in hand, pound it three times. It's called Les Trois Coups, meaning three ground strikes, and it's designed to kick off the venue's events with a thunderous rhythm.\n\nThursday, at Stade de France, the honors went to Carl Lewis. It was an homage to Noah Lyles, the 100-meter champion and the world's best at 200 meters. He was on the cusp of a feat not done by an American since Lewis in 1984.\n\nBut what was revealed to Lyles was just how difficult the task is, no matter how easy Jamaican Usain Bolt, the greatest of all time, made it look.\n\nLyles was not only beaten by Botswana's Letsile Tebogo's 19.46 -- the same man who beat him in his semifinal heat. But Lyles was also beaten by teammate Kenny Bednarek's 19.62 -- the same man who Lyles, after his 100-meter win, said would not win.\n\nLyles was humbled. He ran a decent time of 19.70. But he was never really a threat to win it.\n\nAfter all his verbal taunts, after declaring himself a legend in the making and talking about transcending the sport, Lyles mostly backed it up.

After the race, Lyles went straight to the medical area, further fueling speculation about his condition.\n\nLyles did not wear a mask before his 100m final but wore one before the 200m event, sparking speculation about a possible illness. Many fans have expressed their worries on social media, noting that his performance in the semifinal was unusual.\n\nHis decision to wear a mask aligns with other athletes taking extra precautions during the games. Mask-wearing has become common in crowded areas and during travel to reduce infection risk. This practice helps athletes compete without health concerns.\n\nDespite finishing second in the semifinal, Lyles remains a top contender for the gold medal in the 200m race, his stronger event. The men's 200m final is scheduled for Thursday, August 8 at 2:30 p.m. ET. His race time of 20.08 was third-fastest overall among the semifinal heats.\n\nNoah Lyles' proactive approach to health and safety is evident in his use of a mask before the 200m final.

Here's why he's smiling so big in Paris.", "body": "An ironclad rule of sports journalism is that there's no cheering in the press box. Sports journalists are to always exhibit neutrality. We're human, though, and at times it's impossible not to become a fan of individual athletes. And I'll admit that when the men in the 200-meter final settle into their starting blocks Thursday, I'll be in my living room, ready to cheer American Noah Lyles to victory.\n\nAlready the 100-meter gold medalist after a thrilling, photo-finish race Sunday night, Lyles will be running to secure his second gold medal in Paris in the event that put him on the path to track and field greatness.\n\nOn Aug. 4, 2021, in Tokyo, he won a bronze medal in the 200 meters, behind Canada's Andre DeGrasse and American Kenny Bednarek. Lyles' loss was one of the surprises of the meet, perhaps behind only Italy's Marcell Jacobs' shocking the hell out of the world with his 100-meter win. After that race, in the thick humidity of the mix zone under Tokyo Olympic Stadium, I became a fan.\n\nLyles was spent. He was talking to print and online reporters after he'd already endured more than a dozen television and radio interviews. His initial aloofness gave way to a torrent of emotion, his disappointment at not winning. He cried. He apologized for crying. He expressed his sorrow that his younger brother, Josephus, the one he'd followed into track as a kid so they could be together, wasn't in Tokyo competing. \"This should be him,\" he said.\n\nHe shared more about his nearly lifelong journey with anxiety and depression and how the year leading into those Olympics had been the hardest of his life physically and mentally.\n\nA U.S.A. Track & Field media official offered to cut things short. He didn't take the out.\n\n\"Having a place where you can actually be OK with letting go of your fears and saying, 'I am scared,' because I've definitely said that quite a few times this year,\" Lyles said. \"It's OK, you know?\n\n\"I want other people to know that there's a better way.\"\n\nAfter Lyles won the 100-meter race in Paris on Sunday, he posted a message on social media: \"I have Asthma, allergies, dyslexia, ADD, anxiety, and Depression. But I will tell you that what you have does not define what you can become. Why Not You!\"\n\nTalking to us reporters under the stadium in Tokyo three years ago, Lyles was raw and vulnerable, in a way we've rarely seen from those in the public eye, in a way that we, for far too long, have told athletes, particularly male athletes, isn't allowed. Thankfully, led in part by Lyles and gymnastics icon Simone Biles, that stigma seems to be melting away.\n\nIf his tears over not winning the 200 in Tokyo were Lyles' low point, everything since has propelled him higher and higher.\n\nHe has made it his mission to make track and field more popular in the States, in part by making the stadium walk-in photo opportunity, now common in other professional sports, a thing in his sport, too. He's used it as a time to show off some personality and his fashion sense before showing out when the competition begins. With his big talk and his painted nails, he relishes the pre-meet meetings with media, sometimes poking at his competitors and even athletes outside his sport. He got the attention of NBA stars when he said last year at the world championships that it bothers him to hear the NBA's title-winning team called world champions when 29 of the 30 teams are in the U.S. (the 30th is in Canada).\n\nWhile he is raising his own profile and chasing Jamaica's Usain Bolt in the record book, other American track standouts could reap the benefits of the increased exposure.\n\nMore than the walk-in photo-ops and the entertaining news conferences, however, Lyles knew that the real way to make himself a household name was to win what counts as the marquee event at every Olympics and perhaps across all sports: the men's 100-meter gold and the accompanying title of \"world's fastest man.\"\n\nLyles had always included 100-meter races on his schedule (he has called the race his mistress, while the 200 meters is his wife), and he ran an impressive 9.86 at a Diamond League race in China in 2018. But he failed to secure a spot in the 100 meters when he finished seventh of eight runners in the final at the U.S. Olympic Trials in 2021. He announced last year that he would become world champion in both the 200 and the 100 meters in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nGiven that his biggest liability in the 100 meters was -- and remains -- his block starts, it was a lofty goal. The 27-year-old, one of the rare track and field athletes to jump from high school to the pros, met that first goal: He won three golds in Budapest, surprising the field with his 10-meter victory, getting his third consecutive 200-meter world championship and joining with Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Brandon Carnes to win the 4x100-meter relay.\n\nThe success only fueled him to match the feat at the Olympics. He got that 100-meter gold by the smallest of margins and still has his signature event on deck. The Americans are also the favorite in the relay, but after the disaster of Tokyo, where they didn't even qualify for the medal race, the latest in a comedy of errors that hasn't seen the U.S. win a medal in the men's 4x100 since 2004 or a gold since 2000, it might not be a given.\n\nBut from what we've seen of Lyles since that night in Tokyo, when he was despondent and bared his soul to a cadre of socially distanced strangers, it will be hard to bet against them. And hard not to cheer for him.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type":

He received medical treatment after crossing the line and after the race, U.S. officials said he had COVID, putting his participation in Friday's sprint relay final in serious doubt.\n\nAdding to the chaos, a yellow card appeared against his name in the official results to mark a misconduct violation for damaging his lane box.\n\nLyles might still hog the limelight, but it was Tebogo and Africa's night. It is common to see a clutch of Africans in major middle and long-distance races, but this was the first time in Olympic history that four appeared in a sprint final.\n\nAlthough three filled the last three places in the final, Tebogo's place on top of the podium was a huge leap forward.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of - it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew when the gun went Kenny was going to run away so make sure just to close him down, I have that top end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "50 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--SnzDD6M7--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-08-08t183808z_1_lynxmpek770ue_rtroptp_3_olympics-2024-athletics.jpg?itok=hXdxv6V5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The 27-year-old Lyles had to work hard to finish second in 20.08.\n\nAmericans Kenny Bednarek, Olympic silver medallist in Tokyo, and Erriyon Knighton each won their semi-finals, Bednarek clocking 20.00 and the 20-year-old Knighton crossing in 20.09.\n\nRounding out the field for today's final are Alexander Ogando of the Dominican Republic, Joseph Fahnbulleh of Liberia, and Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu and Makanakaishe Charamba.\n\nLyles, the three-times reigning world champion over what has always been his stronger event, has not lost over the distance since he had to settle for bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHis run yesterday, however, was reminiscent of his sluggish 100m semi-final after which he reached out to his therapist for guidance. He came out two hours later and electrified the crowd by winning the most competitive men's 100m in Olympic history.\n\nLyles did not stop to speak to reporters, heading straight to see medical experts, a USA Track and Field spokesperson said.\n\nHe is looking to become the first American in four decades to win the Olympic sprint double and is aiming for potentially four golds in Paris, in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay, and -- if he is selected in the squad -- the 4x400m relay.\n\nCanada's defending champion Andre de Grasse, the last man to beat Lyles in a competitive race over the distance, did not advance to the final.\n\n\"I reactivated a lingering issue in my hamstring,\" De Grasse said. \"It was going to be tough today. I knew I had to go out there and try to do my best and see what I can come up with.\n\n\"It's tough. It's been a tough 24, 48 hours.

The 19-year-old produced a dominant performance, clocking a time of 19.46 seconds to claim Botswana's first Olympic gold medal.\n\nTebogo, who had won bronze at the World Championships last year and set a national record of 9.86 seconds in the 100m final in Paris, powered clear of the American duo of Kenny Bednarek and Noah Lyles to secure the coveted title. Bednarek took the silver medal with a time of 19.62 seconds, while Lyles, who was hoping to become the first American to complete the sprint double since Carl Lewis 40 years ago, had to settle for bronze in 19.67 seconds.\n\nThe race was not without its drama, as U.S. officials revealed that Lyles had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the final. A yellow card was also displayed against his name in the official results, further adding to the intrigue of the event.\n\nTebogo's victory is a significant moment for African athletics, as the continent has traditionally struggled to make its mark in the sprinting events at the highest level. The young Botswanan's triumph will undoubtedly inspire a new generation of athletes across Africa and beyond.\n\nWith his impressive performance, Tebogo has cemented his place among the elite sprinters in the world, becoming the fifth-fastest man in history over the 200m distance. His dominant display, which comes two months after his mother's death, is a testament to his dedication, hard work and the growing talent pool in Botswana's athletics programme.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2014_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2014 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tebogo-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Tebogo, 21, became the youngest man to win gold in the 200 meters since the United States' Bobby Morrow in 1956 and the first man from an African nation to do so in Olympic history.\n\nAll eyes entering the event were on United States sprinting sensation Noah Lyles, who won the 100 meters on Sunday and had an eye on setting a world record in the 200 meters. He was looking to become the first American to pull off the 100-200 double since Carl Lewis in 1984.\n\nInstead, Lyles, who battles asthma and wore a mask backstage before being introduced, looked gassed after the race. He never came near the lead before ultimately finishing third in 19.70 seconds for a bronze medal.\n\nHis personal best in the 200 meters is 19.31 seconds, an American record set at the 2022 World Championships, and his season best was 19.53 seconds set at the U.S. Olympic Trials in June.\n\nBetween the duo was fellow American Kenny Bednarek, who won a silver medal in 19.62 seconds.

He received medical treatment after crossing the line and after the race U.S. officials said he had tested positive for COVID on Tuesday, two days after he won the 100-meter gold.\n\n\"In response (to the test, the USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" USATF said in a statement.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nAdding to the chaos, a yellow card appeared against Lyle's name in the official results to mark a misconduct violation for damaging his lane box before the race start.\n\nThe Lyles show might still hog much of the limelight, but on the track it was Tebogo and Africa's night. It is common to see a clutch of Africans in major middle and long-distance races, but this was the first time in Olympic history that four appeared in a sprint final.\n\nAlthough three filled the last three positions, Tebogo's place on top of the podium in an African record was a huge leap forward.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of -- it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old told reporters. \"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew Kenny was going to run away so made sure just to close him down, I have that top-end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"\n\nBednarek, the man in the middle again, ran a fantastic bend in lane eight and finished strongly, but not just quite fast enough.\n\n\"I don't think I put my best race down, it was really tight at the end,\" he said.\n\n\"This year I'm finally healthy.

The bronze medal was a bonus. - The Boston Globe", "body": "So he moved out of the Olympic village and into a nearby hotel to get some distance from teammates, took all the medications allowable, wore a mask through race trials, and pushed himself back out there for Thursday's final.\n\nHis 19.70 finish wouldn't prove to be enough for a win. That went to 21-year-old Letsile Tebogo of Botswana, who ran a 19.46. American Kenneth Bednarek won silver, repeating, like Lyles, the same finish he'd had in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nBut as much as the postrace story was about Lyles's illness, it was even more about his ability to deal with the setback. Unlike his Tokyo experience, when he was so full of anxiety and so absent of joy that he was unable to perform at his best, the Lyles who fell to the track after Thursday's race and could barely get up, the one who had get the assistance of race officials with a wheelchair to make it back to the medical team, wasn't going to beat himself up the way he did three years ago.\n\nHe has grown enough to understand that being out there was the win itself; the bronze medal was a bonus. He was able to give himself grace for something happening that was beyond his control, to lean into the support from his girlfriend, Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield, as well as his personal therapist, and do the best he could under difficult, unexpected circumstances.\n\n\"I'm more proud of myself than anything coming out and getting the bronze medal with getting COVID three days ago,\" Lyles said. \"It definitely affected my performance. I've had to take a lot of breaks, lots of fluids.\n\n\"Even Janelle was saying that I was coughing through the night last night. I thought I had a good night's sleep but she said she had to keep moving me throughout the night to make sure that I would stop coughing.\"\n\nIt was clear as soon as the race was over that Lyles wasn't quite right. He dropped to the ground just outside the track's first curve, just steps beyond the finish line, and lay on his back. He was there as Tebogo celebrated, as Bednarek gathered his American flag and found family in the stands, as the results were officially announced and the track began resetting for the next race.\n\nEventually Lyles rolled sideways and got his torso off the ground, but even the effort to get to his knees proved too much. Eventually, he was helped off in the wheelchair.\n\nInitially, it appeared that the extraordinary mental and physical effort that went into his 100 win had taken a toll. But as Lyles explained later, his gas tank was empty for another, more serious reason.\n\n\"I tested positive around 5 a.m. Tuesday morning,\" he said. \"I woke up in the middle of the night just feeling the chills, aching, sore throat. And those were kind of a lot of the symptoms I've always had right before getting COVID and I was just like, I need to test this one. We tested it and you know, came back positive.\n\n\"I still wanted to run the final. It was still possible, so we just stayed away from everybody and just tried to take it round by round and, you know, to be honest, I knew if I wanted to come out here I would have to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn't have any time to save energy. So that was kind of the strategy.\"\n\nLyles was unable to say whether he'd run in Friday night's 4x100 relay, where the US men are favored for gold. Again, with the benefit of growth, perspective, and maturity, he was able to accept how much of this is out of his hands.\n\n\"I'll talk to the coaches,\" he said. \"I've been very honest and transparent with them, and I'm going to let them make the decision.\n\n\"I believe that no matter what's happened, this four-by-one team is very capable, they can handle anything and everything. I've been with them in practice. They are more than capable to come out with a win and even break as many records as they stick their mind to.\"\n\nLyle was soon ushered away by Team USA officials, walking slowly by their sides as he exited the mixed zone. But unlike three years ago, the lack of a bounce in his step did not signify sadness, anxiety, or depression. He knew he'd done his best, and that was enough.\n\nAs he told NBC, \"My first thought was not to panic, thinking I've been in worse situations. I've run with worse conditions.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junelle_Bromfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Junelle Bromfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/RCr_JeyglYmemlhes-upkM7Li0A=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/RG6DEF5HOBBILLG2CSUYRFB67M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

He required medical treatment trackside and, after being briefly placed in a wheelchair, recovered to speak with media from behind a mask.\n\n\"I do have Covid,\" he said. \"I tested positive at around 5am on Tuesday morning. There were a lot of symptoms. We tested it and it came back positive. We quickly quarantined to a hotel near the village to get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure my body was able to just keep the momentum going.\n\n\"I was going to compete regardless. We just stayed away from everybody and took it round by round. This is the best I've felt out of the last three days. I'm not 100 per cent - but 90 to 95 per cent.\"\n\nAsked if his competitors, including American team-mate Kenny Bednarek, and those he raced in Wednesday night's semi-final, had known, Lyles admitted that he had largely kept his virus secret.\n\n\"We tried to keep this as close to my chest, most of the people who knew were the medical staff, my coach, my mom and my family,\" he said. \"We didn't want everybody going into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it as discreet as possible.\n\n\"You never want to tell your competitors you are sick - why would you give them an edge over you? It definitely affected my performance. I was coughing through the night last night. I'm more proud of myself than anything - to come out and get the bronze medal with Covid.\"\n\nTebogo, who began celebrating Bolt-style some metres before the finish, would still have taken some beating. Lyles's personal best is 19.31sec and Tebogo dominated the race from start to finish, producing the fifth-fastest 200m in history to run 19.46sec and win his country's first Olympic gold.\n\nThe 21-year-old's closest challenge was Bednarek, who beat Lyles to repeat the silver medal he had won in Tokyo with a time of 19.62sec.\n\nLyles said that the USA team will decide on Friday whether he lines up in the 4x100m relay later that day.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/algCeSdKclJIjdXV3kMWyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/e856e395b2f6bb50a5b935e2bef9c913", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Tebogo's remarkable performance not only secured him the top spot on the podium but also left world champion and 100m Olympic champion Noah Lyles in disbelief as he settled for bronze.\n\nThe men's 200m final was highly anticipated, especially with Noah Lyles chasing a potential quadruple gold haul.\n\nNoah Lyles, running in lane five, was widely expected to dominate, with fierce competition from Erriyon Knighton in lane six, Tebogo in lane seven, Kenny Bednarek in lane eight, and Joseph Fahnbulleh in lane nine. The tension was palpable as the athletes lined up, with the crowd's excitement needing to be hushed before the start.\n\nFrom the start, Lyles seemed to be in control, getting off to a powerful beginning alongside Bednarek. However, as they approached the curve, it was Tebogo who emerged as the surprise contender. The Botswana sprinter, running with extraordinary speed and determination, surged ahead in the final stretch. As the finish line approached, it became clear that Tebogo was going to make history.\n\nCrossing the line in an African record time of 19.46 seconds, Tebogo claimed the gold, leaving Bednarek to take silver with a time of 19.62 seconds. Noah Lyles, the reigning world champion and heavy favourite, could only manage bronze, finishing in 19.70 seconds.\n\nLetsile Tebogo's victory is not just a personal achievement but a monumental moment for African athletics. His win marks the first time an African man has ever won the 200m gold at the Olympics, a milestone that will inspire future generations of athletes across the continent.\n\nThis race, one of the most memorable in recent Olympic history, showcased the depth of talent emerging from Africa, with Tebogo now firmly establishing himself as one of the brightest stars in global athletics.

That he did it while thumping his chest before crossing the line doubly so. Behind him was Bednarek, who ran 19.62, while Lyles could finish only third in 19.70 after appearing to struggle with the tight bends at the Stade de France track in lane five.\n\nTwo years ago, Tebogo made a bold pronouncement: \"I want to be remembered as one of the best athletes who ever lived.\" Last year he made a good start as he won world 100m silver and 200m bronze. But there was a sense that he was building. And so it proved as the run a brilliant bend to take gold.\n\nLyles, meanwhile, could not believe what happened as he collapsed to the ground and left the arena in a wheelchair.

It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show. Whether you were rooting for me or against me, you have to admit you watched, didn't you?\"\n\nThe post came shortly after Lyles finished a disappointing third in the men's 200 meters, his signature event. He received medical assistance following the race and was wheeled off of the track.\n\nLyles, who also suffers from asthma, awoke Tuesday with a sore throat, aches and chills, telltale signs to him that he had COVID-19 according to Yahoo! Sports. After a test came back positive, he quarantined in a local hotel, rested, got fluids and loaded up on medicine that wouldn't violate anti-doping rules. He finished second in a preliminary run Wednesday before Thursday's bronze.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" Lyles said after running a 19.70 seconds, nearly four-tenths slower than his personal best.\n\nHe added he did not consider skipping the race, and there are no rules in place prohibiting COVID-positive athletes from competing. Instead, the call is up to the teams and athletes themselves. Lyles was seen wearing a surgical mask prior to the races Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" a statement from USA Track & Field read. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely. As an organization, we are rigorously adhering to CDC, USOPC, and IOC guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nLyles was hoping to complete the coveted 100-200 double after winning the 100 meters on Sunday, two days before he started feeling symptoms. He was also expected to compete on the men's 4x100 relay, though his Instagram post certainly puts that in doubt.\n\n\"I'll talk to the coaches,\" Lyles said. \"To be honest, I want to be very honest and transparent with them.

For how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety we get, you know, the fact that hasn't happened, that's crazy to me.\"\n\nAccording to Sportico, Lyles did sign a \"lucrative contract extension\" with Adidas earlier this year, reportedly the richest in track and field since Usain Bolt's Puma deal.

run", "body": "However a resurfaced clip about Hall involving Lyles has prompted fans to ask the Team USA track star to apologise to his teammate\n\nTeam USA track star Quincy Hall shocked everyone on Wednesday night as he claimed gold in the men's 400m final.\n\nThe 26-year-old crossed the finish line ahead of Team GB's Matthew Hudson-Smith and Muzala Samukonga of Zambia in dramatic fashion, charging from behind to knip the gold away from the Great Britain athlete.\n\nHall ran an exceptional race, finishing the race with a time of 43.40 - 0.04 seconds ahead of the British sprinter.\n\nThe American's stellar performance in the final earned a shoutout from the current 'fastest man in the world' and fellow Team USA member Noah Lyles.\n\nLyles who won gold in the 100m final on Sunday took to the social media platform 'X' to state that his compatriot was a certified DAWG.\n\nLyles took to 'X' after the race to call Hall a certified DAWG\n\nQuincy Hall claimed gold in the men's 400m final in dramatic fashion, charging from behind to knip the top prize\n\nThe impressive victory earned a shoutout from fellow Team USA star and Olympic champion Noah Lyles\n\nFollowing Lyle's social display of support, a resurfaced interview clip from a podcast which Lyles was on has gone viral.\n\nPrompting many fans to ask Lyles to take back previous comments he made about his fellow American sprinter.\n\nThe current 100m Olympic and world champion featured on the 'Track World News' podcast in late July, just before he departed for Paris.\n\nOn the podcast Lyles was asked to select his ideal 4x400m relay team.\n\nLyles who is arguably the most recognised sprinter in the world right now opted to leave Hall off his ideal relay team.\n\nInstead deciding to go with Chris Bailey, Michael Norman, Rai Benjamin, and himself.\n\nA clip of Lyles seemingly dissing Hall has resurfaced following the American's impressive run\n\nThe clip features Lyles on the 'Track World News' podcast where he says he wouldn't include Hall in his 4x400m relay team\n\nCiting that he believed other athletes would be a better fit for his team, the 100m Olympic champion suggested that using Hall in the first leg of a 4x400m relay would be a waste as he didn't see him as a starter.\n\nGoing further to imply that he didn't believe Hall's talents would be well optimised in any leg of the relay.\n\n'The only reason I wouldn't use the current U.S. champion is that I just don't think he'd be a starter,\" Lyles said.\n\n'Using him on the first leg would almost be like a waste of his talents.'\n\nThe slight diss warranted a response from Hall who took offence to the exclusion.\n\nHe responded on 'X' with a tweet of his own which read 'Noah Lyles, I don't bother nobody, but my blocks ready anytime you feel like you can beat me in the 400,\n\n'You was talking to much on my name on yo little podcast, Track World News, I don't do the little slick comments and remarks I line up.' he added.\n\nA short time after his initial response, Hall doubled down on his comments posting a minute-long video to 'X' after some said he was overreacting and Lyles' comments weren't meant as a diss.\n\nHall took offence to the slight diss and responded to Lyles with a tweet and video of his own\n\nHe accompanied the video with the caption:\n\n'For the folk who mad saying he didn't diss me or I'm overthinking yall can miss me with all that im rapped out about the situation my blocks still ready but if we ain't doing it that's coo to but let me get ready for the Olympics'\n\nAfter Hall claimed victory in the 400m, many fans took to social media calling for Lyles to say something now.\n\nOne 'X' user wrote 'What is Noah Lyles going to say now?\n\n'Looks like Quincy Hall was ready for the 400-meter\n\nBefore another added 'This is the Quincy Hall that Noah Lyles want to remove from 4X400m Must be a joke' followed by two laughing emojis.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

The 27-year-old is still looking for gold in the 200-meter sprint, which would make him the first man since Usain Bolt in the 2016 Rio Games to win both the 100-meter and 200-meter races, or what's known as the \"double.\"\n\nLyles is the heavy favorite to win the event -- his odds are at -460 on FanDuel Sportsbook -- as he's significantly more experienced in the 200-meter than in the 100-meter. His 200-meter accolades encompass three world championships, including the last two titles, and a bronze medal from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nOn Monday, Lyles won his Round 1 heat and qualified for the 200-meter semifinals, slowing in the final stretch when he had clearly won the race.\n\n\"The 200 is my wife, and the 100 is my mistress,\" Lyles said on the Netflix docuseries \"Sprint\" before winning the double in the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\nDouble or not, Lyles's win in the 100-meter, the most prestigious track event, solidifies his title as the fastest man in the world.\n\nComparisons between Bolt and Lyles are inevitable, and the American has declared that he wants to challenge Bolt's world-record times.\n\n\"He's the fastest man to ever do it, and soon it'll be me,\" Lyles told CNN in March.\n\nBut, like Bolt, Lyles also wants to impact the sport beyond the track. Bolt's dominance and longevity made him the face of the sport, but his bravado, which includes a signature pose, made him one of the world's most marketable athletes.\n\nLyles, from his shots at NBA players to showing Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before big races, has already shown the swagger to become a media focal point. The question now is how high he can go in a sport that only receives significant international fanfare every four years during the Olympics.\n\nAfter winning the 100-meter race on Sunday, Lyles, an Adidas athlete since 2016, told reporters that he wants his own signature shoe, particularly a training shoe and not a track-and-field spike.\n\n\"I want my own shoe. I want my own trainer. Dead serious. I want a sneaker, ain't no money in spikes. There's money in sneakers,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt may not be a coincidence that Lyles made his statement the day after Bolt launched a signature lifestyle shoe with Puma.\n\nAthletic brands often reserve their signature shoes for athletes in more accessible and marketable sports, particularly basketball. There are some other athletes with their own signature lines that come with lifestyle and training shoes, such as On with Roger Federer and Adidas with Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThose are two of the greatest athletes in their sport's history, so a shoe or clothing line would cement Lyles as the face of track and field.\n\n\"With today's win, and everything he has achieved in his career so far, Noah has cemented his greatness and place as one of the leading athletes in the world. We're proud to have been able to support him on every step of his journey since our partnership began in 2016,\" said Alberto Uncini Manganelli, Adidas's general manager of running and credibility sports, in a statement after Sunday's race.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_mccarthy@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Michael McCarthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_schiffer@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Alex Schiffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletic trainer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23910498_168392832_lowres.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nThe world knows him as Noah Lyles, Olympic gold medalist and now two-time bronze medalist, world champion and one of the fastest men in the world.\n\nBut to many Alexandrians, he's long been a hometown hero. The Olympian graduated from Alexandria City High School in 2016, then known as T.C. Williams, and was a standout on the track along with his brother, Josephus.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, ahead of Lyles' 200-meter race, about 400 people gathered for a watch party in Alexandria City's gymnasium, hosted by the city of Alexandria, the Lyles Brothers Sports foundation and Alexandria City's public school system.\n\nSpotty showers didn't stop them from filling the auditorium. Red, white and blue balloon garlands were on full display as guests entered, greeted by red and blue pompoms ruffling together nonstop. Guests showed off their American pride, donning blue glow-in-the-dark glasses, bracelets and necklaces.\n\nBefore the race started, attendees passed around a blue canvas where they wrote notes of encouragement and congratulations for Lyles. The idea came from Romona Williams, a 57-year-old Alexandria resident who brought the canvas and wanted to document the event.\n\n\"We're here to capture the history of everybody coming together, unity in Alexandria City,\" said Williams, a mother of two Alexandria City graduates. \"They're showing love and writing good things. It doesn't take just his family to support [Lyles], this is a USA thing going on here.\"\n\nThe Lyles Brothers Sports foundation, which promotes health and wellness in Alexandria, kept the crowd entertained ahead of the race. They hosted a round of trivia, asking questions only true Lyles fans would know, for a grand prize of a Team Lyles hat. The fans delivered and answered all of the questions right, even down to his best record in a 200-meter race, birthday and first track event at Alexandria City: not the 200 meter but the high jump.\n\nAt 2:30 p.m., Lyles took off, and the crowd roared. As the runners got closer to the 200-meter mark, fans rose, hoping Lyles would inch closer to take the lead. When he crossed the finish line and ended in third place -- not the outcome many had hoped for -- a mix of groans and sighs of disappointment filled the auditorium.\n\nBut shortly after, the moment of defeat turned into pride. The Alexandria City marching band played their fight song as fans remained standing.\n\n\"We love you, Noah!\" they chanted.\n\nThe stream at the auditorium ended before guests could see Lyles leaving the field in a wheelchair. His covid infection came as news to close family and friends at the watch party, who said they were waiting on confirmation from Lyles's mother, Keisha Caine Bishop.\n\nBishop called Lori Hawkins, special events coordinator of the Lyles Brothers Sports Foundation, about an hour after the race confirming Lyles had covid.\n\n\"It wasn't going to stop him,\" Hawkins said. \"He still wanted to go out to do his best in the 200, and he came away with a bronze. So, we are so proud of him, and he's a proud of himself. He did it.\"\n\nFor Delano Frazer, Lyles's older brother, proud was an understatement. The 34-year-old made it to the watch party just in time to watch his brother race. Although Lyles didn't get the gold, Frazer said placing in the Olympics is enough of an achievement he can carry with pride forever.\n\n\"It's still surreal that my brother's up there,\" Frazer said. \"You already won the 100, still to say you're the fastest man in the world. You have that title, run with it, and you come back with a bronze in the 200.\"\n\nGetting the gold may have been the goal, but to see Lyles place in the Olympics was enough for Sharon Hennessee, assistant events coordinator at the Lyles Brothers Sports foundation.\n\n\"I'm always just proud to see Noah out there doing the best that he can -- win, lose, draw, however -- just watching him out there because you can't get to the level that he's at without doing a lot of work to get there. ... I know that the family is proud of him, no matter where he places,\" Hennessee said.\n\nIt's unclear whether Lyles will compete in more races, such as the 100-meter relay. But Alexandrians will have other ways to celebrate their hero: At local restaurant Holy Cow, fans can order a burger named after the athlete. Like Lyles, it's got the full package: angus beef, cheddar, bacon, sweet bread and butter pickles, lettuce, tomato and ranch on a brioche bun.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_d_brown@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Jordan D.

The Florida native already claimed gold once, winning the 100-meter dash in dramatic fashion, narrowly defeating the field in a photo finish.\n\nNow Lyles has a chance at winning double gold when he hits the track at Stade de France on Thursday, aiming to win the 200-meter race. He owns the world's third-fastest time in the event and is viewed as the favorite to take the sprint.\n\nLyles does not lack any confidence in himself -- a key component of why he is an Olympic gold medalist and six-time world champion. That belief he has in himself flows over into his appearance as well. Lyles paints his fingernails before races, joining a select list of high-end athletes who do so.\n\nHe also wears a thick necklace around his neck that seemingly does not hold him back when it comes to the races.\n\nHere is more to know about Lyles' necklace and where it is from.\n\nUSA OLYMPICS MEDAL COUNT: Overall table | U.S. medal tracker | Who has won gold?\n\nWhen Lyles won the 100-meter race earlier in the Olympics, a necklace made of white metal with mariner links was seen around his neck.\n\nFor those who have been following Lyles' track and field career, it may not come as a surprise to see it. He previously wore the chain at other competitions, including the 2023 World Athletics Championships where he swept the 100-meter and 200-meter events.\n\nLooking at the necklace, it appears to be made out of three different metals, alternating between white, yellow and silver gemstones that appear to be diamonds.\n\nMORE: How Noah Lyles overcame depression, anxiety to make Olympics run\n\nIt's unclear who makes the necklace. Lyles has not discussed the piece of jewelry much at all in his career, so the creator and cost of the necklace are not known.\n\nIt is possible that the necklace is the product of The Village Jeweler, a jewelry company based out of Gainesville, Fla., -- Lyles' hometown. The company previously posted on Facebook in 2021 that it appeared to create a ring for Lyles, consisting of rose gold accents and gemstones that represented the five Olympic rings.\n\nIn addition, The Village Jeweler also posted a 2021 TikTok video of Lyles discussing a custom rose gold and diamond necklace he bought from the company.\n\nEither way, like the painted fingernails, the necklace only adds to Lyles' aura, and it certainly has worked so far at the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gemstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/GettyImages-2165277364.jpg?itok=sl7aiSr_", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Petr David Josek/Associated Press\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- Noah Lyles lost the Olympic 200 meters Thursday, falling to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo, then being tended to by medics who carted him off the track in a wheelchair. Later, wearing a mask as he spoke with reporters, Lyles said he had COVID.\n\nAfter crossing the line third for the second straight Olympics, Lyles fell to his back and writhed around in pain, staying down for nearly 30 seconds before getting up, asking for water and getting to the wheelchair.\n\nIt's the second straight Olympics the virus has played a major role in Lyles' trip to the Games. He also won the bronze in the Tokyo Olympics, and he has said the empty stands and the year-long delay before the Games led to depression that hampered his performance and inspired his road to Paris.\n\nTebogo, 21, led wire-to-wire and won in 19.46 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in history, but .15 slower than Lyles' top time. Kenny Bednarek finished in 19.62 for his second straight silver, and Lyles, four nights after winning a close-as-can-be 100, ran the curve in 19.70.\n\nThe first sign something might be wrong came a night earlier when Lyles finished second in a lackluster semifinal, then left the track without talking to reporters to head to the medical tent. His coach said he was fine. It became clear he was not when Tebogo and Bednarek reached the curve in the final.\n\nLyles was trailing as they headed into the homestretch, which is usually where he puts on a trademark closing finish that has always been the best part of this race. This time - nothing. Only a desperate push to the line then a collapse onto the purple track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWATER POLO: The U.S. women's water polo team was eliminated by Australia in the semifinals of the Paris Olympics on Thursday night, ending its run for a fourth consecutive gold medal.\n\nAustralia went 6 for 6 in a penalty shootout and goalkeeper Gabi Palm denied Maddie Musselman on the last attempt of the tiebreaker, sending the Aussies into the final. It was Australia's third win of the Paris Games via penalty shootout.\n\nNext up for Australia is Spain, which advanced with a 19-18 victory over the Netherlands in a penalty shootout. The gold-medal match is on Saturday at Paris La Defense Arena.\n\nThe U.S. blew a 5-2 halftime lead in its second loss of the Paris Games and third loss at the Olympics overall since it dropped the 2008 final against the Netherlands. It went 5-0-1 in London, 6-0 in Rio de Janeiro and 6-1 in Tokyo.\n\nNo team - men's or women's - has won four straight water polo titles at the Olympics.\n\nMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY: A sprinkler inexplicably went off and delayed play for a couple of minutes. A dramatic shootout victory set off a wild celebration that was interrupted briefly when a scuffle almost broke out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe men's Olympic field hockey final had a little bit of everything. And now the Netherlands has gold for the first time in more than two decades.\n\nDuco Telgenkamp scored the golden goal in the shootout to give the Dutch the title at the Paris Games with a 2-1 victory over Germany. It's the Netherlands' first gold in men's hockey at the Olympics since 2000 and third in the country's history.\n\nAs Dutch players piled on each other in the corner to celebrate, Germany's Niklas Wellen took exception and began shoving a rival, leading officials to separate the teams.\n\nThe tensions were much different than the confusion nearly an hour earlier when water began spraying the sideline and field 3:28 into the third quarter. Workers ran over to stop the shower, and the crowd at Yves-du-Manoir Stadium cheered when the water went off after about two minutes.\n\nCYCLING: World champion Ellesse Andrews of New Zealand won the Olympic title in the women's keirin at the Paris Games on Thursday night, holding off Dutch rider Hetty van de Wouw and Britain's Emma Finucane in a sprint to the finish line.\n\nIn the men's omnium, Benjamin Thomas of France overcame a crash in the concluding points race to hold off Portugal's I\u00fari Leit\u00e3o for gold. He finished with 164 points, Leit\u00e3o had 153 and Fabio van den Bossche of Belgium took bronze with 131.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe keirin is a sprint race involving six riders who begin by pacing for three laps behind a motorized scooter. When it pulls off, the riders are left with three laps to conduct an elbow-to-elbow, high-speed dash to the finish.\n\nSPORT CLIMBING: Sam Watson leaves the Paris Games with another world record in speed sport climbing but without the Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe American broke the speed world record on Thursday for the second time at the 2024 Paris Olympics, but the feat came in the fight for the bronze after he was eliminated in the semifinals.\n\nThe 18-year-old Watson, the heavy favorite for the gold, lost to Wu Peng of China in the semifinals before setting a record of 4.74 seconds in the third-place heat. Leonardo Veddriq of Indonesia won the gold with a time of 4.75 in the final. Wu ended with 4.77.\n\nWOMEN'S GOLF: Morgane Metraux had eight 3s on her card on the front nine - an 8-under 28 - until getting slowed by the wind and a bad shot at the wrong time. She still had a 6-under 66, giving her a one-shot lead over Ruoning Yin of China at the halfway point of the women's golf competition.\n\nWRESTLING: Vinesh Phogat, the Indian woman who qualified for the Olympic final at 50 kilograms and then was disqualified for barely missing weight, announced her retirement on social media on Thursday.\n\nIn a post translated from Hindi, Phogat said: \"My courage is broken, I don't have any more strength now. Goodbye Wrestling, 2001-2024.\"\n\nUnited World Wrestling, the sport's governing body, disqualified Phogat on Wednesday morning. Team India said she was 100 grams - about a fifth of a pound - over the weight limit. Instead of becoming India's first woman to compete in an Olympic final, she went home empty-handed.\n\nCYCLING: A longtime stalwart of the U.S. women's pursuit squad, Chloe Dygert teamed with newly minted Olympic road race champion Kristen Faulkner, Jennifer Valente and Lily Williams to beat New Zealand in the finals. And in doing so, Dygert was able to finally hear her nation's anthem while standing on the top step of the podium.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories

His victory came an evening after American Cole Hocker came from far behind late to beat the favourites in the men's 1500m.\n\nHudson-Smith lowered his European record to 43.44 but it was only good enough for silver. He had been bidding to become the first British man to win the 400m since Eric Liddell in 1924, also in Paris.\n\nThe bronze went to Zambia's Muzala Samukonga in 43.74 as five men dipped below 44 seconds They included Grenada's Kirani James who had won gold in 2012, silver in 2016 and bronze at Tokyo 2020 before coming fifth.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

We woke up the doctors and we tested and unfortunately, it came up that I was positive for Covid.\"\n\nLyles later told reporters that his illness \"definitely affected my performance\".\n\n\"But to be honest, I'm more proud of myself than anything,\" he added. \"Coming out and getting the bronze medal with Covid.\n\n\"We tried to keep this as close to the chest.

This born showman swept into this 200 metres final like a whirlwind and shuffled away from it in a wheelchair.\n\nIn between, he saw his dream of becoming the first American man since Carl Lewis to win the Olympic sprint double dashed by a young Botswanan fuelled by pure emotion. Letsile Tebogo, who lost his mother only two months ago, stole Lyles's thunder by seizing gold with the fifth-fastest time in history, making 19.46sec look so easy that he could afford to drop his arms and thump his chest before the finish line.\n\nIt is all part of Lyles's thespian exuberance that he can be the central figure in the drama even in defeat. While it seemed at first as if this bronze medal - a huge downgrade on the Olympic title he had targeted for three years - was the product of poor strategy, he revealed in the bitter aftermath that it had all come down to him feeling poorly. All his meticulous preparation had come undone when, 24 hours before this race, he tested positive for Covid, leaving him unable to hit the blistering top speed that could have reeled in Tebogo.\n\nIn truth, even a peak-condition Lyles would have struggled to live with the 21-year-old in this mood. Tebogo was astounding, so blisteringly quick that he could afford to indulge in a premature celebration. The scene was reminiscent of Usain Bolt in that unforgettable 100m final at Beijing 2008, when, with the Jamaican the same age then as Tebogo is now, he shut down with 20 to spare and still ran 9.69. Oh for the fearlessness of youth. Lyles, at 27, is a relative veteran, encumbered by the vast expectations he heaps on himself.\n\nParis, he had long told anybody who would listen, was his stage. Lyles had orchestrated all the Netflix cameras and ostentatious headgear for this very moment, when he intended to deliver the double that would cement all those comparisons with Bolt. The longer sprint is by far his favourite event, where his best of 19.31 stands above even Michael Johnson's epochal run in Atlanta 28 years ago. There was even talk of hunting down Bolt's world record of 19.19, one of the finest in the book. But the onset of illness soon punctured these delusions of grandeur.\n\nLyles described how he knew as early as Tuesday morning, 36 hours after his 100m gold, that he was in trouble, \"feeling really horrible\". Sure enough, he tested positive for Covid, but tried desperately not to panic. He had run in worse predicaments, he said, and tried to stave off the worst effects by staying hydrated. And yet the 200m is a discipline that punishes even the slightest sign of ill health. Perhaps his sluggish semi-final time of 20.08 should have been a warning. For when it came to the final, he lacked his customary acceleration off the curve, trailing in behind Tebogo and US compatriot Kenny Bednarek in a result that no one had foretold.\n\nThe timing is desperately unfortunate. For all that Lyles can grate with his look-at-me excesses, and his stated aim to emulate Michael Jordan by launching his own range of trainers, he is the carnival act that athletics sorely needs. Where Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the superstar of the night with her 50.37 world record in the 400m hurdles, gives precious little away in interviews, Lyles is unabashedly an open book, happy to talk about everything from his music collection to his nail polish. He adores the limelight to such an extent that he even gatecrashed a Mondo Duplantis interview after the Swede's giddying 6.25m pole vault, shrieking \"All-star, let's go!\"\n\nThis time he was a touch more muted, knowing how rare an opportunity had passed him by. Only nine men in history have doubled up at the Olympics over 100 and 200, and Lyles fully intended to be the 10th. But he was upstaged by a brilliant Botswanan sprinter on a single-minded quest. His mother died on May 19, and he left little doubt that he was still in profound grief, crossing the line with his hand on his heart.\n\n\"It wasn't really clicking for me that she's really gone,\" Tebogo explained. \"I have to find the reason why I started my athletics journey and why I should continue going on.\" The spikes that he brought here to Paris were also marked with her date of birth to honour her. \"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field. To take her with me, it gives me a lot of motivation. She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy. I didn't want to put the date of her death, because I'll get emotional.\"\n\nLittle in this Paris sprint programme has unfolded as predicted. Champions have sprung from the unlikeliest places: first came Julien Alfred from St Lucia, and now Tebogo from Botswana, both grasping their countries' first gold medals in Olympic history. It has been a stirring reflection of this sport's universal appeal.\n\nLyles, however, has been left cursing his luck. He arrived here with designs only on being the history man. Instead, he has been reduced to the unfortunate invalid.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Besides a gold medal and bragging rights, sprinter Noah Lyles hopes the distinction comes with a signature sneaker.\n\n\"I want my own shoe. I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious,\" said Lyles after his victory Sunday in the men's 100 meters at the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I want a sneaker, ain't no money in [track] spikes. There's money in sneakers and even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals [track athletes] bring back, for all the notoriety [track athletes] get, the fact that that hasn't happened yet is crazy to me.\"\n\nIt's a point of order, but Johnson got a signature sneaker, the Nike Zoom JST, in 1998. The shoe didn't sell particularly well, and that might be part of a more significant hurdle that even the best track star might find too high. Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man ever, also received the signature treatment during his track career. In June 2012, Bolt's longtime endorser, Puma, released the evoSpeed Runner Usain Bolt ahead of the London Olympics, where he won gold in the 100-meter final with a still-standing record time of 9.63 seconds. Puma also delivered the signature Bolt evoSpeed cleat, which he wore in his final Olympics appearance in 2016.\n\nFor all the well-deserved notoriety people such as Lyles, Sha'Carri Richardson, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and Allyson Felix bring to their sport every four years, it's still just every four years. Track and field remains a niche sport that airs on television in spots not quite ready for prime time. The sport isn't seeing the commas the NBA and WNBA just saw in their landmark broadcast deals. Occupying that more minor part of the media landscape means less recognizable faces. The unfortunate reality is that runners stay in the limelight when their names appear in a scandal. And that's even if they have a couple of medals to their name. While Lyles' point about track competitors facing world-class competition is valid, along with his beliefs about their athletic ability, those facts alone don't move the needle much.\n\nIt's easy to understand why Lyles wants this for himself and, more importantly, for the sport he loves. Even without squinting, it's not impossible to see his vision. The Virginia native ruffled a few feathers at the world championships in 2023 when he compared track and the NBA, questioning the legitimacy of the league calling itself \"world champions.\" While the comments went viral, the context of his words fell on deaf ears. Lyles made a more significant point about attracting attention to the sport. Winning medals is his first, second, and third goal. Still, he never stopped thinking about how to leverage that success for a larger platform.\n\n\"After you get the medals, more and more people gain interest. You can go into fashion, you can go into music. You can start collaborating with people and start meeting bigger and better athletes. From athletes, you go to artists and from artists, you go to the world. And now you have connections,\" Lyles said.\n\nLyles makes those connections by transforming himself into an undeniable brand. Skills alone no longer pay the bills. But combining one's ability with a gift of gab and a flair for the dramatic usually equals set for life. And Lyles is halfway there.\n\nSimilarly to Richardson, Felix, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and track legends such as sprinters Usain Bolt, Gail Devers, and Florence Griffith Joyner, the world's fastest man stands out. Lyles wore a striking pair of Adidas Adizero Y-3 spikes created by Paris-based Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto. He runs in chain-link necklaces covered in diamonds. The man also rocks a Speedmaster watch by Omega, the official timekeeper of the Olympics, and Lyles is a brand ambassador. Anyone can call themselves an icon, but few have the confidence to paint different designs and messages on their nails like the Alexandria, Virginia, native did for the Olympics. To Lyles' point about making connections, retired NBA guard Dwyane Wade noticed the nails and gave the gold medalist his props, as did NBA legend Magic Johnson. Besides Johnson's humble brag about watching the Olympics on a yacht, these looks can ensure Lyles' name rings bells in places that matter. It helps that he has the personality to match the jewelry and colorful digits.\n\nHe calls his shots and basks in the spotlight whenever it comes his way, especially if he can use it to his advantage. It didn't bother him when NBA players attacked him for those comments in 2023. For Lyles, the fact that they responded was a testament to his status.\n\n\"When I got the title of world's fastest man, now all of a sudden people perk up their ears like, 'The world's fastest man said that? I can't believe you would say something like that,' \" Lyles said.\n\nEven Bolt, the man Lyles wants to overtake in the record books, said the 27-year-old's personality and attitude are exactly what the sport needs. That same charisma Bolt sees is one reason Lyles is featured in the Netflix docuseries Sprint and is the subject of the upcoming Peacock series Untitled: The Noah Lyles Project. If success is about preparation, opportunity, and timing, the stars look aligned for Lyles, who has an endorsement deal with Adidas.\n\nConvincing Adidas to give him his patented sneaker is still easier said than done. A signature shoe deal usually pays the athlete 5% or 6% royalty sales of every shoe. The number of shoes sold should be enough to justify the millions invested in the athlete and help the company's bottom line. Suppose the typical deal pays a base salary between $5 million and $15 million annually and comes with a 5% royalty check for every shoe sold. In that case, that's an enormous bet that the company and the star must work in their favor. NBA players are on TV screens almost every night from October to June. Even if it's a game that does not feature someone with branded kicks, there's a good chance another player will wear a pair, given the relationship multiple players have with Nike, Adidas, and Under Armor. Lyles would need more close moments with audiences more often and find enough running buddies in and outside his sport willing to put his name on their feet.\n\nIt's a long shot, but what else is new for the man who earned America's first gold medal in the 100-meter dash in 20 years? Lyles is an asthmatic who runs faster than any man on the planet. He has attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, depression and anxiety. He wears those ailments as proudly as his love of Dragon Ball Z and Yu Gi Oh! It's easy for observers to side-eye his demand for his branded kicks. All it takes is one person and one moment to change everything. Lyles understands social media, wears his emotions on his sleeves, shows off with the best of them, and ensures all eyes stay on him.", "source": {"uri": "andscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He received medical treatment after crossing the line and after the race U.S. officials said he had tested positive for COVID on Tuesday, two days after he won the 100 metres gold.\n\n\"In response (to the test, the USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" USATF said in a statement.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nAdding to the chaos, a yellow card appeared against Lyle's name in the official results to mark a misconduct violation for damaging his lane box before the race start.\n\nAFRICA'S NIGHT\n\nThe Lyles show might still hog much of the limelight, but on the track it was Tebogo and Africa's night. It is common to see a clutch of Africans in major middle and long-distance races, but this was the first time in Olympic history that four appeared in a sprint final.\n\nAlthough three filled the last three positions, Tebogo's place on top of the podium in an African record was a huge leap forward.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of - it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew Kenny was going to run away so made sure just to close him down, I have that top-end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"\n\nBednarek, the man in the middle again, ran a fantastic bend in lane eight and finished strongly, but not just quite fast enough.\n\n\"I don't think I put my best race down, it was really tight at the end,\" he said.\n\n\"This year I'm finally healthy. I can build off this. There's also the world championships next year. I'm going to be dangerous.

He set a new African record as well as becoming the first person from Botswana to win an Olympic gold medal. Kenneth Bednarek and Lyles finished in second and third, respectively.\n\nTebogo dedicated his gold medal to his late mother who died in May 2024 due to an illness.\n\n\"I believe there is a medal in these legs and it only needs the determination and the willpower to do it,\" Tebogo said earlier during the 2024 Olympics. \"I've had such a huge blow that affected me deeply so I'm still trying to get the confidence back into the body. It's not about injuries, it is all about my mum.\"\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Tebogo's background.\n\nMORE: Full results, highlights from 200-meter final at 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nTebogo is a 21-year-old sprinter from Botswana. He won the gold medal in the 200-meter final at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nTebogo raced out to a 19.46 time, easily beating the pack for first place. Bednarek placed second with a time of 19.62 while Lyles finished third in 19.70.\n\nMORE: How many medals does Noah Lyles have?\n\nThe 19.46 time was an African record for the 21-year-old. Tebogo is making his Olympic debut in Paris. He also ran in the 100-meter final a few days ago, placing sixth with a time of 9.86.\n\nIt's the first Olympic medal of Tebogo's career, and he's only been a full-time track and field athlete since 2019. He played soccer as a teenager before realizing track and field would allow him to compete around the world.\n\n\"With athletics, I was going abroad and that was when I took that decision to transform from being a footballer to being an athlete,\" Tebogo told BBC in January.\n\nTebogo is from Botswana, which is located in the southern portion of Africa. The country has an approximate population of 2.53 million, according to worldometers.com.\n\nIt's the first gold medal for any African sprinter in the 200-meter, and first Olympic gold medal for any athlete from Botswana.

Lyles has the chance to become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete an Olympic sprint double after qualifying for the 200m final at Paris 2024.\n\nLyles won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday.\n\nThe 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, finished second in his semi-final in 20.08 seconds to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nWorld 100m silver and 200m bronze medallist Tebogo set the fastest time of the round at Stade de France on Wednesday evening, clocking 19.96secs.\n\nThe Olympic men's 200m final takes place on Thursday at 19:30 BST.\n\nKenneth Bednarek, of the United States, also set a faster time than Lyles, in 20.00, while compatriot Erriyon Knighton, who upgraded to world 200m silver last year, also safely progressed.\n\nBut Canada's Andre de Grasse will not defend his title in the final after finishing third in his race (20.41).\n\nThe Olympic 200m bronze winner three years ago, Lyles claimed world 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold in Budapest last year.\n\nFollowing that achievement, when he became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to complete a 100m and 200m world double, he claimed he could look to add the 4x400m relay title to that treble haul in Paris.\n\nJamaican sprint legend Bolt completed individual sprint doubles at three successive Olympic Games among his eight titles, adding relay gold in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOnly nine men have achieved that double in the history of the Games.\n\nLyles became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, with his narrow 100m triumph.\n\nA three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will line up as favourite as he looks to further assert himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.\n\nElsewhere during Wednesday's evening session, Great Britain's Amber Anning reached the final of the women's 400m.\n\nOlympic debutant Anning, 23, finished second in her semi-final in a personal best of 49.47.\n\nHowever, team-mates Laviai Nielsen (50.69) and Victoria Ohuruogu (51.14) missed out.\n\nIreland's Rhasidat Adeleke was among the other qualifiers for that final, which takes place on Friday at 19:00.\n\nTeam GB's Alastair Chalmers exited the men's 400m hurdles after suffering a fall in his semi-final.\n\nNorway's world record holder Karsten Warholm qualified fastest for the final in 47.67.\n\nTade Ojora was unable to reach the men's 110m hurdles final, finishing seventh in his heat.\n\nAmerican three-time world champion Grant

We'll see if that proves to be the case in just a few hours.\n\nRelated: Video: Noah Lyles Kept A Yu-Gi-Oh Card In His Shirt At Olympic Qualifying", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tzvi_machlin@postandcourier.com", "name": "Tzvi Machlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Morrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Morrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Why Trust Us?\n\nIn Paris on August 7, after 200-meter world champion and American record-holder Noah Lyles finished second in his semifinal heat of the 200 meters, he did not stop to talk to media in the mixed zone.\n\nThat was unusual for Lyles -- he isn't one to pass up the opportunity to speak. Instead, he was reported to be seeking medical treatment.\n\nAnd one day later, after the final of the 200 meters, the world knows why. Lyles tested positive for COVID on Tuesday morning, he told trackside reporter Lewis Johnson of NBC after the final. Letsile Tebogo of Botswana won in 19.46, Kenny Bednarek of the United States was second in 19.62, and Lyles was third in 19.70.\n\nLyles left the track in a wheelchair, but he went through the mixed zone, the subterranean room at Stade de France where athletes talk to the media, on foot. He was masked as he answered questions from reporters.\n\nHe said he started to feel poorly at about 5 a.m. on August 6, with a fever, chills and a sore throat. A test revealed COVID. But Lyles said it was \"never a thought\" not to compete and he said by the 200 meters on Thursday, he was at about 90 to 95 percent health. Lyles is taking Paxlovid.\n\nHe kept his diagnosis very private, so as not to give an advantage to his competitors.\n\nAll this begs the question: What are the rules about competing at the Olympics with COVID?\n\nShort answer: It's up to the athlete.\n\nScientific American reported that the Paris Games are treating COVID like any other respiratory illness. There are single rooms in the Olympic Village for athletes who have COVID. And athletes who are sick are encouraged to wear masks, wash their hands frequently, and avoid contact with others.\n\nLani Pallister, an Australian swimmer who contracted COVID, withdrew from the 1500 meters in order to save energy for a later race. An unnamed Australian water polo player was isolating after getting sick, but Anna Meares, the head of the Australian Olympic delegation, said in an article on the Olympic news service, \"I need to emphasize that we are treating COVID no differently to other bugs like the flu. This is not Tokyo.\"\n\nAthletes who have talked to reporters in the track's mixed zone said illnesses was circulating through the athletes at the Olympic Village. Jakob Ingebrigtsen spoke to media after the 1500 meters wearing a mask, thought to be a precaution. Grant Fisher, who won bronze in the 10,000 meters, was not staying in the village and in fact went back to altitude in St. Moritz, Switzerland, before the start of the 5,000 meters.\n\nIt has not yet been determined whether Lyles, who won the 100 meters, will compete on the 4 x 100-meter relay team for the U.S. \"I'm going to be honest and transparent with them and let them make the decision,\" Lyles said. \"I believe that no matter what happens, this 4 x 100 team can handle anything.\"\n\nUSA Track & Field did not immediately respond to questions from Runner's World.\n\nKenny Bednarek, silver medalist in the 200 from the U.S., said he hadn't noticed a lot of cases of COVID going around the Olympic Village in Paris. He added he didn't know that Lyles had COVID before the race and that it doesn't really bother him.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm just carefree and minding my own business,\" Bednarek said. \"There was a message that there was something going around, but I haven't seen anything.\"\n\nAs previously reported in Runner's World, rushing back to running and exercise after you've had COVID isn't always the best idea.\n\nIn May 2023, researchers published a literature review in Frontiers in Physiology to determine if high-intensity activity could be dangerous for someone with COVID infection. While intense exercise does come with benefits -- such as improved cardiovascular function and metabolic health -- they concluded that during and after a COVID infection, intense exercise influences the levels of stress hormones (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine), which may make COVID symptoms more severe.", "source": {"uri": "runnersworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Runner's

The American runner experienced both success and disappointment while also leaving in a wheelchair. So what happened?\n\nHeading into the game, the track and field star didn't hold his tongue as he spoke his mind about his intent to win multiple gold medals in Paris. He even hopped onto The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to say as much. He backed up his words by winning the 100-meter finals albeit by a hair -- almost literally. Then, he used the post-race press conference to claim he will win the 200-meter and that his competitors will be depressed when he comes off that turn during the race. He even directed his attention to his teammates, saying they won't win, including Kenny Bednarek.\n\nWell, despite always speaking his mind, he didn't quite back up his words this time, as Bednarek finished ahead of him, taking silver, and Letsile Twnogo from Botswana won gold. It forced Lyles to settle for bronze, which is something he has not bragged about but should certainly be happy about.\n\nHowever, immediately after the race, Lyles was seen struggling on the track, asking for water, and very clearly out of breath as if he had just run a marathon, causing people to speculate if he was sick and -- if he was -- why was he so extremely hyper before the race. In retrospect, it's incredibly odd to see him waste that energy, especially in a situation where he clearly needed it. He was then taken off the track on a wheelchair.\n\nLater on, he gave an interview while wearing a black mask and said he woke up feeling horrible two days before the race, then tested positive for Covid. \"We took it day by day,\" he said. \"It's taken its toll for sure.\"\n\nHowever, he refused to use it as an excuse, saying \"I ran in worse conditions.\" Since he was deemed sick, he was asked if he considered not running in the race, to which he answered, \"No.\" Lyles was expected to run in the 4x400m relay this weekend, but noted that he wasn't sure if he would because of his condition. He also stated that he was confident in the other runners who could represent the U.S. team, saying \"They've proven with great certainty that they can do it without me.\"\n\nSocial media was soon filled with people suggesting that his demeanor immediately after the race was embellished, with a little bit of exaggeration due to losing. One thing's for sure: Noah Lyles has a flair for the dramatic, but he does leave the Games with gold, and that's no exaggeration.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "curtis_roberts@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Curtis Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_8192.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday morning. Woke up in the middle of the night feeling chills, aching, sore throat and those were a lot of the symptoms I've always had right before getting Covid.\n\n\"We tested it and it came back positive so we quickly quarantined in a hotel near the village and get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to keep the momentum going.\n\n\"I still wanted to run, we decided it was still possible, so we just stayed away from everybody and tried to take it round by round. I knew if I wanted to come out here and win I would have to give everything I've had from the get go. I didn't have any time to save energy. That was the strategy.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I am more proud of myself than anything. Coming out and getting the bronze medal with Covid.\n\n\"We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mum knew.\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick.\n\n\"Why would you give them an edge?\"\n\nThe American world champion at the distance was hoping to become the first man since Usain Bolt at the Rio 2016 Games to secure both the 100 metres and 200 metres titles.\n\nHe had managed to bounce back to win 100 metres gold in Paris, but this time could not compensate for what was again the slowest reaction time of the pack.\n\nTebogo crossed in 19.46 for his first Olympic title and the United States' Kenny Bednarek snapped up silver.\n\nLyles was slowest off the blocks in 0.173 seconds but had clawed his way up to third by the 20- metre mark and remained in bronze medal position for the rest of the race, finishing in 19.70.\n\nTebogo and Bednarek battled for their positions, the American holding the lead just after the halfway point, but it was the Botswanan's race to lose from the 120 metres mark and he never looked close to letting go.\n\nTebogo, 21, became the first man from his country to win an Olympic 200 metres final and dedicated the medal to his mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who passed away last May.\n\nIt is a second 200 metres bronze for Lyles, who had also hoped to compete in the men's 4\u00d7100 metres and 4\u00d7400 metres relays in Paris, though the latter was a long-shot if he were in a position to secure four Olympic golds in one Games - a feat Bolt never achieved.\n\nLyles admitted he was feeling \"quite lightheaded\" and experienced chest pain following the 200 metres final, which he finished in 19.70 seconds.\n\nHe said: \"This is by far the best day I've felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I am 100 per cent but I am closer to 90 or 95.\n\n\"I only had one shot and then I will be down for a while. Me and my therapist said 'it's one and done, there is no holding back'.\n\n\"We haven't decided on the (4\u00d7100 metres) relay yet.\n\n\" I'll talk to the coaches and to be honest, I'm gonna be very honest and transparent with them, and I'm gonna let them make the decision.\n\n\"I believe that no matter what happens this four by one team can handle anything and everything. I've been with them in practice. They are more than capable to come out with a win and even break as many records as they take their mind to.\"\n\nA USA Track and Field statement read: \"We can confirm that Noah Lyles tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, August 6th. In response, the USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight.

in 2015 to complete a 100m and 200m world double, he claimed he could look to add the 4x400m relay title to that treble haul in Paris.\n\nJamaican sprint legend Bolt completed individual sprint doubles at three successive Olympic Games among his eight titles, adding relay gold in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOnly nine men have achieved that double in the history of the Games.\n\nLyles became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, with his narrow triumph.\n\nA three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will line up as favourite as he looks to further assert himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation\n\nElsewhere during Wednesday's evening session, Great Britain's Amber Anning reached the final of the women's

He received medical treatment after crossing the line and after the race U.S. officials said he had tested positive for COVID on Tuesday, two days after he won the 100 metres gold.\n\n\"In response (to the test, the USOPC and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritise his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors,\" USATF said in a statement.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nAdding to the chaos, a yellow card appeared against Lyle's name in the official results to mark a misconduct violation for damaging his lane box before the race start.\n\nAFRICA'S NIGHT\n\nThe Lyles show might still hog much of the limelight, but on the track it was Tebogo and Africa's night. It is common to see a clutch of Africans in major middle and long-distance races, but this was the first time in Olympic history that four appeared in a sprint final.\n\nAlthough three filled the last three positions, Tebogo's place on top of the podium in an African record was a huge leap forward.\n\n\"I'm the Olympic champion, it's something I have never seen in my life or dreamt of - it is an amazing moment,\" the 21-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"I just came here with the little that I had in me to push through because yesterday we made it to the final, my coach told me 'now it's your race'.\n\n\"I knew Kenny was going to run away so made sure just to close him down, I have that top-end speed that will allow me to finish the race without getting tired, so that's what I did, and when I saw Kenny fade I knew Noah was far, far away behind us so that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It means a lot for everybody, the country, the continent and my family.\"\n\nBednarek, the man in the middle again, ran a fantastic bend in lane eight and finished strongly, but not just quite fast enough.\n\n\"I don't think I put my best race down, it was really tight at the end,\" he said.\n\n\"This year I'm finally healthy. I can build off this. There's also the world championships next year. I'm going to be dangerous. I expect big things in the next four years.\"\n\nReporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitch_phillips@reuters.com", "name": "Mitch Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "50 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BRMFQXSS4JPVVMPI3BJELLHNBA.jpg?auth=6c26eeca3cb658f0575fca75a21d7be176566c95be30776206bdd13c01f5dff1&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He had stunned the world at the 2024 Paris Olympics, winning the 200m and earning the gold medal over heavy favorite Noah Lyles of the United States.\n\nTebogo made all sorts of history by beating Lyles, who settled for the bronze medal, and silver medalist Kenny Bednarek. But for track and field enthusiasts, Tebogo's emergence wasn't completely unexpected.\n\nHe has been a rising star for a few years, even drawing comparisons to Usain Bolt prior to his introduction to an international audience on Thursday. He also beat Lyles Wednesday in the 200m semifinals - the first race Lyles had lost in the 200m since the Tokyo Olympics - in a precursor to what Tebogo pulled off in the final.\n\nHere's what else you should know about Tebogo now that he's known for dethroning Lyles in his signature event:\n\nTebogo was born in Kanye, Botswana, a village in the southern portion of the country. He moved to Botswana's capital city, Gaborone, in the seventh grade.\n\nBy winning the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Tebogo became the first Olympic gold medal winner from Botswana and the first runner from Africa to win the 200m final at the Olympic Games. In 2023, he became the first African to win a medal in the 100m at the world championships.\n\n\"Africans can be sprinters, too,\" Tebogo declared to NBCSports.com in an interview before the Paris Games.\n\nTebogo's mother, Seratiwa, died in May from an illness and Tebogo said he dedicated his 200m gold medal win to her. Tebogo held up his shoe to the camera after the race, and it featured his mother's birthdate on it. He also painted her initials on his nails.\n\n\"I always think about her but I just try not to let it get into me that much and then just block it out and move forward,\" Tebogo said last week. \"I believe there is a medal in these legs and it only needs the determination and the willpower to do it. I've had such a huge blow that affected me deeply so I'm still trying to get the confidence back into the body. It's not about injuries, it is all about my mum.\"\n\nIn 2022, at the U20 world championships in Columbia, Tebogo set a world junior record in winning the 100m gold medal in 9.91 seconds. He was far enough ahead in the final stretch that he turned around and smiled at his nearest competitors. Tebogo later explained it was a tribute to Bolt as opposed to showboating.\n\n\"If somebody took it as disrespect, I'm really sorry,\" Tebogo said at the time, according to Reuters. \"(It was so) everybody watching at home can enjoy the race - to remind them a little bit about what Usain Bolt did back in the day. He's my idol - the person I look up to.\"\n\nThe display quickly drew comparisons to Bolt on social media and Bolt even retweeted a post featuring Tebogo's finish.\n\n\"I used to train without shoes,\" Tebogo told NBCSports.com. \"Shoes were more expensive and we couldn't afford that because we lived with our extended family, so it was difficult for us to get things. [If you did], it would be as if you were the favored child, so things had to be equal. So I used to train without shoes in both football and athletics. I would wear a pair of old pants that one of my uncles used to wear back when he was in school. It was just a generational thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaborone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaborone"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaborone"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye,_Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanye, Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kanye, Botswana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V0QQSjTZ2IkQ5L8sP3RekQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/21aea6464bea1b74e0df6dfceac462c5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Magazine", "body": "AMERICAN Noah Lyles has the chance to become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete an Olympic sprint double after qualifying for the 200m final at Paris 2024.\n\nLyles won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday.\n\nThe 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, finished second in his 200m semi-final in 20.08 seconds to Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nWorld 100m silver and 200m bronze medallist Tebogo set the fastest time of the round at Stade de France on Wednesday evening, clocking 19.96secs.\n\nThe Olympic men's 200m final takes place on Thursday at 19:30 BST.\n\nKenneth Bednarek, of the United States, also set a faster time than Lyles, in 20.00, while compatriot Erriyon Knighton, who upgraded to world 200m silver last year, also safely progressed.\n\nBut Canada's Andre de Grasse will not defend his title in the final after finishing third in his race (20.41).\n\nThe Olympic 200m bronze winner three years ago, Lyles claimed world 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold in Budapest last year.\n\nFollowing that achievement, when he became the first man since Bolt in 2015 to complete a 100m and 200m world double, he claimed he could look to add the 4x400m relay title to that treble haul in Paris.\n\nJamaican sprint legend Bolt completed individual sprint doubles at three successive Olympic Games among his eight titles, adding relay gold in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOnly nine men have achieved that double in the history of the Games.\n\nLyles became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004, with his narrow triumph.\n\nA three-time reigning world 200m champion, he will line up as favourite as he looks to further assert himself as the dominant male sprinter of the current generation.Media caption,\n\nGB's Anning makes final\n\nElsewhere during Wednesday's evening session, Great Britain's Amber Anning reached the final of the women's 400m.\n\nOlympic debutant Anning, 23, finished second in her semi-final in a personal best of 49.47.\n\nHowever, team-mates Laviai Nielsen (50.69) and Victoria Ohuruogu (51.14) missed out.\n\nIreland's Rhasidat Adeleke was among the other qualifiers for that final, which takes place on Friday at 19:00.\n\nTeam GB's Alastair Chalmers exited the men's 400m hurdles after suffering a fall in his semi-final.\n\nNorway's world record holder Karsten Warholm qualified fastest for the final in 47.67.\n\nTade Ojora was unable to reach the men's 110m hurdles final, finishing seventh in his heat.\n\nAmerican three-time world champion Grant Holloway recorded the fastest time in 12.98 as he seeks to upgrade his Tokyo silver. - bbcsport", "source": {"uri":

That would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with a long jump instead of the longer relay.\n\n\"It feels good to be out here,\" Lyles told reporters. \"It was in my head win the 120, win the 150, check around, win the heat.\"\n\nAsked what life had been like since his photo-finish victory, he said: \"I've been trying to get some sleep with my phone going off constantly. Right now I've got to rush over and get my medal.\"\n\nFollowing him home in 20.30 was defending champion Andre de Grasse of Canada, the last man to beat him.\n\nAmerican Kenny Bednarek, silver medallist ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and runner-up to him at the 2022 worlds, shut down early but still clocked the fastest time with 19.96.\n\nHe too went well in Sunday's 100m final, though his 9.88 was good enough only for seventh.\n\n\"I'm on a mission for this 200,\" he said. \"What happened yesterday happened. I'm taking it day by day.\"\n\nALSO READ | Paris 2024: Faith Kipyegon's 5000m silver medal reinstated after appeal\n\nErriyon Knighton, world championship silver and bronze medallist as a teenager, made sure there would be three Americans in the semi-finals by winning his heat in 19.99, the only other sub-20 time on a warm Paris evening.\n\nNow 20, Knighton will seek to deliver on the biggest stage after seemingly being the next big thing for years but never quite reaching the top step.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo, sixth in Sunday's 100m final in a national record 9.86 and a bronze medallist over 200m in last year's world championships, cruised his heat in 20.10.\n\nWayde van Niekerk, the 400m world record holder and former world championship silver medallist over 200m, made it as the third automatic qualifier from the first heat in 20.42 having opted the skip the one-lap event in Paris.\n\n\"The decision (to run only the 200) was purely based on getting back to a space of enjoying the sport,\" said the South African. \"Finding peace in a sport that has helped me so much.\n\n\"If I look at my performance so far, I'm obviously well off the top-tier guys.

The 27-year-old American sprinter, known for both his speed and his swagger, has voiced a bold new ambition: securing his own signature sneaker.\n\nLyles' victory on Sunday was a nail-biter, as he edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by just five-thousandths of a second. This win not only underscores his status as the world's fastest man but also sets the stage for his push into the commercial spotlight.\n\nAlready sponsored by Adidas, Lyles has captured attention with his on-track performances and charismatic personality. His latest triumph, coupled with a substantial $50,000 prize and a lucrative endorsement deal -- the richest for a sprinter since Usain Bolt -- puts him in a prime position to demand more.\n\n\"I want my own shoe. I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious,\" Lyles said, while at the Paris 2024 Olympics press conference. \"I want a sneaker; ain't no money in spikes. There's money in sneakers. Even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety we get, the fact that that hasn't happened is crazy to me. I was like, 'Yeah, that needs to happen.'\"\n\nLyles' call for a signature shoe highlights a broader issue within not just the track and field community, but Olympic athletes in general. By advocating for his own sneaker, Lyles is seeking personal gain but he's also aiming to pave the way for future Olympic stars, particularly in his own sport.\n\nAs he prepares to return to the track for the 200-meter race, Lyles is eyeing another milestone. He has the chance to become the first sprinter since Usain Bolt in 2016 to win both the 100-meter and 200-meter events at the same Olympics, a feat known as the \"double.\" This ambition follows his first double victory at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\nLyles' quest for a signature sneaker could revolutionize how track and field athletes are marketed and compensated. If successful, it would mark a significant shift, recognizing the commercial potential and star power of track athletes in a way that hasn't been fully realized before.\n\nAs Lyles continues to break records and push boundaries, his determination to secure a signature sneaker symbolizes his broader vision: transforming his athletic success into a lasting legacy both on and off the track.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_shoemaker@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Shoemaker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The 27-year-old is still looking for gold in the 200-meter sprint, which would make him the first man since Usain Bolt in the 2016 Rio Games to win both the 100-meter and 200-meter races, or what's known as the \"double.\"\n\nLyles is the heavy favorite to win the event -- his odds are at -460 on FanDuel Sportsbook -- as he's significantly more experienced in the 200-meter than in the 100-meter. His 200-meter accolades include three world championships, including the last two, and a bronze medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"The 200 is my wife, and the 100 is my mistress,\" Lyles said on the Netflix docuseries \"Sprint\" before winning the double in the 2023 World Athletics Championships.\n\nDouble or not, Lyles's win in the 100-meter, the most prestigious track event, solidifies his title as the fastest man in the world.\n\nComparisons between Bolt and Lyles are inevitable, and the American has declared that he wants to challenge Bolt's world-record times.\n\n\"He's the fastest man to ever do it, and soon it'll be me,\" Lyles told CNN in March.\n\nBut, like Bolt, Lyles also wants to impact the sport beyond the track. Bolt's dominance and longevity made him the face of the sport, but his bravado, which includes a signature pose, made him one of the world's most marketable athletes.\n\nLyles, from his shots at NBA players to showing Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before big races, has already shown the swagger to become a media focal point. The question now is how high he can go in a sport that only receives significant international fanfare every four years during the Olympics.\n\nAfter winning the 100-meter race on Sunday, Lyles, an Adidas athlete since 2016, told reporters that he wants his own signature shoe, particularly a training shoe and not a track-and-field spike.\n\n\"I want my own shoe. I want my own trainer. Dead serious. I want a sneaker, ain't no money in spikes. There's money in sneakers,\" Lyles said.\n\nIt may not be a coincidence that Lyles made his statement the day after Bolt launched a signature lifestyle shoe with Puma.\n\nAthletic brands often reserve their signature shoes for athletes in more accessible and marketable sports, particularly basketball. There are some other athletes with their own signature lines that come with lifestyle and training shoes, such as On with Roger Federer and Adidas with Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThose are two of the greatest athletes in their sport's history, so a shoe or clothing line would cement Lyles as the face of track and field.\n\n\"With today's win, and everything he has achieved in his career so far, Noah has cemented his greatness and place as one of the leading athletes in the world. We're proud to have been able to support him on every step of his journey since our partnership began in 2016,\" Adidas's general manager of running and credibility sports said in a statement after Sunday's race.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletic trainer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23910498_168392832_lowres.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

He had stunned the world at the 2024 Paris Olympics, winning the 200m and earning the gold medal over heavy favorite Noah Lyles of the United States.\n\nTebogo made all sorts of history by beating Lyles, who settled for the bronze medal, and silver medalist Kenny Bednarek. But for track and field enthusiasts, Tebogo's emergence wasn't completely unexpected.\n\nHe has been a rising star for a few years, even drawing comparisons to Usain Bolt prior to his introduction to an international audience on Thursday. He also beat Lyles Wednesday in the 200m semifinals - the first race Lyles had lost in the 200m since the Tokyo Olympics - in a precursor to what Tebogo pulled off in the final.\n\nHere's what else you should know about Tebogo now that he's known for dethroning Lyles in his signature event:\n\nTebogo was born in Kanye, Botswana, a village in the southern portion of the country. He moved to Botswana's capital city, Gaborone, in the seventh grade.\n\nLetsile Tebogo 200m history\n\nBy winning the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Tebogo became the first Olympic gold medal winner from Botswana and the first runner from Africa to win the 200m final at the Olympic Games. In 2023, he became the first African to win a medal in the 100m at the world championships.\n\n\"Africans can be sprinters, too,\" Tebogo declared to NBCSports.com in an interview before the Paris Games.\n\nLetsile Tebogo dedicated 2024 Paris Olympics to his mother\n\nTebogo's mother, Seratiwa, died in May from an illness and Tebogo said he dedicated his 200m gold medal win to her. Tebogo held up his shoe to the camera after the race, and it featured his mother's birthdate on it. He also painted her initials on his nails.\n\n\"I always think about her but I just try not to let it get into me that much and then just block it out and move forward,\" Tebogo said last week.\n\n\"I believe there is a medal in these legs and it only needs the determination and the willpower to do it,\" he added. \"I've had such a huge blow that affected me deeply so I'm still trying to get the confidence back into the body. It's not about injuries, it is all about my mum.\"\n\nLetsile Tebogo-Usain Bolt comparison, explained\n\nIn 2022, at the U20 world championships in Columbia, Tebogo set a world junior record in winning the 100m gold medal in 9.91 seconds. He was far enough ahead in the final stretch that he turned around to gesture and smile at his nearest competitors. Tebogo later explained it was a tribute to Bolt as opposed to showboating.\n\n\"If somebody took it as disrespect, I'm really sorry,\" Tebogo said at the time, according to Reuters. \"(It was so) everybody watching at home can enjoy the race - to remind them a little bit about what Usain Bolt did back in the day. He's my idol - the person I look up to.\"\n\nThe display quickly drew comparisons to Bolt on social media and Bolt even retweeted a post featuring Tebogo's finish.\n\nLetsile Tebogo used to train without shoes\n\n\"I used to train without shoes,\" Tebogo told NBCSports.com. \"Shoes were more expensive and we couldn't afford that because we lived with our extended family, so it was difficult for us to get things. [If you did], it would be as if you were the favored child, so things had to be equal. So I used to train without shoes in both football and athletics. I would wear a pair of old pants that one of my uncles used to wear back when he was in school.

I tested positive around 5am on Tuesday morning. Woke up in the middle of the night feeling chills, aching, sore throat and those were a lot of the symptoms I've always had right before getting Covid.\n\n\"We tested it and it came back positive so we quickly quarantined in a hotel near the village and get me on as much medication as we legally could to make sure that my body was able to keep the momentum going.\n\n\"I still wanted to run, we decided it was still possible, so we just stayed away from everybody and tried to take it round by round. I knew if I wanted to come out here and win I would have to give everything I've had from the get go. I didn't have any time to save energy. That was the strategy.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance. I am more proud of myself than anything. Coming out and getting the bronze medal with Covid.\n\n\"We tried to keep it close to our chest. The medical staff, my coach and my mum knew.\n\n\"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic. We wanted to be able to compete. We wanted to be able to make it discreet as possible and you don't want to tell your competitors you are sick.\n\n\"Why would you give them an edge?\"\n\nThe American world champion at the distance was hoping to become the first man since Usain Bolt at the Rio 2016 Games to secure both the 100m and 200m titles.\n\nHe had managed to bounce back to win 100m gold in Paris, but this time could not compensate for what was again the slowest reaction time of the pack.\n\nTebogo crossed in 19.46 for his first Olympic title and the United States' Kenny Bednarek snapped up silver.\n\nLyles was slowest off the blocks in 0.173 seconds but had clawed his way up to third by the 20- metre mark and remained in bronze medal position for the rest of the race, finishing in 19.70.\n\nTebogo and Bednarek battled for their positions, the American holding the lead just after the halfway point, but it was the Botswanan's race to lose from the 120 metres mark and he never looked close to letting go.\n\nTebogo (21) became the first man from his country to win an Olympic 200 metres final and dedicated the medal to his mother, Elizabeth Seratiwa, who passed away last May.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 8 Aug 2024, 9:34 PM Last updated: Thu 8 Aug 2024, 9:51 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=06263334-31c3-564f-a491-867a7d6b5f36&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99852&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

His place on the podium was a shock, until shortly after the race he was seen being tended to by medical staff and taken off in a wheelchair. The first thought was that he may have run through an injury, but the reality was he ran while ill from COVID.\n\nLyles tested positive a few days ago and described attempting to quarantine to the best of his ability leading up to the 200-meter. He did not break any Olympic protocols by participating in the event. Teams and individuals are able to participate at their discretion even if COVID positive in 2024 after restrictions for the past two Games.\n\nThe main reason Lyles opted to race, despite the illness, was resilience. He spoke after the race about how he was proud of being able to come out to participate despite the circumstances.\n\n\"My first thought [after testing positive] was not to panic, thinking I've been in worse situations, I've run with worse conditions, and we just took it day by day, trying to hydrate, quarantined off. It's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get a bronze medal.\"\n\nHis medal, the same one he achieved last Olympics, feels much different this time around:\n\n\"It's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal where last Olympic I was very disappointed, and this time I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nAsked if he ever considered not running, he said: \"No. No, I didn't.

Get the gold medal, right?'\"\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics. It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.

Obviously I hoped to do better and expected to do better, I wish I'd done better, I let myself down but that's the emotions. I'm sure in a couple of days, maybe a couple of hours I'll be able to look back on that Olympic experience. I've come here and I've accomplished a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "wandsworthguardian.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wandsworth Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ogando", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Ogando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fahnbulleh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Fahnbulleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurdling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Botswana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tade_Ojora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tade Ojora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsten_Warholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karsten Warholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.wandsworthguardian.co.uk/resources/images/18397504/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The 27-year-old American could become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete an Olympic sprint double if he picks up gold in the 200m final.\n\nHe won 100m gold by five-thousandths of a second from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a dramatic photo finish on Sunday. The 27-year-old, winner of three golds at last year's World Championships, became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title for 20 years, since Justin Gatlin in 2004.\n\nAlong with the medal, he'll also be aiming to smash Bolt's long-standing 200m world record of 19.19 seconds - further cementing his name in the history books.\n\nREAD MORE: Team GB star Keely Hodgkinson's tumour battle, not being a 'one-hit wonder' and dreaming of gold\n\nLyles is also expected to participate in the men's 4\u00d7100 metres relay final, and has openly advocated for a spot on the men's 4\u00d7400 team as well, in a bid to achieve something Bolt never did by winning four golds in one Games.\n\nRead on to find out more about the star.\n\nEarly life in Florida and track success\n\nNoah Lyles was born on July 18, 1997 in Gainesville, Florida to parents Kevin Lyles and Keisha Caine. He has a sister called Abby and a brother called Josephus, who is also an athlete.\n\nHe was a gymnast in his youth and started track and field at age 12, first taking up the high jump before switching to sprints. He's said of his sporting prowess: \"I was born into this sport. Me and my younger brother Josephus got into it together through our parents who used to run.\n\n\"We have always been surrounded by track. Track was what I loved from the start. If I can be on a track, then I can be happy. It always saved me.\"\n\nSince turning professional in July 2016, he has notched up an impressive string of accolades, including Olympic bronze, six world titles, and four Diamond League Final trophies. At the 2023 World Championship in Budapest he retained his 200m crown from 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn the process, he claimed a rare sprint treble, winning gold in the 100m, 200m, and the 4x100m relay - the first man to do so since Usain Bolt in 2015.\n\nMental health struggles\n\nLyles has been open with his struggles with mental health - a subject that other athletes have previously been reluctant to open up about. In August 2020, he said in a tweet that he had started to take antidepressant medication.\n\nHe later shared that his struggles began during a two-month stay in Europe for training and competition before the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar - the prolonged period away from home leading to homesickness and depression. He said he was reluctant to continue training and family members noticed signs of distress during a Christmas visit.\n\nHe's said of this time in his life: \"So that's when I started ringing my personal therapist on a regular basis, and it was going well for a time, but once coronavirus hit and the Black Lives Matter movement started happening, it created the perfect storm. I didn't feel like it was very hard to share, as I'm constantly talking about mental health.\"\n\nLyles flew to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics with the 2019 world 200m title under his belt and was the favourite to become the first American to claim gold in that event since 2004. Instead, he finished third in a stadium that was near-empty stadium as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about his lifelong battle with anxiety and depression and the difficulty of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform - ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nBefore heading to Paris he said: \"I get to finally say, I'm showing up to an Olympic Games not depressed and it feels amazing. It's a lot of joy, a lot of joy, even though there's hard times in the moment I can always think back to the last Olympics and be like, 'no, this one is not the same'. This one is way better and I'm ready to show it.\n\n\"If I lose this time, it's not going to be because I beat myself, it's just gonna be that they had to be that much better. But to be honest, when Noah Lyles is being Noah Lyles - nobody (can).\"\n\nDealing with superstardom in Paris\n\nLyles has not shied away from courting attention, declaring his intent on recently-released Netflix documentary Sprint to become the face of his sport and elevate athletics' appeal in the process. He freely admits he's showman who performs better in front of a full house.\n\nHe said he remembers the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself \"it's showtime\", but instead found himself thinking \"this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted\".\n\nHe says that \"the line between confidence and cocky can be so blurred\" but brushes off anyone who might not fully understand his \"vision\", his signature bravado mitigated by memories of being the dyslexic kid with asthma, who struggled in school and was told he would never achieve his athletic ambitions.\n\nIn Paris he is one of the most recognisable faces in the Olympic athletes' village and has spoken about the difficulties of managing his mental health with his new echelon of fame.\n\nHe said: \"I've become kind of popular in the village. Unfortunately, that has come with its own set of challenges in being able to find my own space whether that's eating or training in the gym. I know some athletes like to leave the village and have their own hotels but I like to enjoy the whole Olympic event, being with other athletes and stuff like that, but it has come with its own challenge of, you know, finding my own safe place.\n\n\"It's been kind of hard for me to find that within the village and I don't want to leave. It's definitely something I feel like after this Olympics, I'm gonna have to have conversations higher up than me, and whoever is in charge of that, making that more available or just more aware, because I'm not even the most popular person in the village.\n\n\"I know I'm not the only one who's had to deal with situations like this, and I just talked about that to bring that to people's attention. We might be superstars in your eyes, we still are human beings, and we do want to be able to have our space and our time.\"\n\nFashion, love for LEGO and life outside sport\n\nThe sports star's official Paris Olympics profile notes that his hobbies include \"painting (especially shoes), watching anime, making music and building complex LEGO creations\". The fashion-forward star has walked the runway at Paris and Milan Fashion Weeks and likes to paint his nails to mark the big occasions and wears themed necklaces to match his hair.\n\nIn an interview in 2018, ahead of the Birmingham Diamond League, he said: \"I have a lot of interests and art is my biggest love. Lego is another one. I have a whole Lego city that I'm building piece by piece and brick by brick and box by box and people actually like it.\"\n\nBut when asked if there was anything he couldn't do, Lyles admitted: \"I'm not actually that good at traditional learning. Or math or writing. I actually have dyslexia, which actually makes things hard for me and people see in my tweets that I spell things wrong.\"\n\nHe said he uses an app to help him get his spelling right but added: \"There's different words so I might end up putting a wrong word so the grammar is off. I do have my limits.\"\n\nStar wants his own shoe\n\nAsked what he wants next, Lyles told interviewers: \"I want my own shoe\". He added: \"I want my own trainer -- I'm dead serious. There ain't no money in spikes, it's in sneakers.\n\n\"And even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker. I feel like for how many medals we bring back, for the notoriety we get ... the fact that that hasn't happened, that's crazy to me. I was like, 'Yeah, that needs to happen.' \"\n\nThe new Usain Bolt?\n\nLyles has long been an admirer of retired sprint superstar Usain Bolt but has expressed his desire to break the Jamaican's longstanding records in the 100m and 200m events.\n\nHe said last year: \"I've always known that I'm the fastest man in the world. Well, in my head, I think I'm going to break it. I'm planning to break it.\"\n\nHis profile is on track to be as big as Bolt's- with a beaming smile and personality to match - but Lyles is adamant that he isn't the next Bolt. The two stars met after a race in Bolt's homeland of Jamaica last year, with Lyles saying the star was nothing but encouraging to him.\n\nHe said: \"Bolt coming down and giving me his respects and me giving him my respects, it was kind of like, 'Wow', He said, 'Just keep doing what you are doing'.\"\n\nHowever Lyles is firmly his own man, saying: \"I am the new Noah Lyles.\"\n\nPersonal life and romance\n\nNoah Lyles' girlfriend is Jamaican track star Junelle Bloomfield, who's also an Olympian. The couple, who are both representing their countries at the Paris Olympics 2024, celebrated their second anniversary during the Games.\n\nThey first met through social media in 2017 but did not pursue their relationship after sparks failed to fly on their first date. According to Cosmopolitan, Bromfield originally reached out to Lyles via Instagram in 2017.\n\nLyles then contacted Bromfield again and asked for a second chance and they went Instagram official in December 2022. They now live together in Florida.\n\nThe men's 200m final will take place at the Saint Denis stadium at 7.30pm on Thursday night. It will be broadcast live on BBC One.\n\nThis year, the Olympics runs from July 26 to August 11. As usual, a number of events are being screened across the BBC - whilst the schedule will be further rolled out through streaming platform Discovery+.", "source": {"uri":

After winning gold in Sunday's 100 metres in the tightest of photo finishes, the highly confident Lyles has backed himself to finish first again.\n\n\"None of them is winning,\" he said of his competitors. \"When I come off the turn, they're gonna be depressed.\"\n\nLyles, 27, has long been a 200-metre specialist, winning gold in the Youth Olympics a decade ago. His personal best of 19.31 seconds, recorded in 2022 when he won his second of three golds in the World Athletics Championships, is the third-fastest time ever, and more than a tenth of a second faster than any of his Paris rivals.\n\nBolt, the retired Jamaican sprinter, set the 200-metre world record of 19.19 seconds in 2009 -- and Lyles has been clear about his intention to break it. After making the US team in June, he said he had set himself two goals: \"Grabbing an Olympic gold, and then\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009grabbing a world record. It's on the list.\"\n\nLyles has overcome adversity in his return to prominence on track and field's biggest stages. He struggled with depression during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic and finished third in the 200 metres at the 2021 Tokyo Games.\n\nHe has since been on a mission to re-establish himself as the world's best sprinter, while also leaning into his role of pot-stirrer in an effort to boost athletics' media profile and the prize money on offer as a new crop of investors vies to reshape the sport.\n\nA star of the recent Netflix documentary series Sprint, Lyles has taken aim at US stars in sports such as basketball who proclaim themselves \"world champions\" for winning domestic league titles.\n\n\"You know what hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head. World champion of what? The United States?\" he said after winning the sprint double at the 2023 World Championships. \"I love the US, at times, but that is not the world.\"\n\nA win for Lyles in the 200-metre final would offer him a bigger platform to air his views. Rivals include his compatriot Erriyon Knighton, who has a personal best of 19.49 seconds, and Botswana's Letsile Tebogo with 19.50.\n\nIn Lyles's dramatic photo-finish victory in the 100-metre race, he edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by a mere five-thousandths of a second.\n\nJamaica, which has become a sprinting powerhouse in recent decades with the rise of Bolt and other athletes, has had a disappointing Games -- winning only one athletics gold so far, in men's discus. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson withdrew from the 100-metre and 200-metre women's races respectively, the latter having already pulled out of the shorter-distance event before the Games began.\n\nUS sprinter Gabby Thomas won the women's 200 metres on Tuesday. Reflecting Lyles's motivational qualities, Thomas said she was partly inspired by her male counterpart's performance in the 100 metres.\n\n\"Hearing Noah go after what he wanted and take it, I knew that if I were in any position in this race, I could still go after it and take [the gold],\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors":

Lyles also placed second in his semifinal heat in the 100-meter event before taking home the gold in the final.\n\nWith a win Thursday, the U.S. track star can become the first sprinter since Usain Bolt in 2016 to take gold in both the 100 and 200-meter races, known as the prestigious \"double.\"\n\nLyles solidified his spot as one of the most marketable Olympians after winning the 100-meter sprint Sunday. But the Adidas-backed sprinter declared he wants a signature shoe, an accomplishment saved for some of the top athletes in major sports, including Bolt. Achieving the \"double\" would improve Lyles's case, especially given his marketable, albeit polarizing, personality.\n\n\"I want my own shoe. I want my own trainer. I'm dead serious.\" Lyles told reporters in Paris. \"I want a sneaker. There ain't no money in spikes. There's money in sneakers. And even Michael Johnson didn't have his own sneaker.\"\n\nLyles was direct about his desire for a signature shoe, but he never once mentioned Adidas during his press conference.\n\nWhile athletes are allowed to secure personal sponsorships anytime during the Games, the IOC's Rule 40 severely limits the amount of public interaction Olympic athletes can have with any non-Olympic partners, like Adidas.\n\nAn example of how granular Rule 40 can be is that an athlete can thank each personal sponsor only once during the entirety of the Games.\n\n\"During the Games Period, you may provide one simple 'thank-you' message to each of your Non-Olympic Partner personal sponsors,\" the Rule 40 FAQ states.\n\nNike is also the national team sponsor for the U.S., which is why Lyles sports the Swoosh on his tracksuit despite wearing Adidas racers.\n\nA signature shoe would be another step in Lyles's journey to grow and transcend the sport.\n\nLyles was the main subject of the Netflix docuseries Sprint, released last month, and said it was \"amazing\" in giving fans a deeper look into the track and field. But he hopes the sport can amass attention beyond the Olympics.\n\n\"I want to see a continuation of the ability to take advantage of moments for our sport,\" Lyles said in Paris. \"This needs to be accessible because this is a world sport, so we need to be able to show it to the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23937139_168392832_lowres-scaled-e1723056423512.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

I'd definitely say it's taken its toll, for sure.\n\n\"But I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get a bronze medal.\"\n\n\"I didn't [consider not running]. I was set. We were going to try and quarantine as much has possible, stay away, not try to pass it on, and give it my all.\n\n\"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100 per cent but I would definitely say I'm closer to 90 to 95 per cent.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this as close to the chest as possible.\n\n\"You never want to tell your competitors you're sick; why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nThere are no specific rules at Paris 2024 regarding protocols for athletes who tested positive.\n\nLast week, British swimming superstar Adam Peaty tested positive and was separated from the rest of the team, but swam in the relay six days later.\n\nThere had been rumours of Lyles receiving medical treatment during the week, but few people seemed to know the whole truth, and when Lyles exploded out onto the track, the last man introduced to the crowd, it seemed he was more than confident of repeating his feat from the World Championships last year.\n\nBut he had been wearing a medical mask in the call room, where the athletes wait to go to the track, and by the final 20 metres it became clear that all was not well with Lyles.\n\nUsually the quickest over the second 100 metres of the race, he failed to make any indent on the lead of Tebogo and USA teammate Bednarek.\n\n\"I don't care [if he had Covid],\" Bednarek said.\n\n\"If I get sick or whatever, I'm fine. If it's a cold or... I don't view those things as a big deal.\"\n\nBoth men were due to be involved in the 4x100m relay final this weekend, although Lyles hinted he may sit it out.\n\n\"At the moment I don't know,\" Lyles added.\n\n\"I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing. They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me.\"\n\nEllie Aldridge was only too happy to rescue the Olympic regatta for Team GB by soaring to gold in the inaugural women's kite event on an up-and-down Thursday in France.\n\nThe 27-year-old beat Lauriane Nolot to top spot after the French favourite fell off her board in the early stages of the final in Marseille.\n\nNolot won gold and Aldridge silver at the last two World Championships and at the Test Event, but the Dorset native delivered at the big dance and took the first-ever kite title, with her rival settling for second place.\n\n\"I knew that if I had the right week I could win but it was going to need everything to align,\" said Aldridge.\n\n\"I felt like at the beginning of the week I didn't have great luck, but I feel like my luck came around a bit.\n\n\"We haven't had the easiest conditions but it's been really cool and I hope everyone watching on TV thinks the same thing. It's been incredible.\"\n\nThe sigh of relief breathed by British sailing bosses when Aldridge crossed the line first was almost audible from Paris.\n\nBefore her dramatic victory, the Games had only yielded one medal for Team GB in the shape of bronze for Emma Wilson.\n\nEven then Wilson was disconsolate at the colour of her medal after she dominated the event, winning eight of 14 races, before scores were wiped and she finished third in the final.\n\nBoth Micky Beckett and the pairing of John Gimson and Anna Burnet had podium chances heading into their final races, but crashed and burned in the double-points contest.\n\nAt the athletics track, Katarina Johnson-Thompson hailed her \"best day in a long time\" after surging to the women's heptathlon summit in pursuit of her maiden Olympic medal.\n\nThe 31-year-old added more than 50cm to her shot put lifetime best and recorded her best high jump performance since 2019 to hold the overnight lead ahead of reigning champion Nafi Thiam.\n\nThe pair are separated by just 48 points heading into Friday's conclusion, with long jump and javelin taking place in the morning before the 800m rounds things off from 7.15pm.\n\nAlso at Stade de France, Laura Muir and Georgia Bell made it through to the women's 1500m final.\n\nAt the velodrome, Emma Finucane added keirin bronze to her team sprint gold as the cycling medals continued to flow.\n\nRacing alongside fellow team sprint gold medallist Katy Marchant, Finucane tried to go from a long way out to surprise reigning world champion Ellesse Andrews of New Zealand.\n\nBut the Kiwi has made this most unpredictable of events her forte, and was too strong for Finucane, with the Netherlands' Hetty van de Wouw pipping Finucane to silver.\n\nAt the Grand Palais, Jade Jones denied ever taking performance-enhancing drugs just months after she was cleared to compete at the Olympics despite a missed doping test.\n\nThe double gold medallist was suspended pending further investigation earlier this year after failing to provide a sample to a doping control officer on 1 December.\n\nA missed test is normally treated the same as a failed one but Jones escaped sanction after being found to having committed a no-fault doping violation on confidential medical grounds.\n\nShe lost in the first round here, while teammate Bradly Sinden had to pull out of his bronze medal match due to a knee injury he suffered in his quarter-final bout.\n\nThe 68kg fighter, who won Olympic silver in Tokyo three years ago, fears he has torn the medial cruciate ligament in his left knee and was unable to take on China's Liang Yushuai in the third-place play-off.\n\nMeanwhile, there was disappointment for divers Jack Laugher and Jordan Houlden in the men's 3m springboard final.\n\nHoulden finished fifth, while four-time Olympic medallist Laugher finished seventh.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I will say this.

Breakout star Noah Lyles will be in the spotlight again as he bids to add to the 100m gold he's already secured.\n\n.The 27-year-old American claimed 100 metres gold by five one thousandths of a second on Sunday night. He needed to finish in the top two from semi-final heat two to automatically book his place in the 200m final - crossing the line in 20.08 seconds for second spot behind Botswanan Letsile Tebogo in 19.96.\n\nTeam GB won't be represented in the final but Lyles will face compatriots Erriyon Knighton and Kenneth Bednarek. The rest of the field is Tapiwanashe Makarawu and Makanakaishe Charamba (both of Zimbabwe), Alexander Ogando (Dominican Republic), Letsile Tobogo (Botswana) and Joseph Fahnbulleh (Liberia).\n\nREAD MORE: Team GB star Keely Hodgkinson's tumour battle, not being a 'one-hit wonder' and dreaming of gold\n\nLyles is also expected to participate in the men's 4\u00d7100 metres relay, and has openly advocated for a spot on the men's 4\u00d7400 team as well, in a bid to achieve something Jamaican eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt never did by winning four golds in one Games.\n\nHe is in Paris with a point to prove after becoming embroiled in a debate before the Games about who was currently fastest man on the planet. The world 100m and 200m champion's 100m triumph came three summers after he entered the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics as the 200m favourite and world champion - but only claimed bronze.\n\nAfterwards, he opened up about a lifelong battle with depression and the challenges of balancing the benefits of antidepressant medication with side effects that led to weight gain and affected his ability to perform - ultimately electing to wean off the treatment before those Games.\n\nHe has since acknowledged that he performs better in front of a full house, remembering the moment on the start line in Tokyo when he would usually say to himself \"it's showtime\". He said he instead found himself thinking \"this is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.\"\n\nThe men's 200m final will take place at the Saint Denis stadium at 7.30pm on Thursday night. It will be broadcast live on BBC One.\n\nThis year, the Olympics runs from July 26 to August 11. As usual, a number of events are being screened across the BBC - whilst the schedule will be further rolled out through streaming platform Discovery+.", "source": {"uri":

9.79 seconds, finished second in his semifinal behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nTebogo, also a finalist in the 100m, struck a psychological blow to Lyles, crossing the line in 19.96sec, while Lyles timed 20.08sec.\n\nAmerica's Kenny Bednaraek, the second-fastest in the world this year over the distance, clocked 20.00sec to edge out Alexander Ogando of the Dominican Republic in the first semi-final.\n\nErriyon Knighton of the US, a silver and bronze medallist over 200m at the past two world championships, qualified first from the third semi-final, clocking 20.09, ahead of Liberia's Joseph Fahnbulleh.\n\nThe two next-fastest qualifiers were Zimbabwe's Makanakaishe Charamba and compatriot Tapiwanashe Makarawu, meaning defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse does not qualify.\n\nThe two next-fastest qualifiers were Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu and his compatriot Makanakaishe Charamba, meaning defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse does not qualify after a

women's team pursuit gold\n\nJamaican sprint star Shericka Jackson withdrew from the women's 100m and then pulled out of her 200m heat.\n\nSt Lucia's Julien Alfred, pursuing the women's sprint double, came second behind Gabby Thomas in the 200m after winning the shorter sprint.\n\nLyles, the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallist, has been dominant in his preferred 200m, winning the past three world titles.\n\nHe is the third-fastest half-lap runner in history, with his mark of 19.31sec set at the world championships in Oregon in 2022 ranking behind only Jamaica's Yohan Blake and Bolt's world record of 19.19sec.\n\nRetired Jamaican sprint superstar Bolt did the 100m-200m sprint double at three consecutive Games -- Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, adding the 4x100m gold in London and Rio.\n\nThe first round of the sprint relay is on Thursday morning but Lyles is likely to be rested following his 200m semi-final.\n\nLatest on SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Noah Lyles cruises into

There are no strict protocols or restrictions for COVID-19 in Paris, though Anne Descamps, Paris 2024 chief communications director, told Reuters \"any athlete that has tested positive has to wear a mask.\" She also said they \"remind everyone to follow best practices but in terms of monitoring COVID, cases are quite low in France.\" Scientific American also reported officials in Paris dropped past Olympic protocols and were \"approaching the disease like other respiratory illnesses,\" adding officials were letting athletes and teams determine how best to prevent or respond to infection.\n\n\"I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here,\" Lyles told NBC after the race. \"And, getting a bronze medal, where last Olympics I was very disappointed ... this time I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nLyles had been seeking the gold in the 200 meter to be the first American male to complete the Olympic Double -- winning gold in both the 100 and 200 meter dash -- since 1984.\n\nLyles, 27, made his Olympic debut in Tokyo, where he earned a bronze medal in the 200 meter race.

Last year, however, that put him at odds with some of the most high-profile basketball players in the NBA.\n\nAt last year's world championships, Lyles won the 100-meter and 200-meter races - a double he's trying to repeat in the Olympics on Thursday night after winning the 100m on Sunday - and wasn't shy about comparing his accomplishments to those of his professional basketball counterparts back in the US.\n\nWhen speaking to reporters at the World Championships in Budapest, Lyles was asked about what he wanted to do for track and field and what he'd like to see to improve the sport's profile.\n\nLyles said the medals he wins are the first step to raising track's awareness in the public's eye and that he wants more former world champions to be present at high-profile meets. And then he took a turn into taking a shot at the NBA.\n\n\"You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on they head. World champion of what? The United States? Don't get me wrong, I love the US - at times - but that ain't the world,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA.\"\n\nLyles' comment hit on something that sports fans in the rest of the world often mock about US sports culture. In almost every major American sport, the champion of the league is referred to as the world champion, even though those teams only play against other franchises that are based in either the US or Canada.\n\nBut the US' distinct sporting culture means that the four major American sports - football, basketball, baseball and hockey - are head and shoulders above those sports' domestic leagues in other nations. Most of the best players from around the world in those sports end up playing for American teams, hence the claim to the title of world champion: case and point, the last six NBA MVP awards went to players who were born abroad.\n\nLyles' comment was not welcomed by the American NBA players who he had called out.\n\nTwo-time NBA champion and 2014 MVP Kevin Durant, who has also been named Finals MVP twice in his illustrious career, led the charge.\n\n\"Somebody help this brother,\" he wrote on Instagram, responding to an ESPN post.\n\nFour-time NBA champion Draymond Green also got involved, writing on Instagram, \"When being smart goes wrong\" with the face-palm emoji. Devin Booker, who plays on Team USA in these Olympics and the Phoenix Suns, just simply posted a facepalm emoji.\n\nSo if Lyles ends up winning the 100m-200m double, don't expect very many American NBA players to be celebrating publicly.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_church@cnn.com", "name": "Ben Church", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kyle_feldscher@cnn.com", "name": "Kyle Feldscher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice Hockey World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2165276300-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Canada is the only other country with multiple golds with two. In terms of total track and field medals, the next closest country is Australia with six.\n\nThe USA stands to widen the gap today, Thursday, Aug. 9, as it's favored in three of five medal events.\n\nAt top sportsbook sites, Noah Lyles sits atop the odds board for the 200m sprint (2:30 p.m. ET), Grant Holloway favored in the men's 110m hurdles (3:45 p.m. ET), and Sydney McLaughlin owns the shortest price in the women's 400m hurdles (3:25 p.m. ET).\n\nIn the 100m race last week, bettors were able to find good value on Lyles after he failed to post the top time in the heats or semifinals. Such value is not to be had in the 200m, even though Lyles didn't win his semifinal; instead, he coasted to an easy finish, knowing he would qualify and was still within .14 seconds of the top time.\n\nWhile Lyles is -500 at DraftKings, bettors are offered -450 at Bet365.\n\nHere are Bet365's for the men's 200m today at the Paris Games.\n\nBet365 offers several other markets on this event, such as matchups, the 200m without Lyles and yes/no on a podium finish.\n\nAlso check: Top sports betting apps | Best sportsbook promos\n\nThe United States and Jamaica dominated the 200m at four straight Olympics until the 2020 Tokyo Games (held in 2021), when Andre De Grasse of Canada won gold. In 2024, though, De Grasse ran a 20.41 in the semifinals and failed to qualify for the final, guaranteeing a new gold medalist in this event.\n\nIn Tokyo, American Kenneth Bednarek won silver, and Lyles won bronze. Both are in today's final. While the price for Lyles to win is prohibitively short, odds on the other two Americans to medal -- Bednarek and Erriyon Knighton could present value. At Bet365, Kenneth Bednarek is -300 to medal, and Erriyon Knighton is +162 to medal.\n\nComing into the Olympics, Lyles owned the year's fastest 200m in the world, posting a 19.53 at the US Olympic team trials. Bednarek ran the second-fastest with a 19.59 at the same event. Knighton's 19.77 is the sixth fastest. Of the athletes to make the finals, those times are three of the top four, with Letsile Tebogo owning the third-fastest with a 19.71 back in April.\n\nWith Lyles, Bednarek and Knighton, the United States could realistically sweep the 200m.\n\nOdds boost at Bet365: Bednarek to win gold +850\n\nWhile we predict that Lyles will win gold and Bednarek should medal as well, neither holds strong enough value to make a bet on it. There is solid value, though, for Erriyon Knighton to medal with +162 odds at Bet365.\n\nKnighton won his 200m heat with a 19.99 and won his semifinal with a 20.09. He was not pushed in either and coasted to the finish each time. Expect him to step up to the challenge in the final, finding his way onto the podium.\n\nGrant Holloway is almost assured of winning the 110m hurdles if he has a clean race, but betting on him is not worth the value with odds of -1400 at DraftKings.\n\nYou can bet on Daniel Roberts to earn a podium finish at Bet365 with odds at -118. Roberts has the third-fastest time in the world this year with a 12.96 and the third-fastest time in the semifinals with a 13.10. USA's Freddie Crittenden is +190 for a podium finish at +190, but has been dealing with a minor injury, which is why we like Roberts a little more.\n\nSimilar to the men's 110m hurdles, Sydney McLaughlin is too heavy of a favorite to have good betting value with -400 odds at Bet365. American Anna Cockrell, with +250 odds at DraftKings to win a medal, is better value. She came in third in the semifinals with a 52.90 and has the fourth-fastest time in the world this year with a 52.64 at the US Olympic team trials.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType":

Kenny Bednarek took silver, while 100m champion Noah Lyles finished third as US Track & Field confirmed he had been suffering from Covid.\n\nBotswana only had two previous medals of any colour. Nijel Amos won silver in the 800m in London in 2012, while the African nation secured bronze in the 4x400m relay in Tokyo.\n\nTebogo's sister was in the stands at the Stade de France to watch the 21-year-old come home in first place. And, after posting the fastest time in the world in 2024, he spoke about his family's loss.\n\n\"It's basically me carrying her through every stride that I take inside the field,\" he said. \"She's watching up there, and she's really, really happy.\"\n\nTebogo also posted a national record in the 100m final, but his time of 9.86 was only enough for sixth on that occasion. He was the fastest man in the 200m semis, though, and made sure in the final.\n\n\"My coach has told me just now, 'now it's your race, you can do whatever you want. It's either a medal or not, I don't care - you made it through after all you have been through, making it to the final, I'm the happiest coach ever',\" Tebogo told Eurosport. \"So for me this is a really amazing moment for myself.\n\nHow impressed were you with Letsile Tebogo's win? Let us know in the comments section\n\n\"Before the race, when I was walking to the call room, he just told me 'I think it's now best we just do what we did in London when we ran the African record',\" Tebogo added. \"When the gun went, I knew Kenny was going to run away so make sure, just close him down, because I have that top-end speed that will allow me to be in the race without getting tired.\n\n\"So that's what I did, and when I saw [Bednarek] fade I knew Noah was far away behind us. So that means I'm the Olympic champion.\n\n\"It really means a lot to my late mum because she always dreamt of making it here. I think my little sister is in the stands, I don't know where she's sitting but I believe she's happy, she's representing her while she's here. So it means a lot for everybody - the country, the continent, and my family at large.\"\n\nIt later emerged that bronze medalist Lyles had been suffering with Covid after waking up with chills on Tuesday morning US Track and field said in a statement that it - along with the US Olympic and Paralymic Committee, had \"enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete,\" the USTF's statement continued. \"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\n\n\"As an organization, we are rigorously adhering to CDC, USOpc, and IOC guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nKeep up with the latest Olympic coverage with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

But it was going to be really tough to try to come away with a fast time, because of course these guys are running the Olympics.'\n\nSouth Africa's Wayde van Niekerk, the 400m Olympic champion at the 2016 Rio Games and world record holder at the distance, missed out on the 200m final, with his decision to step down to the shorter sprint failing to pay off.\n\n'I'm a competitor, I won medals and I'm not happy with where I am at the moment,' said Van Niekerk, 32.\n\nTreble-chasing Lyles has the chance to be the standout star of the athletics programme in Paris.\n\nJamaican sprint star Shericka Jackson withdrew from the women's 100m and then pulled out of her 200m heat.\n\nSt Lucia's Julien Alfred, pursuing the women's sprint double, came second behind Gabby Thomas in the 200m after winning the shorter sprint.\n\nLyles, the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallist, has been dominant in his preferred 200m, winning the past three world titles.\n\nHe is the third-fastest half-lap runner in history, with his mark of 19.31sec set at the world championships in Oregon in 2022 ranking behind only Jamaica's Yohan Blake and Bolt's world record of 19.19sec.\n\nRetired Jamaican sprint superstar Bolt did the 100m-200m sprint double at three consecutive Games -- Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, adding the 4x100m gold in London and Rio.\n\nThe first round of the sprint relay is on Thursday morning

Rates of infection are rising across 84 countries, according to the World Health Organization. And amid an invigorating Olympics games, even the most elite of us all are not immune.\n\nAfter scoring bronze in the 200-meter finals Thursday, American sprinter Noah Lyles confirmed he tested positive for COVID two days prior. He's among dozens of other athletes who have tested positive during the Game. He had not disclosed his diagnosis to his teammates, he told the Olympics broadcaster NBC after the race.\n\n\"We were trying to keep this as close to the chest as possible,\" Lyles, wearing a mask, tells journalists following the race, according to NBC. \"You never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge over you?\"\n\nAccording to NBC's live update reporting, Lyles confided in his coach, medical staff, and family, and made the decision to stay in the race because it was his \"one shot.\" Unlike the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, officials were not strict on COVID protocol this time around and left competing with the respiratory virus up to the athletes and their staff.\n\n\"I knew if I wanted to come out here and win, I had to give everything I had from the get-go. I didn't have any time to save energy, so that was kind of the strategy for today,\" he tells reporters at the games. \"This is by far the best day I felt out of the last three days. I still wouldn't say I'm 100% but I would definitely say I'm closer to like, 90 to 95%.\"\n\nStill, it feels like quite the head-turner after years of intense COVID protocols. Many have taken their opinions online, critiquing the sprinter for competing with the heavily contagious illness. One simply asks what everyone's thinking: \"You are allowed to compete if you have covid?\" An epidemiologist commented on the news headline on Instagram, saying, \"This is not something to celebrate. Putting other athletes' (+ coaches, staff, fans, etc) health at risk is not OK.\" No matter people's illness severity, COVID is still highly contagious, experts have previously told Fortune.\n\nOlympians with underlying conditions, including Lyles, who has asthma, may be at an increased risk for complications from COVID. And people with mild cases may still also have reduced performance. The few who develop long COVID can also experience reduced exercise capacity. After Lyles completed his race, he fell to the ground and received assistance into a wheelchair to be led off the track.\n\nLater, Lyles reported having minor symptoms of COVID, saying he felt \"quite lightheaded after that race, and shortness of breath and chest pain was definitely active ... But after a while, I was able to catch my breath and get my wits about me. So I'm feeling a lot better now.\"\n\nThe USA Track & Field organization issued a statement in response, confirming Lyles diagnosis from earlier this week. \"In response, the USOPC [U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee] and USATF swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\"\n\nIt continues: \"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete ...

That would emulate illustrious compatriots Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis, who achieved the feat at a single Games but with long jump instead of the longer relay.\n\n\"It feels good to be out here,\" Lyles told reporters. \"It was in my head win the 120, win the 150, check around, win the heat.\"\n\nAsked what life had been like since his photo-finish victory, he said: \"I've been trying to get some sleep with my phone going off constantly. Right now I've got to rush over and get my medal.\"\n\nFollowing him home in 20.30 was defending champion Andre de Grasse of Canada, the last man to beat him.\n\nAmerican Kenny Bednarek, silver medallist ahead of Lyles in Tokyo and runner-up to him at the 2022 worlds, shut down early but still clocked the fastest time with 19.96.\n\nHe too went well in Sunday\u00b4s 100m final, though his 9.88 was good enough only for seventh.\n\n\"I\u00b4m on a mission for this 200,\" he said. \"What happened yesterday happened. I\u00b4m taking it day by day.\"\n\nErriyon Knighton, world championship silver and bronze medallist as a teenager, made sure there would be three Americans in the semi-finals by winning his heat in 19.99, the only other sub-20 time on a warm Paris evening.\n\nNow 20, Knighton will seek to deliver on the biggest stage after seemingly being the next big thing for years but never quite reaching the top step.\n\nBotswana's Letsile Tebogo, sixth in Sunday\u00b4s 100m final in a national record 9.86 and a bronze medallist over 200m in last year\u00b4s world championships, cruised his heat in 20.10.\n\nWayde van Niekerk, the 400m world record holder and former world championship silver medallist over 200m, made it as the third automatic qualifier from the first heat in 20.42 having opted the skip the one-lap event in Paris.\n\n\"The decision (to run only the 200) was purely based on getting back to a space of enjoying the sport,\" said the South African. \"Finding peace in a sport that has helped me so much.\n\n\"If I look at my performance so far, I'm obviously well off the top tier guys. I\u00b4m going to have to pull a rabbit out of the hat to get among the top three.\" (Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_400_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letsile_Tebogo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letsile Tebogo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erriyon_Knighton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erriyon Knighton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayde_van_Niekerk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayde van Niekerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 26, "textEnd": 31}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

The mildest form of COVID I'm familiar with that isn't symptom-free is congestion that causes a loss of taste. Trying to sprint as fast as you possibly can with any form of that \"milder\" COVID and asthma? Fuhgeddaboudit.\n\nFor a little added context, Lyles publicly posted about his asthma and other adversity earlier on in the Summer Olympics.\n\nMany were giving Lyles grief for his assertion that NBA players aren't technically \"world champions\" when the win the title. Those critiques quieted down when he won 100m gold. Now people are calling him selfish for running despite the potential he had to spread COVID. Not to give the flu and COVID a misguided one-to-one comparison, but I don't recall a lot of folks blasting Michael Jordan back in the day for his \"Flu Game,\" which is a huge staple in his legacy/GOAT case.\n\nThere's also plenty of \"he only announced it now because he didn't win, AKA... an excuse\" commentary out there, with some calling the wheelchair exit reminiscent of Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce in 2008.\n\nAnyway, Friday is the final for the men's 4\u00d7100 relay, and I'd be surprised if Lyles was still able to run in that.

his semi-final behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nTebogo, also a finalist in the 100m, struck a psychological blow to Lyles, crossing the line in 19.96sec, while Lyles timed 20.08sec.\n\nAmerica's Kenny Bednaraek, the second-fastest in the world this year over the distance, clocked 20.00sec to edge out Alexander Ogando of the Dominican Republic in the first semi-final.\n\nErriyon Knighton of the US, a silver and bronze medallist over 200m at the past two world championships, qualified first from the third semi-final, clocking 20.09, ahead of Liberia's Joseph Fahnbulleh.\n\nThe two next-fastest qualifiers were Zimbabwe's Makanakaishe Charamba and compatriot Tapiwanashe Makarawu, meaning defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse does not qualify.\n\nThe two next-fastest qualifiers were Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu and his compatriot Makanakaishe Charamba, meaning defending Olympic champion Andre De Grasse does not qualify after a season in which the Canadian has struggled for form.\n\nTreble-chasing Lyles has the chance to be the standout star of the athletics programme in Paris.\n\nJamaican sprint star Shericka Jackson withdrew from the women's 100m and then pulled out of her 200m heat.\n\nSt Lucia's Julien Alfred, pursuing the women's sprint double, came second behind Gabby Thomas in the 200m after winning the shorter sprint.\n\nLyles, the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallist, has been dominant in his preferred 200m, winning the past three world titles.\n\nHe is the third-fastest half-lap runner in history, with his mark of 19.31sec set at the world championships in Oregon in 2022 ranking behind only Jamaica's Yohan Blake and Bolt's world record of 19.19sec.\n\nRetired Jamaican sprint superstar Bolt did the 100m-200m sprint double at three consecutive Games -- Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016, adding the 4x100m gold in London and Rio.\n\nThe first round of the sprint relay is on Thursday morning but Lyles is likely to be rested following his 200m semi-final.\n\nThe 200m final takes place at 1830 GMT on Thursday.\n\njw/gj\n\nMore from this section\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts Citywide

I just lost a bit of concentration between six and seven. It's a bit frustrating I guess, but I'm happy with how I set the race up, I attacked it and I'm honestly not that upset or disappointed.\n\nNorway's defending Olympic champion Karsten Warholm, who set a world and Olympic record 45.94 seconds at Tokyo 2020, was the fastest of the semi-finalists in 47.67.\n\nGreat Britain's Tade Ojora lined up in heat two of the men's 110 metres semi-finals but did not advance after finishing seventh.\n\nHe said: \"It was a great experience. Obviously I hoped to do better and expected to do better, I wish I'd done better, I let myself down but that's the emotions. I'm sure in a couple of days, maybe a couple of hours I'll be able to look back on that Olympic experience. I've come here and I've accomplished a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Numerous athletes fought to write their names, nations, and in some cases continents, into the history books as elsewhere controversies continued to gather steam.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Day Thirteen at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nFollowing American Cole Hocker taking a surprise gold in the men's 1500 metre on Tuesday, Day 13 saw another shock win as Botswana's Letsile Tebogo became the new 200m champion beating pre-race favourite Noah Lyles.\n\nMuch of the focus had been on 27-year-old Noah Lyles, who on Sunday became the first American to win an Olympic 100m title since Justin Gatlin in 2004 when he beat Jamaica's Kishane Thompson to gold by five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles was bidding to become the first man since Usain Bolt to complete the Olympic 100m and 200m sprint double but lost out to Botswana's 21-year-old Letsile Tebogo.\n\nTebogo stopped Lyles' attempt to make history, instead writing his own name in the history books by winning in 19.46 seconds to become the first African to win the Olympic 200m. He dedicated the win to his mother who died earlier this year.\n\nCovid-19 lingers in the periphery\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympic Games has been dogged by health concerns both before and during its run. Firstly poor air quality in Paris was highlighted when experts publicly scrutinised pollution levels and then once it had all kicked off, there were numerous cancellations and setbacks due to the poor water quality in the River Seine, where some events were scheduled to take place.\n\nMore recently Covid-19 has reminded us that it is still very much around affecting even the best athletes in the world. On Tuesday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) released a statement emphasising a new global rise in cases expressing that over 40 athletes competing at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games had tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nToday Covid-19's rise was accentuated further as Noah Lyles said he'd tested positive before his 200m race and was seen being spoken to by medical staff before being taken off the track in a wheelchair.\n\n\"It definitely affected my performance,\" said Lyles. \"I still wanted to run. They said it was possible.\"\n\nThe water quality in the River Seine has posed a persistent problem for Paris 2024 organisers with numerous training sessions and events delayed or cancelled since the summer games began. Today, however, the women's 10km marathon swim was cleared and took place this morning.\n\nAfter two hours of rigorous swimming Sharon van Rouwendaal of the Netherlands took gold winning her second Olympic title after winning at Rio 2016.\n\nVan Rouwendaal had her own dedication to make after the race, only this time it was to her pet dog Rio, who died in May.\n\n\"My world stopped and I didn't care about swimming for like three weeks,\" said the 30-year-old. \"He was my little baby. I swam for him with my whole heart. I won it for him.\"\n\nA controversy involving two boxers who previously failed gender tests has dogged the summer games but it reached a boiling point in the last week with various parties trading blows.\n\nBoxers Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu Ting of Taiwan were disqualified from the Women's World Championships last year for failing gender eligibility tests but have both made it to the final in their respective categories at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC), who released a statement last week warning against the amassing outcry turning into a \"witch-hunt\", have come under fire from the International Boxing Association (IBA) which carried out the eligibility tests last year.\n\nOutcry gathered steam when the two boxers began competing, especially when Imane Khelif forced a 46-second withdrawal from Italy's Angela Carini who claimed she had never been hit so hard in her life.\n\nNow there is another chapter in the gender controversy which has become synonymous with the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nAfter Bulgaria's Svetlana Staneva was eliminated by Lin Yu-Ting in the women's -57kg category she held up crossed fingers in the form of an X to allude to the single X chromosome that men have. When Esra Yildiz of Turkey lost to Imane Khelif in the 66kg semi-final she did the same thing.\n\nNow with the IBA threatening to release information about the confidential eligibility tests that it carried out the Olympic Committees of Algeria and Chinese Taipei have threatened legal action against the IBA.\n\nThe controversy will no doubt continue indefinitely with both boxers set to play in their respective finals on Saturday.\n\nAs Day Thirteen at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games draws to a close the United States of America has consolidated its position at the top of the table staying ahead of the People's Republic of China by one gold medal.\n\nTeam USA also has the highest number of medals overall with 103, 30 of them gold, while the People's Republic of China has 29 golds and 73 medals overall.\n\nAustralia make up the top three with 18 golds considerably less than the top two while France follows Australia with 14 golds.\n\nGreat Britain, the Republic of Korea, and Japan sit in fifth, sixth, and seventh respectively having all won 13 golds though Great Britain's total medal count of 51 some way more than the other two.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType":

We've already seen most of the athletes who are identifiable by one name: Biles, Ledecky, Lyles, Marchand. There's still some suspense over basketball and soccer and the remaining track finals, including Thursday's men's 200 meters, but this is a good time to zoom out and take stock.\n\nSo that's just what we're going to do.\n\nHere are the biggest winners of the Olympics so far:\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nHere's a smattering of things Lyles said publicly in the past year:\n\n\"I watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head. World champion of what? The United States? ... We [track and field] are the world. ... There ain't no flags in the NBA.\"\n\n\"I'm a true believer that the moment isn't bigger than me. The moment was made for me.\"\n\n\"Everybody has their own vibe. I'm a showman.\"\n\nAnd, after failing to win his 100-meter heat in Paris, Lyles told NBC: \"I think I'm more excited now that I didn't win that heat. I'm pretty scared for everybody else right now.\"\n\nAll this to say, the difference between Lyles becoming an American Olympic legend and one of its all-time laughingstocks came down to five-thousandths of a second.\n\nThat's the margin by which Lyles ultimately won the 100-meter final in what was irrefutably the best moment of the Olympic Games -- a photo finish in its biggest single event. Lyles still has to run the 200-meter final on Thursday, but that's the event in which he's a massive favorite and it's slightly lower-profile than the 100.\n\nIt's been a long time since the U.S. had a 100-meter winner -- 20 years on the men's side, and that was Justin Gatlin, whose later PED suspension made his win in Athens hard to celebrate. If Lyles wins the 200, as he's expected to do, he'll be the first American man to complete the double since Carl Lewis in 1984.\n\nLyles not only could put himself in that company, but he's established himself as a brand name who can back up everything that comes out of his mouth.\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand\n\nIt's rare that a non-American athlete becomes must-watch television at the Olympics. The list, over the past 20 or so years, pretty much started and ended with Usain Bolt, at least until Marchand entered the scene.\n\nThe native of Toulouse, who swam at Arizona State in college, won gold in all four of his individual events in front of a delirious home crowd. Even on TV, the scene was astonishing -- the crowd timing its chants to Marchand's head bobbing out of the water on the breaststroke was something that will stay with people from these Games.\n\nMarchand going for two golds in a day in the 200-meter butterfly and 200-meter breaststroke -- chasing down Hungary's Krist\u00f3f Mil\u00e1k in the final 50 meters to seal the butterfly -- produced some of the best drama and best TV of the Games as Michael Phelps cheered him on.\n\n(On a related note, U.S. men's swimming was one of the major losers of the Games, with Phelps saying he was \"pretty disappointed\" at the results, which included just one individual gold.)\n\nEven as the United States produced some moments on the women's side and in the swim relays, finishing with the most gold medals at the meet after trailing for nearly the entire duration, it was Marchand who provided the best entertainment.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nSpeaking of Phelps, the greatest swimmer of all time feels like an apt comparison for Biles, the greatest gymnast of all time.\n\nBiles has carried the baton for the American Olympic team since 2016 in the same way Phelps did in Beijing and London. Even in her third Olympic Games, even after Tokyo went off the rails for her three years ago, every event in which Biles competed felt must-watch. And the redemptive arc that could have been pre-written by ChatGPT came true with Biles taking three golds and a silver medal.\n\nBiles even turned the silver -- which was a disappointment in the floor event, where she was supposed to win a fourth gold -- into a triumph as she and Jordan Chiles bowed down to Brazil's Rebecca Andrade in the sort of display of sportsmanship that fulfills every Olympic clich\u00e9.\n\nThe IOC has made a habit out of holding the Olympics in far-off countries, a couple of which have authoritarian governments, for the past decade.\n\nSince London 2012, the Games have gone to Sochi, Rio de Janeiro, Pyeongchang, Tokyo and Beijing. If you want to know why the Olympics haven't drawn quite as much of an American audience, start there. (Quick -- what's a tourist attraction in Pyeongchang? Do you know anyone who's visited? Now answer the same questions about Paris.)\n\nIt's difficult to follow the Olympics in a time zone that's 10-12 hours different from the East Coast. It doesn't feel good to read story after story about the Zika virus or athletes being stuck in China if they test positive for COVID. The pandemic -- and subsequent lack of crowds -- didn't help either.\n\nParis' time zone works perfectly for a U.S. audience, letting people wake up and watch the Olympics all day. In an era where streaming and social media make tape delay a hard proposition, a European time zone makes it so NBC can cover the Olympics both as a live event and in prime time with tape delay, giving it the best of both.\n\nHaving recognizable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower be a part of the Games makes it feel bigger and a little more relatable. So does having American celebrities such as Snoop Dogg and Flavor Flav be characters around the Games, which, let's face it, is directly correlated to the Olympics being in Paris as opposed to a less appealing destination.\n\nParis hasn't been perfect -- using the Seine for the triathlon, for example, looks like a failed gamble, and residents of the city have rightful complaints about the security level that came with integrating so many temporary venues with tourist attractions. But compared to the hosts we've gotten for the last decade, it's lapping the field.\n\nNBC\n\nEverything in the above blurb, of course, serves to help NBC, which has seen its best Olympics ratings in a pretty long time, in part as a result of the Games being in Paris.\n\nBut NBC has also done the right thing with these Olympics, and deserves credit there.\n\nMike Tirico has come into his own as a studio host, and the addition of Phelps to the coverage was just as much of a home run as it looked on paper.\n\nGold Zone has been fantastic day-in and day-out -- and gave people who weren't diehard fans of the Premier League or \"The Office\" a reason to subscribe to Peacock.\n\nBeing less committed to tape delay, while keeping the prime time show that gives casual fans a way into the Olympics, was unequivocally the right call.\n\nIf we have one nitpick, it's that it should be easier to go online and see what each day's schedule is, what's live at a given moment and what the scores are at every live event. That's always been a problem with the Olympics because there's so much going on that it's hard to lay it all out in one place. But as the rights holder, it's something NBC take the lead on tackling for 2026.\n\nKristen Faulkner\n\nInevitably, there are 50 different stories from the Olympics that deserve more coverage than they get. Faulkner's, though, might lead the field.\n\nA 31-year-old who grew up in Homer, Alaska, Faulkner picked up cycling as a hobby after moving to New York in 2017. She eventually quit her job as a venture capitalist, turned pro and -- after getting hit by a car and breaking her shin bone last year -- made the Olympics.\n\nAlready having qualified for the cycling team pursuit, she got a spot in the women's road race after Taylor Knibb resigned to focus on the time trial and triathlon.\n\nThen Faulkner went and won gold in the road race by nearly a full minute, becoming the first American woman to do so since 1984.\n\nOn Wednesday, she helped the U.S. to gold in the team pursuit, joining a very short list of athletes ever to win gold in what's technically two different sports (\"road cycling\" and \"track cycling\") at one Olympics.\n\nIt's the sort of story that should be turned into a movie, the kind that would be laughed out of a room as unbelievable and clich\u00e9 if you pitched it. There might not be a better one that's played out in Paris.\n\nDoes a fiery pair of joint practices translate to actual juice for the preseason opener between the Giants and Lions on Thursday (7 p.m. ET, Fox)?\n\nErrr, probably not.\n\nHistory tells us \"juice\" and \"preseason\" are two words that almost never should be used in a sentence together. It's also worth noting that the practice fights generally involved players whose spots on their respective depth charts are sealed -- in other words, not the guys who will be on the field in, say, the third quarter of a preseason game.\n\nThe preseason opener is a good milestone to reach. It means real football is close.\n\nBut the general rule is the same as training camp: It's exciting until the moment it actually starts. Then you start getting antsy for the regular season.\n\nThe news from Port St. Lucie appeared to be all positive for Starling Marte on Wednesday. He didn't play the field, but hit three times as a DH, going 1-for-3 and adding a stolen base.\n\nThe Mets lately appear to have found some equilibrium between their awful start to the season and their Grimace-fueled resurgence, but they'll need to trend more toward the latter to make the playoffs, let alone to do something once there.\n\nParticularly in the midst of a long road trip that has produced an underwhelming 3-3 record after Wednesday's nail-biting 5-3 win over the Rockies, the possibility of getting Marte back soon should be enticing for this lineup.\n\nThough Marte struggled in 2023, he was in the midst of a bounce-back campaign with a 113 OPS+ before getting hurt.\n\nAfter a trade deadline when Jesse Winker was the only lineup addition, Marte would fulfill the prototypical saying that the best deadline acquisition is the player returning from injury.\n\nZach Messinger continued to roll on the mound. The Yankees right-hander tossed seven scoreless frames on Wednesday, striking out four for Double-A Somerset.\n\nMessinger, who also threw seven innings in his last start, has not gone fewer than five frames since June 21. His ERA now sits at 3.40, the lowest it's been since his first start of the year.\n\n-- Andrew Battifarano\n\n\u26be \"The Yankees look like the Yankees again,\" declares The Post's Mike Vaccaro, after a soggy doubleheader split in The Bronx that left them atop the American League standings. Two things to watch: The Yankees pushed back Marcus Stroman \"to work through some things,\" and what about a Juan Soto-Aaron Judge lineup flip?\n\n\ud83c\udfc8 Xavier Gipson isn't a Jets roster long shot anymore. In Year 2, he's trying to establish himself as a starting-caliber slot receiver.\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Kevin Durant, whom Jim Boeheim calls the best international player ever, and Team USA face Nikola Jokic's Serbia in Thursday's Olympics semifinals (3 p.m. ET, USA Network).\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 The Las Vegas Aces, um, Team USA women reached the semis, too.\n\n\u26be Little League drama!

Rasco/Sports Illustrated\n\nNoah Lyles, a favorite to win gold at the 200-meter final at the Paris Games, came in third, securing bronze. His place on the podium was a shock, until shortly after the race he was seen being tended to by medical staff and taken off in a wheelchair. The first thought was that he may have run through an injury, but the reality was he ran while ill from COVID.\n\nLyles tested positive a few days ago and described attempting to quarantine to the best of his ability leading up to the 200-meter. He did not break any Olympic protocols by participating in the event. Teams and individuals are able to participate at their discretion even if COVID positive in 2024 after restrictions for the past two Games.\n\nThe main reason Lyles opted to race, despite the illness, was resilience. He spoke after the race about how he was proud of being able to come out to participate despite the circumstances.\n\n\"My first thought [after testing positive] was not to panic, thinking I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in worse situations, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run with worse conditions, and we just took it day by day, trying to hydrate, quarantined off. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken its toll for sure, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and get a bronze medal.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nHis medal, the same one he achieved last Olympics, feels much different this time around:\n\n\"It's taken its toll for sure, but I've never been more proud of myself for being able to come out here and getting a bronze medal where last Olympic I was very disappointed, and this time I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nAsked if he ever considered not running, he said: \"No. No, I didn't. I just said we was just going to quarantine as much as possible, stay away, not trying to, you know, pass it off and, just to be honest, give it my all.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1276,h_717,x_524,y_324/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si/01j4sqwh5tjsr0bzgqf4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

Last year, however, that put him at odds with some of the most high-profile basketball players in the NBA.\n\nAt last year's world championships, Lyles won the 100-meter and 200-meter races - a double he's trying to repeat in the Olympics on Thursday night after winning the 100m on Sunday - and wasn't shy about comparing his accomplishments to those of his professional basketball counterparts back in the US.\n\nWhen speaking to reporters at the World Championships in Budapest, Lyles was asked about what he wanted to do for track and field and what he'd like to see to improve the sport's profile.\n\nLyles said the medals he wins are the first step to raising track's awareness in the public's eye and that he wants more former world champions to be present at high-profile meets. And then he took a turn into taking a shot at the NBA.\n\n\"You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on they head. World champion of what? The United States? Don't get me wrong, I love the US - at times - but that ain't the world,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA.\"\n\nLyles' comment hit on something that sports fans in the rest of the world often mock about US sports culture. In almost every major American sport, the champion of the league is referred to as the world champion, even though those teams only play against other franchises that are based in either the US or Canada.\n\nBut the US' distinct sporting culture means that the four major American sports - football, basketball, baseball and hockey - are head and shoulders above those sports' domestic leagues in other nations. Most of the best players from around the world in those sports end up playing for American teams, hence the claim to the title of world champion: case and point, the last six NBA MVP awards went to players who were born abroad.\n\nLyles' comment was not welcomed by the American NBA players who he had called out.\n\nTwo-time NBA champion and 2014 MVP Kevin Durant, who has also been named Finals MVP twice in his illustrious career, led the charge.\n\n\"Somebody help this brother,\" he wrote on Instagram, responding to an ESPN post.\n\nFour-time NBA champion Draymond Green also got involved, writing on Instagram, \"When being smart goes wrong\" with the face-palm emoji. Devin Booker, who plays on Team USA in these Olympics and the Phoenix Suns, just simply posted a facepalm emoji.\n\nSo if Lyles ends up winning the 100m-200m double, don't expect very many American NBA players to be celebrating publicly.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But he's not the only one.\n\nLyles' diagnosis two days ago was first reported by NBC on Thursday and confirmed by the athlete after he failed to complete a sought-after sprint double in the 200-meter final, where he finished third.\n\nThe 27-year-old won the 100-meter race on Sunday, but was never appeared to be a serious contender for victory in Thursday's race, eventually surging to earn a bronze medal before struggling to leave the track and ultimately leaving the stadium floor in a wheelchair.\n\n\"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight,\" according a statement from USA Track & Field. \"We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely. As an organization, we are rigorously adhering to CDC, USOPC, and IOC guidelines for respiratory illnesses to prevent the spread of illness among team members, safeguarding their health and performance.\"\n\nIn contrast to the Tokyo Games that were delayed to summer of 2021 by the global pandemic and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing whose footprint included frequent testing, widespread mask wearing and social distancing, the Paris Games have stadiums full of fans and zero lingering protocols. Athletes and teams, rather than medical personnel, are given the responsibility to gauge their health and respond to issues.\n\nLyles said he boosted hydration to treat himself and voluntarily quarantined \"to not pass it off\" to teammates. Games-wide, athletes who are not feeling well are not required to wear masks or wash hands but are encouraged to avoid close contact and utilize single rooms in the Olympic Village and separate transportation to and from events.\n\nHe is an asthma sufferer and was seen wearing a mask for two days since his Tuesday diagnosis but said after the race that he'd \"never considered\" not running the 200. He is, however, leaning toward not running his leg in the 4x100-meter relay final on Friday.\n\nScientific American reported Wednesday that \"at least 19\" athletes in Paris had tested positive for COVID, many of them competing in aquatic sports -- including Australian swimmers Lani Pallister and Zac Stubblety-Cook and Great Britain's Adam Peaty.\n\nSome athletes have dropped out of events but Manuel Ertel, a German decathlete, is the only one who's left the Games. A 2024 study of German athletes indicated elite athletes typically had milder infections than non-elite counterparts, but still had symptoms that lingered for several weeks.\n\nA World Health Organization representative said Tuesday that COVID rates have increased worldwide in the last few weeks and that more than 20 percent of COVID tests in recent weeks have been positive.\n\nLyles said he woke up Tuesday at 5 a.m. not feeling well and immediately summoned doctors and was tested, but his \"first thought was not to panic,\" he said. \"I've run with worse conditions, I felt.\"",

Zambia's Muzala Samukonga took bronze in 43.74sec.\n\nIt was the first time ever five athletes had gone below 44 seconds in the same race.\n\nHall became the first American man to win the one-lap event at the Olympics since LaShawn Merritt in Beijing in 2008.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" said Hall, who was only a bronze medallist at last year's world championships. \"I've been putting a lot of work in. This is my second year running the 400.\n\n\"Last year I told you guys I was going to get a better medal this year. Guess what? I got one gold.\"\n\nThe fourth gold of the night went to Australia as Kennedy cleared a best of 4.90m.\n\nAmerican Katie Moon, the defending champion with whom Kennedy had shared world gold in Budapest last year, claimed silver on countback from Canada's Alysha Newman after they both managed 4.85m.\n\nLyles on track\n\nA trio of track stars safely negotiated their way into their respective event finals.\n\nNoah Lyles qualified for the 200m final on Wednesday to stay on track for the first Olympic men's sprint treble since Usain Bolt achieved the feat at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nThe American three-time world champion, who won the 100m by five thousandths of a second from Jamaican Kishane Thompson in 9.79sec, finished second in his semi-final behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nTebogo, also a finalist in the 100m, struck a psychological blow to Lyles, crossing the line in 19.96sec, while Lyles timed 20.08sec.\n\nDefending champion Karsten Warholm wrapped up his semi-final to progress to Saturday's final of the 400m hurdles.\n\nWarholm, who set a sensational world record in winning gold at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games three years ago, will be joined by arch-rivals Rai Benjamin and Alison Dos Santos, although the latter had to qualify as a fastest loser.\n\nAnd finally three-time world champion Grant Holloway's quest for an elusive Olympic 110m hurdles gold remained on track.\n\nThe 26-year-old American streaked home in an impressive 12.98sec, finishing far ahead of the rest of the field after a dynamite start.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr",

(AFP)\n\nMorocco's steeplechase king Soufiane El Bakkali on Wednesday became just the third Arab to win double Olympic gold while Jamaica's Roje Stona upset the favourites to claim a memorable men's discus title.\n\nIn a thrilling 400m final, American Quincy Hall overtook Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith in the final metre to win the 400m and become the fourth-fastest one-lap performer in history.\n\nA capacity 69,000 crowd at the Stade de France also saw Nina Kennedy bag a first-ever women's pole vault gold for Australia.\n\nThree-time world champion El Bakkali timed 8min 06.05sec for victory in the 3000m steeplechase ahead of American Kenneth Rooks and Kenya's Abraham Kibiwot.\n\nHis second Olympic gold, having first win in the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games, leaves him in a small group of Arab athletes to have doubled up at the Summer Games.\n\nOnly his Moroccan compatriot Hicham El Guerrouj, who won 1500m and 5,000m gold in Athens 2004, and Tunisian swimmer Oussama Mellouli (1500m freestyle in Beijing 2008 and 10km marathon in London 2012) have achieved the feat.\n\nThe discus produced a feast of high-level throwing, Stona coming out on top to upset world record holder Mykolas Alekna.\n\nLithuanian Alekna had broken the Olympic record with his best mark of 69.97m on his second effort.\n\nBut plans to emulate his father Virgilijus, who won two Olympic titles in 2000 and 2004, were scotched by the Jamaican.\n\nStona, coached by American Ryan Crouser who won an unprecedented third consecutive shot put gold on Saturday, stole the show when he threw out to an Olympic record of 70.00m on his fourth attempt.\n\nOn the track, Hall produced a perfectly-timed finish and savage dip for victory in the 400m in 43.40sec. The 26-year-old pipped a desperately disappointed Hudson-Smith, who improved his own European record to 43.44sec.\n\nZambia's Muzala Samukonga took bronze in 43.74sec.\n\nIt was the first time ever five athletes had gone below 44 seconds in the same race. Hall became the first American man to win the one-lap event at the Olympics since LaShawn Merritt in Beijing in 2008.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" said Hall, who was only a bronze medallist at last year's world championships.\n\n\"I've been putting a lot of work in. This is my second year running the 400. \"Last year I told you guys I was going to get a better medal this year. Guess what? I got one gold.\"\n\nThe fourth gold of the night went to Australia as Kennedy cleared a best of 4.90m.\n\nAmerican Katie Moon, the defending champion with whom Kennedy had shared world gold in Budapest last year, claimed silver on countback from Canada's Alysha Newman after they both managed 4.85m.\n\nLyles on track A trio of track stars safely negotiated their way into their respective event finals. Noah Lyles qualified for the 200m final on Wednesday to stay on track for the first Olympic men's sprint treble since Usain Bolt achieved the feat at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nThe American three-time world champion, who won the 100m by five thousandths of a second from Jamaican Kishane Thompson in 9.79sec, finished second in his semi-final behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nTebogo, also a finalist in the 100m, struck a psychological blow to Lyles, crossing the line in 19.96sec, while Lyles timed 20.08sec.\n\nAnd finally three-time world champion Grant Holloway's quest for an elusive Olympic 110m hurdles gold remained on track.\n\nThe 26-year-old American streaked home in an impressive 12.98sec, finishing far ahead of the rest of the field after a dynamite start.", "source":

The win cements him as one of the greatest sprinters of all-time. His gold medal comes with a $50,000 prize, and he had reportedly signed the richest endorsement deal for any runner since Usain Bolt.\n\nThis win, however, should also catapult him into one of sports' most marketable athletes, and lead to even bigger paydays. One way to get there: A signature sneaker, which he has now told Adidas he wants.\n\nLyles returns to the track tomorrow for Round 1 of the 200-meter race, and he has a chance to become the first Olympian since Usain Bolt in 2016 to win both the 100-meter and 200-meter events, known as the \"double.\" He achieved his first \"double\" at the 2023 World Athletics Championships.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23910511-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 91, "relevance": 1}

It was first reported by Lewis Johnson of NBC.\n\nLyles was seen wearing a mask before participating in the final. After the final when he secured bronze, he received medical attention and left the track in a wheelchair. Lyles has been outspoken about his asthma previously.\n\nWhat are the COVID Protocols at Paris Games?\n\nShort answer: There are no formal or event-level requirements. How to handle the threat of the disease is decided by teams and individuals.\n\nUnlike the two other games (Toyko 2020, Beijing 2022) that had extensive athlete testing and protocols for positive tests, the regulations and requirements around testing are much more relaxed.\n\nAthletes do not have to be subjected to mandatory regular testing and reporting. Furthermore, positive tests do not stipulate sitting out from events. Participation for positive athletes is at the discretion of the athlete, teams, and medical staff.\n\nHere is some insight from Scientific American:\n\n\"The Paris Games also drop all previous COVID protocols, instead approaching the disease like other respiratory illnesses such as the common cold or the flu: officials now allow athletes and teams to determine for themselves how to prevent or respond to infection.\"\n\nAccording to SciAm, at least a handful of swimmers have already competed in events while having tested positive for COVID.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as What Are COVID Protocols at the Olympics in Paris?.", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_wilson@sunherald.com", "name": "Josh Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Software", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/2hokmo/picture290888639/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/d8de7dd2-81f0-4e4c-afe5-dc83f82de629", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 91, "relevance": 1}

Zambia's Muzala Samukonga took bronze in 43.74sec.\n\nIt was the first time ever five athletes had gone below 44 seconds in the same race.\n\nHall became the first American man to win the one-lap event at the Olympics since LaShawn Merritt in Beijing in 2008.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" said Hall, who was only a bronze medallist at last year's world championships. \"I've been putting a lot of work in. This is my second year running the 400.\n\n\"Last year I told you guys I was going to get a better medal this year. Guess what? I got one gold.\"\n\nThe fourth gold of the night went to Australia as Kennedy cleared a best of 4.90m.\n\nAmerican Katie Moon, the defending champion with whom Kennedy had shared world gold in Budapest last year, claimed silver on countback from Canada's Alysha Newman after they both managed 4.85m.\n\nLyles on track\n\nA trio of track stars safely negotiated their way into their respective event finals.\n\nNoah Lyles qualified for the 200m final on Wednesday to stay on track for the first Olympic men's sprint treble since Usain Bolt achieved the feat at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nThe American three-time world champion, who won the 100m by five thousandths of a second from Jamaican Kishane Thompson in 9.79sec, finished second in his semi-final behind Botswana's Letsile Tebogo.\n\nTebogo, also a finalist in the 100m, struck a psychological blow to Lyles, crossing the line in 19.96sec, while Lyles timed 20.08sec.\n\nDefending champion Karsten Warholm wrapped up his semi-final to progress to Saturday's final of the 400m hurdles.\n\nWarholm, who set a sensational world record in winning gold at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games three years ago, will be joined by arch-rivals Rai Benjamin and Alison Dos Santos, although the latter had to qualify as a fastest loser.\n\nAnd finally three-time world champion Grant Holloway's quest for an elusive Olympic 110m hurdles gold remained on track.\n\nThe 26-year-old American streaked home in an impressive 12.98sec, finishing far ahead of the rest of the field after a dynamite start.", "source": {"uri":

The controversy has led many to question what the health and safety protocols are at the Olympics amid a summer surge in COVID cases.\n\nAccording to NBC News, at least 40 athletes -- now including Lyles -- have tested positive for COVID during the Summer Olympic Games. COVID spikes during the summer months have been common since the pandemic began in 2020, and strict restrictions were in place for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo (held in 2021) and the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.\n\nNot anymore. The 2024 Summer Games has had no mandatory, preventive measures in place to slow infection rates. Masking and testing have not been required, but an International Olympics Committee spokesperson told NBC that the organization is \"following good practices in managing infectious diseases\" at Paris 2024.\n\nThe United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee implemented its own preventive program under the slogan \"don't let a cold keep you from the gold.\" It encouraged athletes like Lyles -- who was visibly exhausted and laid down to the track following the 200m sprint -- to wash their hands frequently and to wear masks during long travel periods.\n\nEven though officials were confident that the 2024 Summer Olympics would not be a \"superspreader event,\" dozens have cases have now been confirmed and an athlete was permitted to race in spite of a positive COVID test. Only time will tell as to whether the IOC reconsiders its stance or finds a way to minimize the present damage.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspreading_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superspreading event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/4c67801a49c55fb63a52272e9fcc6201/crop/0x0/1978x1318/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/08/08/17231465014565.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792855", "eventUri": "eng-9792855", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 86, "relevance": 1}

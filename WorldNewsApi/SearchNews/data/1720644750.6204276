And whether or not you\u2019re a gin drinker, one of those bottles is Bombay Sapphire. The slender, rectangular vessel with gem-like facets and a distinct translucent blue hue can be spotted from a mile away. It all started in 1761 when Thomas Dakin purchased a site in England with the intent of distilling gin, but the family didn\u2019t purchase a still until seven decades later. Fast forward to 1987 and Bombay Sapphire was born, a London dry gin that would eventually become a staple at every bar. But there\u2019s more to Bombay Sapphire than being a go-to for gin martini drinkers. Here, a closer look at the iconic brand in honor of World Gin Day. The Name Was Inspired By A Real Sapphire One might have just assumed that Bombay Sapphire wanted a recognizable blue bottle and named the brand accordingly, but it was actually inspired by a real sapphire. The Star of Bombay is a 182-carat, cabochon-cut star sapphire from Sri Lanka that once belonged to actress Mary Pickford (she was also one of the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, aka the organization behind the Oscars). The Star of Bombay has not only been greatly admired for its remarkable size, but most notably its distinct star rays. Pickford eventually gifted the gem to the Smithsonian and is currently on display at the institute\u2019s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Bombay Sapphire's master distiller Dr. Anne Brock with the infusion tray Photo: Courtesy of Bombay Sapphire A Unique Vapor Infusion Method Is Used To Extract Flavors Gin is typically created by either steeping or boiling botanicals directly in a base spirit, but Bombay Sapphire approaches this flavor-defining step of the distillation process differently. Instead, they use what is called a vapor infusion method. A tray of perforated copper baskets are hand-layered with up to 12 botanicals, depending on the Bombay expression, and loaded into the stills. Hovering above the alcohol, the still is run slowly to allow the vapors to fully permeate through the baskets, gently extracting the essential oils from all of the botanicals, before passing through condensers to return to a liquid state. This in turn \u201cunlocks the best of the harvest,\u201d says master distiller Dr. Anne Brock, \u201cguaranteeing that only the brightest, natural, and vibrant tastes are captured, resulting in a uniquely balanced, bright, and fresh flavor where each botanical complements one another, making the gin inherently mixable and versatile.\u201d Which, if you think about it, makes sense. Because instead of essentially cooking the botanicals like a steep-and-boil gin would, thereby potentially drawing out altered flavors as a result of direct heat, this process highlights the botanicals\u2019 notes in a purer form.

Now, it serves as Bombay Sapphire\u2019s state-of-the-art distillery and is open to visitors on the weekends. In addition to tours of the grounds\u2014where you\u2019ll get to learn about Bombay Sapphire\u2019s history and process\u2014there are also a myriad of cocktail masterclasses for a more interactive experience. And, of course, a gift shop where you\u2019ll find the brand\u2019s entire range of gins, including limited-edition bottles. Some Gins Are Only Sold In The United Kingdom When you\u2019re visiting the UK, or, better yet, perusing the shop at the distillery, keep an eye out for the bottles that are exclusive to the island nation. For those who enjoy a classic Tom Collins, consider the lemon-flavored Bombay Citron Press\u00e9. If you prefer warming spices and mandarin oranges, then Bombay Sapphire Sunset may be more your speed. As for some local flavors (pennyroyal, mint, rosehip), Bombay Sapphire English Estate uses botanicals sourced from the English countryside. But if you\u2019re a juniper purist, the small-batch Bombay Sapphire Premier Cru Tuscan Juniper really showcases the berries sourced from Italy, which have an herbaceous and floral quality.

But perhaps the best example of the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability can be seen at the distillery. In addition to running on renewable electricity, the facility has implemented a rainwater harvesting system that saves a million liters of water per year and uses thermal-heat recovery to reduce energy use. During the pandemic they found a way to upcycle mash with anaerobic digestion, creating enough energy to power 10 domestic homes for a year. Even the distillery\u2019s pair of glasshouses designed by Heatherwick Studio\u2014which serve as a living showroom for the plants that grow the 10 core botanicals used for Bombay Sapphire gin\u2014are maintained by the waste heat created by the still building it\u2019s connected to.

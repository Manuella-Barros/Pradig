controversial north Belfast parade.\n\nIn a statement, the order also claimed that the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (CARA) had \"weaponised the dialogue process\".\n\nIt comes after it emerged Orange Order members had applied for a contentious parade through a flashpoint area despite doing a deal with nationalist residents.\n\nLocal people voiced concern after it emerged that Ligoniel Loyal Order notified the Parades Commission of its intention to parade past the Ardoyne, Mountainview and Dales area on July 12.\n\nThe planned parade is expected to include one band and up to 90 participants.\n\nViolence has erupted in the past after Twelfth of July parades were blocked from passing through the area resulting in a loyalist protest camp being set up in Twaddell Avenue in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 an agreement saw a voluntary moratorium placed on future return parades, and as a result, the 2017 march took place without protest from Ardoyne residents for the first time in almost two decades.\n\nHowever, earlier this week CARA said that three lodges linked to the 2016 agreement have now broken the pact.\n\nAnother residents group, Greater Ardoyne Residents' Collective (GARC), also warned that if the parade is given the green light by the Parades Commission it will hold a \"counter march\".\n\nBut in a statement to the BBC on Thursday, the Orange Order said the 2016 deal has broken down.\n\nSpencer Beattie, Belfast County Grand Master, said: \"Hundreds of hours of work and dozens of face-to-face discussions have been undermined by Cara, who have weaponised the dialogue process.\n\n\"This cynical and malicious refusal to allow the three local Orange lodges and their Protestant neighbours the right to return home is a flagrant breach of the agreement and a blatant disregard for the most fundamental of human rights.\n\n\"Regrettably, this bad faith dialogue on the part of Cara has meant a collapse of the 2016 parading agreement.\"\n\nHe added the Order is \"resolute\" on a \"right\" to a return march, \"no matter the opposition or threat of violence.\"\n\nThe Parades Commission is due to make a decision by July 3.", "source": {"uri":

this could have major implications for the policing of the 12th of July in north Belfast.\n\nAs well as the violence that this parade witnessed about a decade ago, there was also a \u00a322m policing bill over the years to attempt to keep the situation calm before agreement was put in place.\n\nParading in Northern Ireland has been transformed in the last decade or so.\n\nOf course there are still parades of contention, but this situation has by-in-large been completely diffused.\n\nBut this is going to present a big challenge for The Parades Commission and the enforcement of whatever determination it makes.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardoyne", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ardoyne"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orange Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F\u00e9in", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sinn F\u00e9in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(Northern_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerry Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parades_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parades Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumlin,_County_Antrim", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crumlin, County Antrim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Crumlin, County Antrim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelfth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Twelfth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Pride_Celebrations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Pride Celebrations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/440af49b7e18139a89db324ed3cb299b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667117", "eventUri": "eng-9667117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 233, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 2381, "textEnd": 2387}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

despite breakdown of parade deal, says senior officer", "body": "A senior police commander has said he does not detect an appetite for disorder at a parading flashpoint in Belfast despite the breakdown of a deal between Orangemen and nationalist residents.\n\nPSNI Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton was commenting after the collapse of an agreement struck in 2016 to resolve what at the time was Northern Ireland's most volatile parading dispute, in the Woodvale/Ardoyne area of north Belfast.\n\nThe flashpoint has previously witnessed serious loyalist and republican rioting when tensions linked to a contentious Orange march boiled over on the main date in the parading calendar - the Twelfth of July.\n\nA 24/7 loyalist protest camp was set up at the sectarian interface in 2013 when the Parades Commission - a government-appointed adjudication panel for controversial marches - prevented Orangemen belonging to three Orange lodges passing the nationalist Ardoyne along the Crumlin Road as they returned from traditional Twelfth commemorations.\n\nNightly protests were held in the nearby unionist Woodvale/Twaddell area in the years after that, with a protest parade every Saturday.\n\nThe policing operation at the site has cost in excess of \u00a320 million over three years.\n\nAfter protracted negotiations, an accord between the three lodges and the main nationalist residents group - the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (Cara) - was reached in 2016.\n\nIt saw the Orangemen complete the outstanding leg of their 2013 parade on a morning in September 2016, after which the loyalist camp at the interface was dismantled and all associated protests ended.\n\nFrom that point on, the lodges agreed not to apply for any more return parades on the Twelfth until a wider agreement on the issue was reached.\n\nIn return, Cara agreed not to protest at the lodges' already permitted outward parade on the morning of the Twelfth.\n\nThat deal has now fallen through, with Orangemen having applied to the Parades Commission for permission to parade past Ardoyne on the evening of the Twelfth.\n\nCara has applied to stage a protest in the area at the same time.\n\nThe commission will adjudicate on those applications on July 3.\n\nResponding to the developments, Mr Singleton said: \"Police are aware of heightened tensions following the breakdown in engagement between the respective parties in north Belfast, despite the heightened tensions we don't believe there is an appetite for disorder on any side.\n\n\"We will be prepared and will work with all parties irrespective of any decision made by the Parades Commission to deliver a public safety operation.\"\n\nCounty Grand Master of the Orange Order in Belfast Spencer Beattie accused residents' representatives in Ardoyne of \"bad faith\".\n\nHe said the \"voluntary moratorium\" on a return parade on the evening of the Twelfth was introduced pending a longer-term deal to facilitate such a parade in the future.\n\n\"This cynical and malicious refusal to allow the three local Orange lodges and their Protestant neighbours the right to return home is a flagrant breach of the agreement and a blatant disregard for the most fundamental of human rights,\" Mr Beattie said.\n\nCara expressed concern about the potential impact on community relations in the area.\n\n\"The people of the area have had peace and normality in their lives since 2016 and want that to continue into the future,\" the residents' association said in a statement.\n\nThe group said while it had applied to protest at the proposed evening parade it would not protest at the morning parades.\n\n\"Cross-community relations have been improving over the years and we very much hope that will continue,\" Cara added.\n\nSinn Fein MLA for North Belfast Gerry Kelly said residents had \"enjoyed peace and some semblance of normality in their lives\" due to the 2016 agreement.\n\n\"Sinn Fein will continue to stand with residents in their opposition to this parade which contravenes the 2016 agreement, and we will be raising our serious concerns with the Parades Commission,\" he said.\n\nCatch up with the

silence over north Belfast flashpoint parade plan", "body": "The Orange Order is staying tight lipped after it emerged members in north Belfast have applied to push a contentious parade through a flashpoint area despite doing a deal with nationalist residents.\n\nLocal people voiced concern after it emerged that Ligoniel Loyal Order has notified the Parades Commission of its intention to parade past the Ardoyne, Mountainview and Dales area on July 12.\n\nViolence has erupted in the past after Twelfth of July parades were blocked from passing through the area resulting in a loyalist protest camp being set up in Twaddell Avenue in 2013.\n\nIn 2016 an agreement saw a voluntary moratorium placed on future return parades, and as a result, the 2017 march took place without protest from Ardoyne residents for the first time in almost two decades.\n\nCrumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (CARA) said that three lodges linked to the 2016 agreement had broken the pact.\n\nThe group indicted it would now apply for a protest and will be meeting with the Parades Commission.\n\n\"The people of the area have had peace and normality in their lives since 2016 and want that to continue into the future,\" a statement said.\n\n\"The loyal orders still have five morning parades which we agreed not to protest about.\n\n\"In line with the agreement we will be adhering to our part in that agreement.\n\n\"Cross community relations have been improving over the years and we very much hope that will continue.\"\n\nSDLP councillor Carl Whyte said the previous agreement \"ended years of disorder in this area which nobody wants to see any return to\".\n\n\"Residents have been clear that they do not want to see any parade on the Twelfth of July given what happened in the past,\" he added.\n\n\"Any repeat of that is unthinkable.\n\n\"The agreement reached in 2016 must be respected and I'll be making that view clear to the Parades Commission on behalf of local residents and the SDLP.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Gerry Kelly said the development is \"deeply concerning\".\n\n\"Since 2016, residents have enjoyed peace and some semblance of normality in their lives thanks to the agreement reached between the residents and the loyal orders, and a lot of good work has been done by community and voluntary workers to improve cross-community relations,\" he said.\n\n\"I understand that (CARA) have lodged a protest application in opposition to this parade which we will support.\n\n\"Sinn F\u00e9in will continue to stand with residents in their opposition to this parade which contravenes the 2016 agreement, and we will be raising our serious concerns with the Parades Commission.\"\n\nLast year the Parades Commission ruled an application by a Ballysillan lodge to parade

one of Northern Ireland's most contentious parading routes has collapsed.\n\nThe march route, which crosses a section of the Crumlin Road that separates unionist and nationalist communities, has sparked violent protests in the past.\n\nAn agreement between the Orange Lodge and the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (Cara) in 2016 brought 3 years of almost nightly loyalist protests to an end.\n\nHere is how it all started in 2013.\n\nLoyalist protests began after a Parades Commission decision not to allow a return leg of an Orange parade to pass a section of the Crumlin road.\n\nThe commission said Orangemen could walk on the stretch of the Crumlin Road in the morning, but not in the evening.\n\nThe Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland called the decision \"ludicrous\" and damaging to community relations.\n\nThe DUP said many would see the Parades Commission decision as \"a reward for violence\", but Sinn F\u00e9in called it \"sensible\".\n\nTwo residents groups from the Ardoyne area called off planned protests against the proposed Orange Parade as \"a sign of good faith\".\n\nLoyalist campaigners vowed to keep protesting until the original parade is allowed to return past the Ardoyne shops.\n\nIn the same month, Police officers from the rest of the UK were brought in to support the PSNI with more than 550 parades, 43 of which were regarded as \"sensitive\".\n\nA legal challenge to the Parades Commission's ruling was dismissed by a High Court judge.\n\nUp to this point, policing the nightly demonstrations has so far cost more than \u00a318m.\n\nAn agreement was reached between the Orange Order and the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (Cara).\n\nCara agreed it would not object to any existing morning parades.\n\nIn return, the lodges agreed to a \"voluntary moratorium\" on applying for evening return parades.\n\nThe agreement stated: \"This moratorium would allow for a process between the lodges and Cara to seek agreement on future return parades and if agreement is achieved, the moratorium would be lifted.\"\n\nThe dispute cost an estimated \u00a322m to police over three years.\n\nProtests continued despite the agreement.\n\nMore than 200 people took part in a demonstration by another local residents group, the Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective (Garc), which passed off without incident.\n\nA loyalist protest also took place on Twaddell Avenue.\n\nThe Ballysillan lodge submitted and withdrew its application for a flashpoint parade at noon on Saturday 24 June.\n\nThe Parades Commission had ruled that it should stop short of the shops, at the junction of Crumlin Road and Wheatfield Gardens because walking any further would breach the agreement.\n\nThe commission said the application was \"a wanton disregard for the efforts made to achieve a local agreement and an egregious disregard for the six years of peace it secured.\"\n\n\"It serves only to heighten tensions in a period of political instability and risks serious public disorder,\" it added.\n\nIt also placed similar restrictions on applications for the Orange Order to march through Ardoyne on 12 July 2023.\n\nA residents' group in Ardoyne had told the commission the route requested was \"highly provocative\".\n\nThe agreement collapsed as the Orange Order, again, applies to march past Ardoyne shops on 12 July evening.\n\nThe Order claimed Cara had \"weaponised\" engagement and accused them of \"bad-faith dialogue.\"\n\nA nationalist residents' group says it has planned a protest in response.\n\nThe Parades Commission will rule on the matter on 3 July.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumlin_Road", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

"No appetite for disorder despite breakdown of parade deal, says senior officer", "body": "A senior police commander has said he does not detect an appetite for disorder at a parading flashpoint in Belfast despite the breakdown of a deal between Orangemen and nationalist residents.\n\nPSNI Assistant Chief Constable Bobby Singleton was commenting after the collapse of an agreement struck in 2016 to resolve what at the time was Northern Ireland's most volatile parading dispute, in the Woodvale/Ardoyne area of north Belfast.\n\nStormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long has also called for \"calm heads\" as she encouraged both sides to strive to find a resolution ahead of the high point of the loyal order summer marching season.\n\nThe flashpoint has previously witnessed serious loyalist and republican rioting when tensions linked to a contentious Orange march boiled over on the main date in the parading calendar - the Twelfth of July.\n\nA 24/7 loyalist protest camp was set up at the sectarian interface in 2013 when the Parades Commission - a government-appointed adjudication panel for controversial marches - prevented Orangemen belonging to three Orange lodges passing the nationalist Ardoyne along the Crumlin Road as they returned from traditional Twelfth commemorations.\n\nNightly protests were held in the nearby unionist Woodvale/Twaddell area in the years after that, with a protest parade every Saturday.\n\nThe policing operation at the site has cost in excess of \u00a320 million over three years.\n\nAfter protracted negotiations, an accord between the three lodges and the main nationalist residents group - the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (Cara) - was reached in 2016.\n\nIt saw the Orangemen complete the outstanding leg of their 2013 parade on a morning in September 2016, after which the loyalist camp at the interface was dismantled and all associated protests ended.\n\nFrom that point on, the lodges agreed not to apply for any more return parades on the Twelfth until a wider agreement on the issue was reached.\n\nIn return, Cara agreed not to protest at the lodges' already permitted outward parade on the morning of the Twelfth.\n\nThat deal has now fallen through, with Orangemen having applied to the Parades Commission for permission to parade past Ardoyne on the evening of the Twelfth.\n\nCara has applied to stage a protest in the area at the same time.\n\nThe commission will adjudicate on those applications on July 3.\n\nResponding to the developments, Mr Singleton said: \"Police are aware of heightened tensions following the breakdown in engagement between the respective parties in north Belfast, despite the heightened tensions we don't believe there is an appetite for disorder on any side.\n\n\"We will be prepared and will work with all parties irrespective of any decision made by the Parades Commission to deliver a public safety operation.\"\n\nMs Long was asked about the breakdown of the deal as she launched the Alliance Party's manifesto in Belfast on Thursday.\n\nShe said a summer of heightened tensions in the area was in no-one's interests.\n\n\"So my appeal is for calm, my appeal is for cool heads and my appeal is for long-term solutions,\" Ms Long said.\n\n\"We do not want to go back to the situation where we have constant tension at interface areas and constant tension on parades.\"\n\nCounty Grand Master of the Orange Order in Belfast Spencer Beattie accused residents' representatives in Ardoyne of \"bad faith\".\n\nHe said the \"voluntary moratorium\" on a return parade on the evening of the Twelfth was introduced pending a longer-term deal to facilitate such a parade in the future.\n\n\"This cynical and malicious refusal to allow the three local Orange lodges and their Protestant neighbours the right to return home is a flagrant breach of the agreement and a blatant disregard for the most fundamental of human rights,\" Mr Beattie said.\n\nCara expressed concern about the potential impact on community relations in the area.\n\n\"The people of the area have had peace and normality in their lives since 2016 and want that to continue into the future,\" the residents' association said in a statement.\n\nThe group said while it had applied to protest at the proposed evening parade it would not protest at the morning parades.\n\n\"Cross-community relations have been

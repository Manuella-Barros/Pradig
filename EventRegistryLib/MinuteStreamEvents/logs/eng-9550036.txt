Together, both partners have established a new Bitcoin mining facility that capitalizes on an innovative energy resource: stranded gas from oil fields.\n\nThis facility, situated in Rinc\u00f3n de Los Sauces in the province of Neuqu\u00e9n, is designed to transform what would otherwise be waste into a powerful energy source for high-intensity computing processes associated with Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe facility operates with a total power capacity of 7 megawatts (MW), supported by an additional 1 MW of backup power, housing 1,200 Bitcoin mining machines. It is powered by the Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant, collaboratively managed by YPF, Norwegian energy giant Equinor, and YPF Luz.\n\nThe energy for this mining operation comes from stranded gas -- natural gas that is liberated during oil extraction but not captured for sale or distribution, typically because it is not economically viable to transport it from remote or marginally productive fields.\n\nStranded gas usually poses a disposal problem, often being flared into the atmosphere, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. The new facility's approach not only prevents this environmental harm but also uses the gas to generate electricity, effectively making productive use of a previously wasted resource.\n\nAccording to recent studies, including a working paper from MIT, the repurposing of methane through techniques like those employed by GDA can reduce carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by between 25% and 63%. This is critical because methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for about a third of current global warming.\n\nAbdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President and Founder of GDA, emphasized the project's environmental and operational advantages in a statement: \"The opening of our first data center in South America is an important step in our geographic diversification efforts. This will be yet another opportunity to show the world that Bitcoin mining can have a positive effect on the environment and can be fully integrated into local communities.\"\n\nArgentina presents a unique landscape for such endeavors due to its substantial energy resources, favorable political climate, and a strong crypto ethos among its population. The country has been experiencing high inflation rates, which has increased the local populace's reliance on cryptocurrencies as a hedge against economic instability.\n\nMart\u00edn Mandarano, CEO of YPF Luz, also noted the project's strategic fit with Argentina's energy policies. \"This project with GDA allows us to bring YPF and Equinor, two companies committed to reducing the carbon footprint of their exploration activities, an adaptable and sustainable flare gas use solution,\" Mandarano stated. He further highlighted that YPF Luz had previously pioneered the generation of electricity for cryptocurrency mining from flare gas in 2022, positioning the company as a leader in innovative energy solutions.\n\nThe project also marks a significant point of expansion for GDA, which operates 20 industrial-scale data centers across North America, South America, Europe, and Central Asia, further cementing its position as a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry. With a total power capacity exceeding 500 MW globally, GDA continues to drive innovation in the integration of renewable and waste-derived energy sources into the BTC mining sector.", "source":

The partnership will establish a new Bitcoin (BTC) mining facility in the Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant, with 1,200 mining machines that use stranded gas for power generation.\n\nAccording to YPF Luz CEO Mart\u00edn Mandarano -- as reported by Forbes on May 7 -- the company has been generating electricity from mining since 2022. In this new partnership, the facility will have a total capacity of 7 MW, with an additional 1 MW backup. GDA Executive President Abdumalik Mirakhmedov stated that Argentina's pro-innovation climate for crypto has never been stronger.\n\nFurthermore, Mirakhmedov highlighted the significant portion of Argentina's population that already uses cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as inflation hedges.\n\n\"Although we've been considering expanding to Argentina for years, the political and pro-innovation climate the country has fostered for crypto - and Bitcoin specifically - has never been stronger than today. There's also a large percentage of the population in Argentina that already uses cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to hedge against high inflation. The bottom line is that crypto is a solution to these problems, and we're seeing that fact recognized by countries throughout Central and South America.\"\n\nWriting for Forbes, Javier Bastardo believes the new facility demonstrates Bitcoin mining's potential to mitigate the environmental impact of stranded gas while generating valuable returns. Importantly, according to the report, this initiative will not compromise the electricity needed for Argentina's internal demand.\n\n\"The new facility showcases two important elements of bitcoin mining's potential. On one hand, it helps mitigate the direct impact of stranded gas on the environment. However, other mitigation techniques don't include the second element: using these wasted resources to make some valuable return, in this case, through BTC. What is more significant in terms of the scalability of this kind of initiative is that it won't compromise the electricity needed to cover Argentina's internal demand.\"\n\nIn addition, GDA sees Argentina as an ideal starting point for its regional expansion in Latin America. The company is actively seeking more countries in the region to expand to, citing attractive electricity prices, temperature, development potential, and sustainable energy sources as key factors. Since Javier Milei took power in late 2023, Argentina's Bitcoin and crypto industry has grown significantly.\n\nSo far, the public sector is working on regulating the activity to comply with international standards and requirements. Meanwhile, companies, startups, and users are exploring ways to maintain the country's increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies. GDA's announcement underscores the importance Argentina may have for the Bitcoin mining industry in the coming years.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin miners have been facing record-low revenue due to the block subsidy halving on April 20. Essentially, mining companies now receive half the amount of BTC for the same production cost.\n\nHowever, the production cost has also increased, making the situation even worse for smaller players willing to mine Bitcoin.\n\nTherefore, electricity giants like YPF Luz, operating in low-cost environments like Argentina, have competitive advantages over other industry participants. For this reason, this reported partnership is paramount for Bitcoin's network security sustainability under these current challenges.", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vinicius_barbosa@finbold.com", "name": "Vinicius Barbosa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YPF", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YPF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(corporate_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President (corporate title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javier Milei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/BTC-adoption-alert-Argentinas-largest-electricity-company-to-mine-Bitcoin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550036", "eventUri": "eng-9550036", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 375, "textEnd": 380}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 3059, "textEnd": 3067}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

It has several exploratory oil drilling projects in Patagonia.\n\nExploratory oil drilling often releases associated gas. In the past, many oil firms have simply burned this off (a process known as \"flaring\").\n\nBut in many parts of the world, companies now use this gas to power crypto mining rigs via thermal plants.\n\nThe YPF deal will see the firms use a \"mining farm\" named Central T\u00e9rmica Bajo del Toro, located in Rinc\u00f3n de los Sauces, Neuqu\u00e9n.\n\nYPF was nationalized by the government in 2012 and has gone on to become one of the nation's largest energy companies in Argentina.\n\nThe firms will channel the gas to a thermal power plant with a total installed capacity of 8 MW.\n\nThey claimed the move would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make efficient use of energy, and monetize associated gas.\n\nYPF said the project would use gas that \"otherwise would have been vented into the atmosphere.\"\n\nAnd the oil firm said that this would help reduce the risks of the \"highly energy-intensive\" BTC mining industry. It added:\n\n\"[The project will allow Bitcoin mining] without affecting the availability of the national electrical energy network. [It will] contribute to a more sustainable solution.\"\n\nAbdumalik Mirakhmedov, the Executive President of GDA, said Argentina is \"an important country for Bitcoin mining.\"\n\nHe said that \"given its abundance of energy sources and its business-friendly environment,\" the nation was a natural pick for miners. Mirakhmedov added:\n\n\"The opening of our first data center in South America is an important step in our geographic diversification efforts. This will be yet another opportunity to show the world that Bitcoin mining can have a positive effect on the environment and can be fully integrated into local communities.\"\n\nGDA has around 20 Bitcoin mining farms in regions including North America, Europe, and Central Asia. The firm operates over 180,000 mining rigs worldwide.\n\nMirakhmedov hailed the move, GDA's first in South America, as \"an important step\" for the mining firm.\n\nYPF, meanwhile, has been working with crypto mining players since 2022, when it first began using associated gas to power mining rigs.\n\nAnd Equinor announced plans to incorporate crypto mining operations in sites on the Bakken oilfield in North Dakota in 2020.\n\nIn September 2023, fellow Argentina-based oil explorer Tecpetrol announced plans to operate a crypto mining \"farm\" in Western Argentina's Vaca Muerta oil field.", "source": {"uri": "cryptonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptonews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_petroleum_gas", "type":

It is specifically situated in Rinc\u00f3n de Los Sauces, Neuqu\u00e9n Province.\n\nThe facility, which boasts a total capacity of 7 MW with an additional 1 MW backup, will power 1,200 BTC mining machines. This initiative aims to monetize stranded gas, which is usually flared into the atmosphere as a byproduct of oil extraction. It does so by using this gas to generate electricity for Bitcoin mining. This method not only presents a profitable use for previously wasted resources. Also, it aligns with growing environmental concerns by reducing harmful emissions.\n\nMart\u00edn Mandarano, CEO of YPF Luz, highlighted that the company has been involved in generating electricity from mining operations since 2022. The new mining operation in Argentina leverages this experience, marking a significant expansion in its capabilities and geographic footprint.\n\nDuring an interview with Forbes, Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President of GDA, expressed enthusiasm about the venture. He noted that the political and innovation-driven environment in Argentina regarding cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has grown exceptionally favorable. Mirakhmedov also pointed out the high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins among the Argentine population, who use these digital assets to hedge against the country's high inflation rates.\n\nThis strategic move by GDA and YPF Luz is seen not just as a business expansion. But, also as a solution to broader economic challenges in the region. The adoption of cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation is a testament to its potential as a stabilizing force in economies plagued by financial instability.\n\nCountries in these regions are looking to innovative technologies like Bitcoin mining to address economic issues while also tapping into new technological advancements for energy utilization.\n\nThe information discussed by Altcoin Buzz is not financial advice.

Despite being one of the most competitive industries, hashrate keeps growing and so do the global operations to execute this important activity for the bitcoin network. Genesis Digital Assets Limited, one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the world, is part of this expansion.\n\nGDA announced an important agreement with the YPF Luz, a subsidiary of the largest electricity company from Argentina, YPF to open a new bitcoin mining facility that will operate using stranded gas. According to YPF Luz CEO Mart\u00edn Mandarano, the company has been generating electricity from mining since 2022, the local newspaper Ambito reported.\n\nThe operation is based in the Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant, operated by YPF Luz. It will power 1,200 bitcoin mining machines to monetize stranded gas that would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere. This is the first time the company has opened a mining operation in Latin America, specifically in Rinc\u00f3n de Los Sauces, in the Neuqu\u00e9n Province, with a total capacity of 7 MW and 1 MW backup.\n\n\"Although we've been considering expanding to Argentina for years, the political and pro-innovation climate the country has fostered for crypto - and Bitcoin specifically - has never been stronger than today. There's also a large percentage of the population in Argentina that already uses cryptocurrencies and stablecoins to hedge against high inflation. The bottom line is that crypto is a solution to these problems, and we're seeing that fact recognized by countries throughout Central and South America,\" Executive President of GDA Abdumalik Mirakhmedov explained to me in an interview.\n\nThe new facility showcases two important elements of bitcoin mining's potential. On one hand, it helps mitigate the direct impact of stranded gas on the environment. However, other mitigation techniques don't include the second element: using these wasted resources to make some valuable return, in this case, through BTC. What is more significant in terms of the scalability of this kind of initiative is that it won't compromise the electricity needed to cover Argentina's internal supply.\n\nWhile Latin America has not traditionally been a major hub for bitcoin mining, GDA's new facility in Argentina signals an important shift. Paraguay, Venezuela, and now Argentina could lead the charge. The company sees Argentina as an ideal starting point for its regional expansion, citing the country's favorable combination of characteristics. This move could pave the way for further industry growth in the region with other operators expanding.\n\n\"We are actively looking for more countries in the region to expand to, but we are currently focused on Argentina because it provides the ideal combination of attractive electricity prices, temperature, potential for development, and sustainable energy sources,\" Mirakhmedov said.\n\nSince Javier Milei took power in late 2023, Argentina's bitcoin and crypto industry have been on the move. The public sector is trying to regulate the activity to further comply with the Financial Action Task Force recommendations and the International Monetary Fund requirements, while companies, startups, and users are looking for ways to maintain the growing adoption.\n\nIt's unclear how this regulatory issue will be fixed, but GDA's announcement underscores the importance this country might have for the industry, especially for bitcoin miners.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

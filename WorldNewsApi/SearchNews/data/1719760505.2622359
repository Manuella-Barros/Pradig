{"id": 224999514, "title": "Democrats plan virtual meeting to get Biden on Ohio ballot: Capitol Letter", "text": "Rotunda Rumblings Problem solved: National Democrats on Tuesday said they have their own fix for a problem that threatens to keep President Joe Biden off Ohio\u2019s November ballot. Jeremy Pelzer and Andrew Tobias write that the Democrats will have a virtual vote before Ohio\u2019s Aug. 7 deadline to certify candidates and that the selection two weeks after the deadline at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will be ceremonial. Democrats are supposed to meet next week to schedule the vote. Bonus session: The plan crystallized as state lawmakers reconvened in Columbus to come up with their own legislative fix for the Biden ballot problem on orders from GOP Gov. Mike DeWine. Pelzer has details on the start of the special session, which DeWine called as a means to consider legislation that would push back the deadline that could keep Biden off the ballot and that would restrict foreign campaign contributions to state ballot issue campaigns. The Ohio Senate was pressing forward with that plan on Tuesday afternoon, with support from DeWine. The Ohio House introduced separate bills to address the issues. But whether Republican leaders in the two chambers come to an agreement remains to be seen. Cliff note: Federal officials have cleared ex-Ohio House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger, telling him in a recent letter that he is no longer the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. Tobias writes that Rosenberger on Tuesday shared a letter he received last week from Kenneth Parker, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, telling him that he was \u201cno longer\u201d the subject of an investigation. Rosenberger quit office in 2018 after it became public that the FBI had subpoenaed state records documenting his interaction with lobbyists for the payday-lending industry. He was never charged. Cutting class: Ohio law, backed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision dating back to the 1950s, permits school districts to adopt policies allowing students to leave school in the middle of the day for religious instruction, a concept known as released-time. One of the country\u2019s largest growing released time religious programs, LifeWise, is based in Ohio. A bill in the legislature would make it easier for LifeWise to grow in the state. Laura Hancock explores the history of released time, and what LifeWise \u2013 as well as its critics \u2013 think of the program. A companion story looks at released-time laws in neighboring states to Ohio. Stoned age: On Tuesday, several rules that will guide operations of Ohio\u2019s recreational marijuana program went into effect. One of those rules was rescinding patient and caregiver fees paid annually to the state from $50 and $25, respectively, to zero. Other rules put the state a step closer to authorizing the existing 124 medical dispensaries to serve both medical and adult-use customers, Hancock reports. Fatal shutoff: The Ohio Supreme Court ruled for Enbridge Energy, after the company cut off gas service to an elderly woman who soon thereafter died of hypothermia in January 2022. As Jake Zuckerman reports, the justices didn\u2019t rule on the merits of a negligence claim brought by the victim\u2019s estate. Rather, they ruled the family should have filed the case before the public utility regulators. Memorial anniversary: It took six years for Allied troops to triumph over Germany and Japan in World War II. Decades later, it took Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur 17 years to surmount the legislative and bureaucratic hurdles necessary to build a World War II Memorial on the National Mall, Sabrina Eaton reports. Kaptur was honored Saturday at a ceremony marking 20th anniversary of the memorial\u2019s dedication. Bipartisanship ranked: Ohio\u2019s Jim Jordan \u2013 whose House Speaker bid last year was torpedoed by more moderate colleagues \u2013 is the least bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to a new study that ranks the bipartisanship of every U.S. Congress member, Eaton writes. The organization said its 2023 ratings showed an intensely partisan Congress, though one that was slightly improved from recent years. Appeal to Heaven: U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson of Miami County is among a group of GOP Congress members, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who flies a Revolutionary war era \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag outside his office. The New York Times last week reported that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito flew the white flag with a green pine tree and the words \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d outside his beach house, describing it as \u201ca symbol carried on Jan. 6 and associated with a push for a more Christian-minded government.\u201d When asked about the flag last week, Davidson said he bought it from a Christian ministry and interprets its message to be \u201cbasically saying, \u2018God Help Us.\u2019 ... I guess it is political in some sense, recognizing the sovereignty of God, which is controversial for some people, I suppose.\u201d Bring back jobs: U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes of Akron last week joined a group of Democratic colleagues in introducing legislation called the \u201cBring Jobs Home Act\u201d, which would cut taxes for American companies that move jobs to the U.S. from another nation and close tax loopholes that reward companies who ship jobs abroad. \u201cFor too long, American companies have shipped jobs overseas, leading to less opportunities in our own communities,\u201d said a statement from Sykes. The bill would allow companies to qualify for a tax credit equal to 20% of the cost associated with bringing jobs and business activity back to the United States, and block companies from deducting outsourcing costs as moving expenses. Road show: State union leaders are continuing to say Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno wasn\u2019t being truthful when he said he\u2019d refused to sell Chinese-made Buick SUVs through his former network of car dealerships. Per the Sandusky Register, officials with the Ohio AFL-CIO issued a public statement on Friday citing the story telling Moreno they\u2019d never support him. The Moreno campaign says that Moreno has clearly said that while he previously sold the Envision, his decision to no longer sell them came in 2019, after General Motors announced it was closing plants in Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio and outsourcing production to China. Lobbying Lineup Five organizations that are lobbying on Senate Bill 101, a bipartisan measure that would eliminate the death penalty and changes the number of \u201cperemptory challenges\u201d given to each party before a trial. A challenge allows a juror to be dismissed without any reason given. 1. Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission 2. Ohio Council of Churches 3. Ohio Public Defender Commission 4. Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association 5. Ohio Association of Chiefs of Police On The Move Jason Knox has joined CJR Group in Columbus, where he will help manage federal and state government relations for the firm. He previously was vice president of federal and state public affairs for Paul Werth Associates. After organizing a multi-million dollar Cincinnati fundraiser for ex-President Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. JD Vance, a Cincinnati Republican, has organized a June 6 Silicon Valley Trump fundraiser with tickets starting at $50,000, Axios reports. Birthdays State Rep. Rachel Baker State Sen. Steve Wilson Straight From The Source \u201cFar too many Ohioans with disabilities do not have someone on the approved list who can assist them in returning their absentee ballot. This violates federal disability voting access laws. A voter with a disability should be able to choose whomever they want to assist them with their absentee ballot and especially common sense helpers like roommates and grandkids and in laws, people they\u2019ve known their whole lives and they may be relying on for other errands, like going to get the groceries or prescriptions.\u201d -Jen Miller of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, on groups asking a federal judge to rule on a lawsuit they filed late last year. The suit challenges a new state law that limits the list of people who can help a disabled voter turn in their absentee ballot, Ohio Public Radio\u2019s Karen Kasler reports.

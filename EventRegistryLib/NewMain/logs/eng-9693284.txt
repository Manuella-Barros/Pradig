AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- An officer in upstate New York fatally shot a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police while carrying a replica handgun, authorities said Saturday.\n\nThe shooting occurred around 10:15 p.m. Friday after officers stopped two youths for an unspecified \"police investigation,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said.\n\nOne of them, identified by police as Nyah Mway, allegedly ran from the officers and \"displayed\" a handgun that was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. \"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nWilliams cautioned that the bystander video does not portray the event in its entirety.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting, whose names were not immediately released, were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe shooting has roiled Utica, a city some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan that is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nWilliams pledged to release unedited video of the officers' body-worn cameras but had not done so as of Saturday evening.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general, which did not respond to a request for comment Saturday, will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.",

The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nWilliams pledged to release unedited video of the officers' body-worn cameras but had not done so as of Saturday evening.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general, which did not respond to a request for comment Saturday, will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@hjnews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "philip_marcelo@hjnews.com", "name": "Philip Marcelo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aung San Suu Kyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/hjnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/12/212d6fd7-29ca-50f7-8e3c-4c00a32b69cd/66805e43ad88f.image.jpg?crop=1930%2C1013%2C58%2C0&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

While the authorities were questioning the teens, one of them fled on foot, police said.\n\nAs the victim ran, police spotted what \"appeared to be a handgun,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said in a Saturday morning news conference, during which he was frequently interrupted by outraged community members. One of the officers fired his gun and struck the teen, described as an Asian male.\n\n\"A Utica police officer ultimately discharged his firearm once, striking the male, during a ground struggle,\" Williams said.\n\nHe was given immediate first aid by officers on scene and was brought to Wynn Hospital, where he died from his wounds, Williams said.\n\nFollowing the shooting, according to Williams, officers recovered a pellet gun resembling a Glock 17 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"This replica handgun was ultimately found to be a pellet gun,\" Williams disclosed.\n\nUtica police later identified the deceased 13-year-old as Nyah Mway.\n\nThe officer who fatally shot Mway was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the department. Two other officers, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti, were also involved in the incident, police said.\n\nIn their release Saturday night, police said that the three officers were patrolling the area in response to at least two recent robberies \"in which the suspects were described as Asian males who brandished a black in color firearm and forcibly demanded and stole property from victims\" -- the latest of which had occurred Thursday.\n\nThe three officers approached the two teens because \"they matched the robbery suspects' descriptions and were in the immediate vicinity of the previous robbery at nearly the same time of day,\" police said.\n\nPolice Saturday night also released several minutes of footage from the body cameras of all three officers, along with a photo of the replica handgun which was recovered.\n\nIn the footage, the teen takes off running from the scene almost immediately after being stopped by the officers. While running, he appears to briefly point what police say was the replica gun at the pursuing officers.\n\nWithin about 15 to 20 seconds, the footage shows Patterson tackle Mway on a sidewalk, and while the two wrestle on the ground, Husnay appears to fire a single shot.\n\nSeparate cell phone video of the incident captured by a neighbor has been obtained by CBS News. Regarding the video, police said in a statement that it was \"aware of a video of the incident circulating on social media platforms, which does not portray the incident in its entirety.\"\n\nThe New York attorney general's office also announced Saturday night that it has opened an investigation into the shooting.\n\nUtica police said it is conducting its own investigation. The chief said during the news conference the three officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nAn interpreter was at the contentious news conference to translate for the victim's family and community members. At one point, Utica Mayor Michael Galime took the microphone, calling for calm.\n\n\"We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood,\" Galime said.\n\nThe ethnicity of the victim's family has not been provided, but Utica has resettled large numbers of refugees in recent years. According to the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees, one of the largest numbers of Asian refugees Utica has resettled are from Burma, including from the Karen ethnic group, as well as other groups. Other Asian refugees include Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodians along with Bosnians, Dominicans and more, the center said. Just over 19% of the once rapidly declining industrial city is now foreign-born, the center said.\n\n\"This tragedy reminds us of the tremendous challenges our community faces, particularly our partners in law enforcement, who tirelessly strive to ensure our streets remain safe,\" Utica City School District interim superintendent Dr. Kathleen Davis said in a statement Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_Valley_region", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohawk Valley region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica_City_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utica City School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bosnians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (police)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/29/a1b26f92-5dba-452d-9c4a-ebe0c06df568/thumbnail/1200x630/363b727faee94ee5b45322872d7af37d/1719705357569.png?v=a23cb4bdf4fa7f3cb72e5118085577f9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nVideo released late Saturday shows an officer in upstate New York fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police and pointed a replica handgun at them.\n\nThe teen was killed late Friday in Utica after officers in the city about 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths a little after 10 p.m. in connection with an armed robbery investigation, police said.\n\nThe youths, both 13, matched the descriptions of the robbery suspects and were in the same area at around the same time the day after, police said. One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two -- identified by police as as Nyah Mway -- runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police department released the body camera video following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aung San Suu Kyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/06/Police-Shooting-2024-06-e270682c3c295c8ab21834fc155a8c14.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Nyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority. Karens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.

Police Say He Pointed A Replica Gun", "body": "Police investigate the scene of Friday nights shooting in Utica, N.Y., early Saturday, June 29, 2024. An officer shot and killed a teen fleeing while pointing a replica gun, police said Saturday. (Kenny Lacy Jr./Syracuse.com via AP)\n\nBy PHILIP MARCELO and STEFANIE DAZIO Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Video released late Saturday shows an officer in upstate New York fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police and pointed a replica handgun at them.\n\nThe teen was killed a little after 10 p.m. Friday in Utica after officers in the city about 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths in connection with an armed robbery investigation, police said.\n\nThe youths, both 13, matched the descriptions of the robbery suspects and were in the same area at around the same time the day after, police said. One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two, identified by police as as Nyah Mway, runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police body camera video shows a chaotic scene.\n\nNyah Mway points the replica handgun at the officers while he runs from them. The officers scream \"gun!\" to each other as they run. Patterson then tackles and punches Nyah Mway, and as the two are wrestling on the ground, Husnay opens fire.\n\nOfficers initially thought Nyah Mway may have shot himself, and Patterson says, \"I don't know if he shot me.\" It is not clear whether he is referring to Nyah Mway or his fellow officer. Patterson was not struck.\n\nBystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back: \"We're trying to save him right now!\"\n\nThe other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting.\n\nDuring his \"public safety statement,\" a brief interview typically done in the aftermath of a police shooting to ensure there is no additional threat, Husnay said he fired one round \"straight towards the ground.\" He did not know whether Nyah Mway had fired at the officers but said he thought the weapon was a 22-caliber handgun.\n\nThe police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city with a population of 65,000. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, was identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority among the groups warring with the military rulers of Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nA tense news conference Saturday ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting an internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\n___\n\nDazio reported from Los Angeles.

One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two -- identified by police as as Nyah Mway -- runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\" A bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police body camera video shows a chaotic scene.\n\nNyah Mway points the replica handgun at the officers while he runs from them. The officers scream \"gun!\" to each other as they run.\n\nPatterson then tackles and punches Nyah Mway, and as the two are wrestling on the ground, Husnay opens fire.\n\nOfficers initially thought Nyah Mway may have shot himself, and Patterson says, \"I don't know if he shot me.\" It is not clear whether he is referring to Nyah Mway or his fellow officer. Patterson was not struck.\n\nBystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back: \"We're trying to save him right now!\" The other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting.\n\nThe police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "telanganatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telangana Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "telangana_today@telanganatoday.com", "name": "Telangana Today", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nyah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nyah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aung San Suu Kyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Watch-NY-officer-fatally-shoots-13-year-old-on-ground-Police-cite-replica-gun.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The officer who fired the shot has not been publicly identified.\n\nAt City Hall on Saturday, people shouted down officials' remarks at times, while at other moments people pleaded for silence so members of the Karen community could hear an interpreter's translations.\n\nMayor Michael Galime said the city will be transparent in its investigation and he and other officials will meet privately with the teen's family and other community members.\n\n\"We are holding this press conference so you can all be in this room,\" he said. \"We understand the weight of this situation, and we want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.

The office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nThe police department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training, according to Williams.\n\nThe officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with protocol, he added.\n\nWilliams said the department is aware of a video of the incident that has circulated on social media but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" he said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nMore from this section\n\nHitPaw Voice

Police say he pointed a replica gun", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Video released late Saturday shows an officer in upstate New York fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police and pointed a replica handgun at them.\n\nThe teen was killed late Friday in Utica after officers in the city about 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths a little after 10 p.m. for an unspecified \"police investigation,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said.\n\nOne of them, identified by police as as Nyah Mway, ran and pointed what appeared to be a handgun at the pursuing officers, authorities said. It was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting, whose names were not immediately released, were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police department released the body camera video following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe state attorney general will lead the investigation into the shooting and determine if it was justified.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general, which did not respond to a request for comment Saturday, will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\n___\n\nDazio reported from Los Angeles.

While running, he briefly pointed what police described as the pellet gun at the pursuing officers.\n\nWithin 15 to 20 seconds of the chase beginning, the footage shows Patterson tackling Mway on a sidewalk. During the struggle, Husnay approached and fired a single shot.\n\nPolice acknowledged the existence of a separate cell phone video of the incident circulating on social media, stating it does not capture the entire sequence of events.\n\nThe New York attorney general's office announced Saturday night that it has initiated an investigation into the shooting.\n\nUtica police stated they are conducting their own investigation and have placed all three officers on paid administrative leave.\n\nAn interpreter was present at the tense news conference to translate for the victim's family and community members. Utica Mayor Michael Galime intervened, urging calm.\n\nGalime emphasised the gravity of the situation and expressed a commitment to thorough understanding of every aspect.\n\nThe ethnicity of the victim's family was not disclosed, but Utica has resettled significant numbers of refugees in recent years, including many Asian refugees from Burma, such as the Karen ethnic group, as well as others like Vietnamese, Thai, and Cambodians. The city also hosts Bosnian and Dominican refugees, among others.\n\nThe Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees noted that just over 19% of Utica's population is foreign-born, highlighting the

Police say he pointed a replica gun", "body": "In Utica, New York, a tragic incident unfolded as police fatally shot 13-year-old Nyah Mway, mistaking his replica handgun for a real weapon during an armed robbery investigation. Bodycam footage shows Nyah fleeing and allegedly pointing the replica at officers before being shot in the chest during a struggle. Despite immediate aid, he succumbed to his injuries. The shooting has sparked outcry and scrutiny, with officers placed on leave pending investigations by both the police department and state attorney general to determine its justification.Video released late Saturday shows an officer in upstate New York fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police and pointed a replica handgun at them.\n\nThe teen was killed late Friday in Utica after officers in the city about 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths a little after 10 p.m. in connection with an armed robbery investigation, police said.\n\nThe youths, both 13, matched the descriptions of robbers and were in the same area the following day, police said. One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two - identified by police as as Nyah Mway - runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police department released the body camera video following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned.

Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nOne of the officers fired a single shot at the teen \"during a ground struggle,\" striking in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nHe was identified as Nyah Mway, a 13-year-old Karen refugee born in Myanmar and an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, Lt. Michael Curley, a department spokesperson, confirmed later Saturday.\n\nUtica, a city of more than 65,000 residents located along the Mohawk River, is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nKathleen Davis, interim superintendent of the Utica City School District, offered condolences to the victim's family in a statement posted online.\n\nDavis expressed \"profound sadness\" over the \"tragic and senseless loss\" and also offered support to \"our partners in law enforcement, who tirelessly strive to ensure our streets remain safe.\"\n\nWilliams, the police chief, declined to provide more details about what prompted the stop or preceded the shooting, saying that will be part of the investigation. Officers recovered a replica of a GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine at the scene, he added.\n\n\"It is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Curley said via email later, when asked to elaborate about the weapon. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nWilliams said that in the coming days the department will release a report on the incident as well as the full body camera video from the officers who were involved. The officer who fired the shot has not been publicly identified.\n\nAt City Hall on Saturday, people shouted down officials' remarks at times, while at other moments people pleaded for silence so members of the Karen community could hear an interpreter's translations.\n\nMayor Michael Galime said the city will be transparent in its investigation and he and other officials will meet privately with the teen's family and other community members.\n\n\"We are holding this press conference so you can all be in this room,\" he said. \"We understand the weight of this situation, and we want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood. Everything will be released, and everyone in this room and the entire community will have access to all of that information.\"\n\nWilliams said the Office of the New York State Attorney General will lead the investigation and determine if it was justified. The office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nThe police department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training, according to Williams.\n\nThe officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with protocol, he added.\n\nWilliams said the department is aware of a video of the incident that has circulated on social media but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party

What we know now is at approximately 10:18 p.m. Friday, police say officers conducted a stop of two juveniles on the 900 block of Shaw Street related to an ongoing investigation.\n\nPolice say when officers made an attempt to stop the two individuals, one of them fled on foot and as he was doing so, displayed what appeared to officers to be a handgun. As a result, a Utica Police officer discharged his weapon and shot the young child, who is described as an asian male. Police say he was immediately transported to Wynn Hospital where life saving efforts were attempted, but eventually the 13-year-old succumbed to his injuries.\n\nIn an initial release the Utica Police Department gave thoughts and prayers to everyone involved including the family of the victim and the family of the individual involved.\n\nOn Saturday morning at 10 a.m. Utica Police held a press conference at city hall that included a large group of citizens who were angry with the situation and making their anger known. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams took the podium to read the details of the case and was met with jeers and shouts as he read the circumstances of the case. One woman could be heard saying the family of the victim was present at the press conference.\n\nMayor Michael Galime had to interject so that the crowd would calm down and listen in the effort of transparency. Chief Williams began again. Williams read the statement of what occurred aloud again and announced that in the subsequent investigation a replica handgun that turned out to be a pellet gun was found at the scene where the 13-year-old was shot.\n\nWhile they have not yet, Chief Williams says the name of the officer involved will be released in a short period of time as they deem appropriate in the course of their investigation. During the course of an officer involved shooting, the Attorney General's Office will be investigating the incident. They will determine if there was a criminal act and if the officer was justified in the shooting death. There will also be an investigation through the Professional Standards Unit.\n\nThe officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay, as with any officer involved shooting and Chief Williams says for the sake of transparency, body worn camera footage will be released in addition to other available videos per the investigation.\n\nWIBX would like to thank Antoine Spratt, an independent journalist, for live streaming the press conference which you can see below,\n\nThis is a devastating story that is sending shockwaves through the community. The plight of youth violence in the city has come to a tragic head and action needs to be taken. There are very few details right now that we know for sure and it's important that we allow for proper investigations to be conducted.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nAn officer in upstate New York fatally shot a 13-year-old who was running with a \"realistic appearing firearm,\" authorities said Saturday.\n\nUtica Police Chief Mark Williams said the shooting happened Friday night after officers in the city about 240 miles northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths a little after 10 p.m.\n\nILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO ALLEGEDLY SHOT 2 NYPD OFFICERS AT 'POINT-BLANK RANGE' INDICTED ON 20 CHARGES\n\nOne of them fled on foot and pointed what appeared to be a handgun at the officers, he said during a news conference at Utica City Hall. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nOne of the officers fired a single shot at the teen \"during a ground struggle,\" striking in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nHe was identified as Nyah Mway, a 13-year-old Karen refugee born in Myanmar and an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, Lt. Michael Curley, a department spokesperson, confirmed later Saturday.\n\nUtica, a city of more than 65,000 residents located along the Mohawk River, is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nKathleen Davis, interim superintendent of the Utica City School District, offered condolences to the victim's family in a statement posted online.\n\nDavis expressed \"profound sadness\" over the \"tragic and senseless loss\" and also offered support to \"our partners in law enforcement, who tirelessly strive to ensure our streets remain safe.\"\n\nWilliams, the police chief, declined to provide more details about what prompted the stop or preceded the shooting, saying that will be part of the investigation. Officers recovered a replica of a GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine at the scene, he added.\n\n\"It is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Curley said via email later, when asked to elaborate about the weapon. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nWilliams said that in the coming days the department will release a report on the incident as well as the full body camera video from the officers who were involved. The officer who fired the shot has not been publicly identified.\n\nAt City Hall on Saturday, people shouted down officials' remarks at times, while at other moments people pleaded for silence so members of the Karen community could hear an interpreter's translations.\n\nMayor Michael Galime said the city will be transparent in its investigation and he and other officials will meet privately with the teen's family and other community members.\n\n\"We are holding this press conference so you can all be in this room,\" he said. \"We understand the weight of this situation, and we want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood. Everything will be released, and everyone in this room and the entire community will have access to all of that information.\"\n\nWilliams said the Office of the New York State Attorney General will lead the investigation and determine if it was justified. The office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nThe police department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training, according to Williams.\n\nThe officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with protocol, he added.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWilliams said the department is aware of a video of the incident that has circulated on social media but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to

One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two -- identified by police as Nyah Mway -- runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt.

It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police body camera video shows a chaotic scene.\n\nNyah Mway points the replica handgun at the officers while he runs from them. The officers scream \"gun!\" to each other as they run.\n\nPatterson then tackles and punches Nyah Mway, and as the two are wrestling on the ground, Husnay opens fire.\n\nOfficers initially thought Nyah Mway may have shot himself, and Patterson says, \"I don't know if he shot me.\" It is not clear whether he is referring to Nyah Mway or his fellow officer. Patterson was not struck.\n\nBystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back: \"We're trying to save him right now!\"\n\nThe other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting.\n\nThe police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult

Police and Utica Mayor Michael Galime held a press conference Saturday morning at Utica City Hall that was attended by a large number of the local Burmese community. The press conference was interrupted several times by the agitated crowd in attendance.\n\nAccording to Utica Police, several officers from their Crime Prevention Unit were conducting a stop of two males in the 900 block of Shaw Street, near Lincoln Ave. on the city's westside. Police say that their presence and the stop was part of an ongoing investigation. Police said that they could not divulge the nature of that investigation at the time of the press conference.\n\nJust before 10:18PM Friday, one of the two people stopped, both teenage boys, took off running and was chased by three officers. Video that been making the rounds on social media show a person dressed in dark colored clothing running away from police. One officer catches the person and tackles them to the ground. Two more uniformed police officers quickly follow. With the person on the ground, one officer is on top of that person, a second officer comes up behind them on the ground. The third officer is standing near the feet of those on the ground. The first officer in the foot pursuit appears to swing a punch at the person on the ground. Then a shot is heard and the officers step back.\n\nOne shot was fired. Police have not disclosed where on his body the deceased was hit. Scanner traffic from Friday night indicated that it was a gunshot wound to the chest. Police began CPR on the juvenile. He was taken to Wynn Hospital where he passed away.\n\nEyewitness News does not have the required permission from the owner of the video that has been circulated on social media in order to show it to you.\n\nAt the press conference Saturday morning Utica Police said that they will be releasing the body worn camera footage soon, as well as other pertinent video.\n\nPolice recovered a replica GLOCK handgun that they say was in possession of the deceased. Photos of the replica gun shown to Eyewitness News were of a gun that is indistinguishable from a real handgun without handling the weapon and examining it.\n\nThe City Hall Press Conference was held in an attempt to put forward transparency in an emotional situation. A large number of members of the community, particularly from the local Burmese community, were in attendance. Also at City Hall was the family of the deceased.\n\nThe Press Conference became rowdy at times with several members of the community shouting down the officials speaking and an interpreter provided by The Center. Several people who did not appear to be part of the Burmese community were part of the crowd shouting at officials.\n\nBefore the press conference concluded, Mayor Galime and the interpreter spoke with the family members of the deceased. The boy's mother was very upset.\n\nAs is mandated by state law, the New York State Attorney General's office has been called in to investigate the officer involved shooting. The State Attorney General's Special Investigation unit will take the lead in the criminal investigation of this incident. Utica Police will also conduct an investigation to focus on policy and procedures regarding the situation.\n\nThe Utica City School District put out a release concerning the death of one of their students. The district is offering support to members of the school district who may need help as a result of this situation.\n\nThe name of the deceased and the officers involved have not yet been released. Three Utica Police Officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid leave. That is standard in such situations.\n\nEyewitness News will update you with the latest reliable information as it becomes available.", "source": {"uri": "cnyhomepage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNYhomepage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_coyne@cnyhomepage.com", "name": "Tom Coyne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica_City_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utica City FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lincoln, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eyewitness News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica_City_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utica City School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cnyhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/UPD-NIGHT-TIME.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- An officer in upstate New York fatally shot a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police while carrying a replica handgun, authorities said Saturday.\n\nThe shooting occurred around 10:15 p.m. Friday after officers stopped two youths for an unspecified \"police investigation,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said.\n\nOne of them, identified by police as Nyah Mway, allegedly ran from the officers and \"displayed\" a handgun that was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. \"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nWilliams cautioned that the bystander video does not portray the event in its entirety.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting, whose names were not immediately released, were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe shooting has roiled Utica, a city some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan that is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts.

The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nWilliams pledged to release unedited video of the officers' body-worn cameras but had not done so as of Saturday evening.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training.

Police say he pointed a replica gun", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Video released late Saturday shows an officer in upstate New York fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police and pointed a replica handgun at them.\n\nThe teen was killed late Friday in Utica after officers in the city about 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths a little after 10 p.m. in connection with an armed robbery investigation, police said.\n\nThe youths, both 13, matched the descriptions of robbers and were in the same area the following day, police said. One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two -- identified by police as as Nyah Mway -- runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police department released the body camera video following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nDazio reported from Los Angeles.

The teen was killed a little after 10pm Friday in Utica after officers stopped two youths in connection with an armed robbery investigation, reports the AP. The youths, both 13, matched the descriptions of the robbery suspects and were in the same area at around the same time the day after, police said. The body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two, identified by police as as Nyah Mway, runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. The officers believed it was a handgun, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun. \"During a ground struggle,\" one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said. The teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died. The replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" said police rep Lt. Michael Curley. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay. The police body camera video shows Nyah Mway point the replica handgun at the officers while he runs from them. The officers scream \"gun!\" to each other as they run. Patterson then tackles and punches Nyah Mway, and as the two are wrestling on the ground, Husnay opens fire. Bystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back: \"We're trying to save him right now!\" The police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica. Nyah Mway, who local reports said was an 8th-grader at Donovan Middle School, was identified as a refugee born in Myanmar.

Everything will be released and everyone in this room and the entire community will have access to all of that information.\"\n\nWilliams said the Office of the New York State Attorney General will lead the investigation into the shooting and will determine if it was justified.\n\nSpokespersons for state Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nIn the meantime, the officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay until further notice, in keeping with protocol during such shootings, Williams said.\n\nThe department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed department policies and training, he said.\n\nWilliams said the department is also aware of a video circulating on social media of the incident but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" he said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nOne of the officers fired a single shot at the teen \"during a ground struggle,\" striking him in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen, who he described as a 13-year-old Asian male, was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died from his injuries, the police chief said.\n\nWilliams declined to provide more details about what prompted the stop or preceded the shooting, saying that will be part of the ongoing investigation. Officers, he said, recovered a replica GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine from the scene.\n\n\"It is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley said in an email to The Associated Press later, when asked to elaborate about the weapon. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's. \"\n\nWilliams said the department would release the identities of the officer and the youth later in addition to photos of the weapon. Over the next several days, he said, the department will be releasing a report providing a \"comprehensive overview of the events\" as well as the full body camera footage from the officers who were involved.\n\nAudience members shouted down officials' remarks at times, while at moments people implored the rest of the crowd to quiet down so members of the Myanmar community could hear the responses translated by an interpreter in Karen.\n\nMayor Michael Galime stressed the city would be transparent in its investigation, adding that he and other officials would be meeting privately with the youth's family and other community members to answer their questions.\n\n\"We are holding this press conference so you can all be in this room,\" he said. \"We understand the weight of this situation and we want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood. Everything will be released and everyone in this room and the entire community will have access to all of that information.\"\n\nWilliams said the Office of the New York State Attorney General will lead the investigation into the shooting and will determine if it was justified.\n\nSpokespersons for state Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nIn the meantime, the officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay until further notice, in keeping with protocol during such shootings, Williams said.\n\nThe department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed department policies and training, he said.\n\nWilliams said the department is also aware of a video circulating on social media of the incident but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nFather who lost two sons in 737 Max crash awaits to hear if US will prosecute

One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two -- identified by police as as Nyah Mway -- runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers. The officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. \"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\" A bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police body camera video shows a chaotic scene. Nyah Mway points the replica handgun at the officers while he runs from them. The officers scream \"gun!\" to each other as they run.\n\nPatterson then tackles and punches Nyah Mway, and as the two are wrestling on the ground, Husnay opens fire.\n\nOfficers initially thought Nyah Mway may have shot himself, and Patterson says, \"I don't know if he shot me.\" It is not clear whether he is referring to Nyah Mway or his fellow officer. Patterson was not struck.\n\nBystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back: \"We're trying to save him right now!\" The other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting. The police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city of more than 65,000 located some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority. Karens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule. During a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance. The police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said.

Police say he pointed a replica gun - Sentinel Colorado", "body": "NEW YORK | Video released late Saturday shows an officer in upstate New York fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police and pointed a replica handgun at them.\n\nThe teen was killed a little after 10 p.m. Friday in Utica after officers in the city about 240 miles northwest of Manhattan stopped two youths in connection with an armed robbery investigation, police said.\n\nThe youths, both 13, matched the descriptions of the robbery suspects and were in the same area at around the same time the day after, police said. One was also walking in the road, a violation of state traffic law.\n\nThe body camera video released by police captures an officer saying he needs to pat them down to ensure they don't have any weapons in their possession. Immediately one of the two, identified by police as as Nyah Mway, runs away.\n\nAuthorities froze frames of the video where a running Nyah Mway appears to point the gun at the pursuing officers. Police also edited the video to insert a red circle around the weapon to show it to viewers.\n\nThe officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine.\n\n\"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nThe officer who fired his gun was identified as Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the agency. Husnay and Officers Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe police body camera video shows a chaotic scene.\n\nNyah Mway points the replica handgun at the officers while he runs from them. The officers scream \"gun!\" to each other as they run. Patterson then tackles and punches Nyah Mway, and as the two are wrestling on the ground, Husnay opens fire.\n\nOfficers initially thought Nyah Mway may have shot himself, and Patterson says, \"I don't know if he shot me.\" It is not clear whether he is referring to Nyah Mway or his fellow officer. Patterson was not struck.\n\nBystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back: \"We're trying to save him right now!\"\n\nThe other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting.\n\nDuring his \"public safety statement,\" a brief interview typically done in the aftermath of a police shooting to ensure there is no additional threat, Husnay said he fired one round \"straight towards the ground.\" He did not know whether Nyah Mway had fired at the officers but said he thought the weapon was a 22-caliber handgun.\n\nThe police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city with a population of 65,000. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, was identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority among the groups warring with the military rulers of Myanmar, the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nA tense news conference Saturday ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting an internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nDazio reported from Los Angeles.

It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma.

The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\n___\n\nDazio reported from Los Angeles.

approached because they \"matched the robbery suspects' descriptions\", police said.\n\nOne of them ran before pointing what appeared to be a handgun at the officers, Utica police chief Mark Williams

family.\n\n\"We will continue to be as transparent and accessible to the family and community as legally allowed as this process continues,\" the department said on Facebook.\n\nIt identified the officers involved as Patrick Husnay, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti, who have been placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\n\"Officer Husnay is the officer that fired his duty weapon, striking the juvenile,\" the department said.\n\n\"As will be illustrated\" in body-worn camera (BWC) footage, \"when the officers asked and went to pat frisk Nyah Mway he immediately fled on foot\", it added.\n\n\"While fleeing he produced a replica Glock pellet gun from the front of his body, and during the 51 and 53-second mark on officer Patterson's BWC, points the weapon directly at Officer

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- An officer in upstate New York fatally shot a 13-year-old boy who had been tackled to the ground after he ran from police while carrying a replica handgun, authorities said Saturday.\n\nThe shooting occurred around 10:15 p.m. Friday after officers stopped two youths for an unspecified \"police investigation,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said.\n\nOne of them, identified by police as Nyah Mway, allegedly ran from the officers and \"displayed\" a handgun that was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. \"During a ground struggle\" with the teen, one of the officers fired a single shot that struck the boy in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nThe replica gun carried by the teen \"is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nWilliams cautioned that the bystander video does not portray the event in its entirety.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting, whose names were not immediately released, were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe shooting has roiled Utica, a city some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan that is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nWilliams pledged to release unedited video of the officers' body-worn cameras but had not done so as of Saturday evening.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general, which did not respond to a request for comment Saturday, will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohawk River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aung San Suu Kyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20240630010648/6680b960023d1607a07b3daejpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

But the message clearly hasn't gotten out to everyone who needs to hear it. The uninformed masses included a 13-year-old boy in the upstate New York city of Utica. The teen was out with a friend wandering the streets on Friday evening when three police officers stopped them for questioning regarding recent robberies in the residential neighborhood where they were walking. The teen in question, named Nyah Mway decided to flee from the police on foot. He then drew what appeared to be a handgun and pointed it at the pursuing officers. A scuffle on the ground ensued. At that point, one of the officers drew his own service revolver and fired one shot at the boy, striking him. He was taken to a local hospital where he later died from the gunshot wound. The boy's firearm was later determined to be a replica, (it wasn't actually a replica, but more on that in a moment) drawing reported outrage from some members of the community. (CBS News)\n\nPolice Friday night fatally shot a 13-year-old boy following a foot chase in a residential neighborhood in the upstate New York city of Utica after the teen displayed what appeared to be a gun, authorities said. Police later determined the teen was carrying a replica handgun.\n\nThree officers stopped the two teenagers at around 10 p.m. local time Friday as part of an investigation into several recent robberies, Utica police said in a news release Saturday night. While the authorities were questioning the teens, one of them fled on foot, police said.\n\nAs the victim ran, police spotted what \"appeared to be a handgun,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said in a Saturday morning news conference, during which he was frequently interrupted by outraged community members. One of the officers fired his gun and struck the teen, described as an Asian male.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this story that it's difficult to even know where to begin. First of all, what was a 13-year-old child doing walking around the city unsupervised at 10:00 pm on a Friday night? Where were his parents or guardians? Also, the CBS coverage of this story isn't entirely accurate in calling the boy's weapon a \"replica.\" It was found to be a pellet gun designed to resemble a Glock 17 with a detachable magazine. It almost certainly wouldn't have been lethal if it had been fired at the police, but it was still technically a weapon.\n\nThat brings us to the question of why anyone would decide to take a realistic-looking pellet gun out with them into the city. That's only going to make other people nervous and some of them may turn out to be armed themselves. Unless the boy was thinking of using it in an attempted robbery, there was no reason to do that. If you pull something that looks like a firearm on someone - particularly the police - they are going to respond accordingly. That's what happened to Nyah Mway and now he is no longer among the living.\n\nThis wasn't some case of the police randomly stopping children and shaking them down. The police were in that neighborhood because there were recent incidents involving what were described as \"two young Asian males\" who had robbed pedestrians at gunpoint, brandishing what was described as a black handgun. The two teens matched the description that victims and witnesses provided to the police, so that's why they were reportedly stopped for questioning.\n\nCommunity members may be \"outraged\" by this police shooting, but many of them seem to have been responding to a video taken by a neighbor that quickly went viral on social media. The neighbor's video only catches the end of the encounter, but all three police were wearing body cameras and they recorded the entire incident. We don't know and may never know if Nyah Mway was involved in the recent gunpoint robberies, but it certainly sounds as if he was off to a bad start in life after emigrating to New York with his family. Also, his decision to pull a realistic firearm and point it at the police officers doesn't speak well of his judgment or motives. All of the people currently expressing outrage should take the time to review all of the evidence before passing judgment. They should also be asking where his parents were at that time and why he was being allowed to run wild. If anyone is to blame for his death, it would appear that the parents or guardians were far more at fault than the police.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellet_(air_gun)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pellet (air gun)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2014/297/766b4d0f-fd6c-4715-8fe2-02b55802036d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nOne of the officers fired a single shot at the teen \"during a ground struggle,\" striking him in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, the chief said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, confirmed the name later Saturday.\n\nUtica, a city of more than 65,000 residents located along the Mohawk River, is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma.

Officers recovered a replica of a GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine at the scene, he added.\n\n\"It is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Curley said via email later, when asked to elaborate about the weapon. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nWilliams said that in the coming days the department will release a report on the incident as well as the full body camera video from the officers who were involved. The officer who fired the shot has not been publicly identified.\n\nAt City Hall on Saturday, people shouted down officials' remarks at times, while at other moments people pleaded for silence so members of the Karen community could hear an interpreter's translations.\n\nMayor Michael Galime said the city will be transparent in its investigation and he and other officials will meet privately with the teen's family and other community members.\n\n\"We are holding this press conference so you can all be in this room,\" he said. \"We understand the weight of this situation, and we want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood. Everything will be released, and everyone in this room and the entire community will have access to all of that information.\"\n\nWilliams said the Office of the New York State Attorney General will lead the investigation and determine if it was justified. The office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nThe police department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training, according to Williams.\n\nThe officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with protocol, he added.\n\nWilliams said the department is aware of a video of the incident that has circulated on social media but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" he said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Police say the boy pointed what officers thought was a gun at them but it turned out to be a pellet gun.\n\nUtica Police Chief Mark Williams said Saturday at a news conference that the boy was shot around 10:18 p.m. after police stopped two juveniles who were walking in the 900 block of Shaw Street.\n\nAs the boy was fleeing, he displayed what appeared to be a handgun, the chief said. The boy was shot in the chest during a \"ground struggle,\" he said. The boy died at Wynn Hospital in Utica.\n\nSaturday night, family, friends and strangers took to the scene of the crime to talk about Nyah and ask for justice.\n\nThe boy has just this month completed 8th grade at Donovan Middle School in Utica.\n\nSpeakers at the vigil said Nyah and his family immigrated to the United States nine years ago from Burma to seek safety from wars and military and police violence.\n\n\"This country is supposed to be a country of freedom, a country of peace,\" Yadana Oo said to the group of supporters. \"What's going on? Did we run from one persecutor to another?\"\n\nMembers of the community showed their support by lighting candles and bringing flowers and balloons.\n\nThe streets echoed with protest chants of \"No justice, no peace,\" \"Say his name,\" \"Lock 'em up,\" and more.\n\nFriends, family and religious leaders took turns speaking in both English and Karen to express their support and discontent with the investigation.\n\n\"He says that he won't be satisfied until the murderers are put in jail,\" Nyah's brother, Lah said through an interpreter.\n\nKay Klo, who was one of the leaders at the vigil, shared the brother's confusion.\n\n\"We are here today because the stories don't add up,\" Klo said. \"The story they told the family at a press conference, what the witnesses say they saw in the video. None of it adds up. The police officers need to be investigated and held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nAt a news conference on Saturday morning, Utica Mayor Michael P. Galime said the Attorney General's office would be opening and investigation into the shooting. That probe began on Saturday.\n\n\"Now my question is, how are we supposed to trust the police?\" Oo said. \"They said they're here to serve and they said they're here to serve and protect, but how can we trust them?\"\n\nKaren community leaders plan to meet Sunday to discuss what the next steps are to seek justice for Nyah.\n\n\"There will be more information coming around, actions that will be taken, but please know that we are going to need your support long after today,\" Hilda Jordan told the crowd. \"The ramifications, the consequences, the pain. We feel it today, but we'll feel it so much more as the days come. Our heart is with you as a community.

What we know.", "body": "The screams of a grieving mother could be heard through Utica City Hall at a press conference Saturday morning, detailing the shooting death of a 13-year-old member of the Karen community by an officer on Friday night.\n\nWhat started as rumblings turned into screams from all sides as Utica Mayor Michael Galime, through the help of an interpreter, spoke to the mother and family of the 13-year-old boy.\n\nSaturday's press conference was originally meant for members of the press, but was opened up to the general public due to the sheer number of people, according to the mayor.\n\n\"We called this press conference not to just explain and be completely transparent, but to offer our condolences to the family and the community for their loss,\" Galime said. \"Yesterday evening, while a stop like the one that occurred is routine, it became tragic in near moments. We understand and we're here to be completely transparent and explain everything about the incident to the community and the process moving forward.\"\n\nTimeline of events\n\nTurning the press conference over to the police chief, Williams attempted to provide a timeline of events.\n\nAccording to Police Chief Mark Williams, Utica police officers were conducting a pedestrian stop of two juveniles around 10:18 p.m. on Friday, June 28 in the 900 block of Shaw Street.\n\nOne of the juveniles, a male, fled from police. Williams said that during the chase, the juvenile displayed \"...what appeared to be a handgun.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, the moment these words were uttered by the police chief, those in attendance -- more than 100 packed into City Hall -- started screaming. Anger rose from the crowd with shouts of \"No!\" and attempts by some to calm the crowd down.\n\nContinuing, Williams said the officer discharged his firearm once and struck the teen \"...during a ground struggle.\" The 13-year-old was taken to Wynn Hospital where he died from his wounds.\n\n\"Officers then recovered a replica GLOCK 17 handgun with a detachable magazine, but it was ultimately determined to be a pellet gun,\" Williams said. \"We will be releasing the names of the officers involved in the very near future. We ask for patience as this investigation continues.\"\n\nYells of indignation were heard by members of the crowd after learning that the three officers involved in the incident were placed on paid administrative leave during the course of the investigation, with one crowd member commenting how they're getting \"...a paid vacation.\"\n\nGalime said to the crowd that he was dedicated to being as transparent as possible and that directly after the press conference, they were asking the family and representatives of the community to speak with them.\n\nFamily present\n\nAfter this was translated, the mother of the 13-year-old began yelling and screaming in her native language. A member of the community translated, saying \"...She said she doesn't want to be in the same room as killers.\"\n\nThe mother's wails could be heard for a moment before the whole crowd drowned out representatives.\n\nWalking towards the crowd, Galime stood before the mother and spoke with her for a brief time as the whole crowd yelled for justice.\n\nThe public press conference was closed early and taken to a private room upstairs in city hall, where officials answered questions about the next step.\n\nState attorney investigation\n\nIn officer-involved shootings, New York State Executive Law 70b mandates that the New York State Attorney General Office of Special Investigations has the lead criminal investigatory role.\n\nThe Utica Police Department is conducting a joint parallel internal investigation with its Professional Standards Unit to determine if policies, procedures, and training were followed.\n\nAdditionally, UPD will work closely and openly with the City of Utica Public Safety Advisory Committee.\n\nOver the next several days, police will publicly release multiple media formats. Police also plan to release a Critical Incident Brief, a comprehensive overview of the events.\n\nAdditionally, UPD will release the full Body Worn Camera content of the involved officers.\n\nFurther questions\n\nAfter the public press conference, the mayor, police chief, and Public Information Officer Lt. Michael Curley held a private press conference for the media.\n\n\"Our Police Department deals with investigations day in and day out and they don't end like this,\" Galime said. \"They do not end like this. This situation unfolded due to the events very specific to this situation. And that is why we have to only speak to what we can release and when it's released... And we're not going to offer information we're not absolutely sure of.\"\n\nAs it stands, Williams said that the two juveniles were stopped as part of an ongoing investigation but could not answer as to the subject of that investigation until it was concluded.\n\nWhen asked about lethal force used, Williams explained that at the time, there was no way to know that the gun in question was a pellet gun until the officers got their hands on it.\n\n\"You don't bring a TASR to a gunfight. When you, at the time, perceive deadly physical force, you have to match it,\" Williams said. \"This will be investigated through the attorney general's office and it will be viewed through the landmark case of Graham v. Connor.\"\n\nSocial media video\n\nThe police department said it is aware of a video of the incident circulating on social media platforms.\n\nAuthorities said it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\nUtica police ask that the public obtains all of the information that will be made available when reviewing this incident.\n\nMoving forward\n\nGalime said updates will be released as they become available. T\n\nime frames for investigations like this can be long, according to Williams, and there might likely be several months before conclusions are heard from the attorney general's office.\n\nUntil then, Galime made it clear where the city stands.\n\n\"This office and our police department, will operate with utmost efficiency and transparency,\" Galime said. \"Following the closure of the press conference, myself and the translator had a conversation with the mother and her surrounding friends and family. She is not just distraught, she is grieving in the way that was [shown] downstairs. And it's not only acceptable, it's expected.\"\n\n\"What we need to do from this side is make sure that... moving forward, we'll continue to be as objective as possible and every single incident that involves an investigation is met with objectivity and the letter of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.timestelegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Telegram"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica_City_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utica City FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Laws_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consolidated Laws of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellet_(air_gun)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pellet (air gun)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._Connor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graham v.

Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's.\"\n\nA bystander video posted to Facebook shows one of the officers chasing after Nyah Mway and tackling him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching the teen as two other officers arrive. A gunshot rings out as the teen is on the ground and the officers quickly stand up.\n\nWilliams cautioned that the bystander video does not portray the event in its entirety.\n\nThe officers involved in the shooting, whose names were not immediately released, were placed on administrative leave with pay.\n\nThe shooting has roiled Utica, a city some 240 miles (400 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan that is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a nonprofit that helps to resettle the refugees.\n\nNyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, has been identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority.\n\nKarens are an ethnic minority that are among the groups warring with the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma. The army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and suppressed widespread nonviolent protests that sought a return to democratic rule.\n\nDuring a tense news conference Saturday, Williams would not say what prompted police to stop the two youths or what the investigation concerned. The news conference ended early as Williams, the city's mayor and an interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nWilliams pledged to release unedited video of the officers' body-worn cameras but had not done so as of Saturday evening.\n\nThe police department is conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed policies and training. The state attorney general, which did not respond to a request for comment Saturday, will open its own case to determine if the shooting was justified.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" Williams said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Utica Police Department and the community they serve continue to grapple with the tragic incident that happened Friday night on the 900 block of Shaw Street.\n\nTo recap, Utica Police released details Saturday morning surrounding the shooting death of a 13-year-old male in the city. An initial investigation has revealed that officers with the Crime Prevention Unit stopped two male juveniles in the area of Shaw Street. When police stopped them, one male fled on foot and a struggle ensued. During that struggle, police say the 13-year-old appeared to display a handgun and as a result an officer discharged what would be a fatal shot. The 13-year-old was transported to Wynn Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.\n\nDuring a very difficult and tumultuous press conference at City Hall Saturday morning UPD Chief Mark Williams assured the public that his agency would engage in full transparency with regard to what they can share during this investigation. That is why the Utica Police Department has released body worn camera footage Saturday night. The facebook post above gives more details and provides access the link to a google drive which shows all angles from all officers. There are also photos of the replica BB pistol found at the scene.\n\nThe subsequent investigation determined that the male was in possession of \"a replica GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine,\" according to police. This is a tragic story that will have a severe impact on this community for months and even years to come. The important thing to remember is the Attorney General's office will surely conduct a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of the incident and determine independently if charges should be brought against the officer.\n\nUtica Police officials have emphasized the point that they will continue to engage in full cooperation and transparency when it comes to dealing with this tragic shooting.

The confrontation occurred around 10:18 PM on the 900 block of Shaw Street, during which police were conducting a stop related to an ongoing investigation involving two juveniles.\n\nAccording to the Utica Police Department, the situation escalated when one of the juveniles, later identified as Nyah Mway, attempted to flee on foot and displayed what appeared to be a handgun. During a subsequent ground struggle with officers, the perceived threat led one officer to discharge their firearm, striking Mway in the chest. He was transported to Wynn Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.\n\nLt. Michael Curley, a spokesperson for the police department, stated that the weapon in question was a replica gun, which closely resembled a real firearm complete with Glock markings, a detachable magazine, and serial numbers. However, it was ultimately determined to be capable of firing only pellets or BBs.\n\nThe incident has deeply affected both the community and the police force. \"Our thoughts are with our officers involved, and the family of the deceased juvenile,\" Lt. Curley expressed.\n\nThis incident raises important questions about the use of force and the challenges officers face in rapidly assessing threats.

Protests erupt at city hall", "body": "UTICA, N.Y. - The screams of a grieving mother could be heard through a city hall at a press conference in upstate New York Saturday morning, as officials detailed the shooting death of a 13-year-old member of the Karen community by an officer on Friday night.\n\nWhat started as rumblings turned into screams from all sides as Utica Mayor Michael Galime, through the help of an interpreter, spoke to the mother and family of Nyah Mway, 13, who is from the Karen community, with roots in Myanmar and Southeast Asia.\n\nSaturday's press conference was originally meant for reporters but was opened to the general public due to the sheer number of people, according to the mayor.\n\n\"We called this press conference not to just explain and be completely transparent, but to offer our condolences to the family and the community for their loss,\" Galime said. \"Yesterday evening, while a stop like the one that occurred is routine, it became tragic in near moments. We understand and we're here to be completely transparent and explain everything about the incident to the community and the process moving forward.\"\n\nTimeline of events\n\nPolice Chief Mark Williams then attempted to provide a timeline of events.\n\nWilliams said Utica police officers were conducting a pedestrian stop of two juveniles around 10:18 p.m. on Friday on a tree-lined residential street.\n\nOne of the juveniles, a young man, fled from police. Williams said that during the chase that ensued, the young man displayed \"what appeared to be a handgun.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, the moment these words were uttered by the police chief, some of the people in attendance - more than 100 packed into city hall - started screaming. Anger rose from the crowd with shouts of \"No!\" and attempts by some to calm the crowd down.\n\nPride 2024: 'Youth are our future'? Think again. LGBTQ+ youth activism is already making an impact.\n\nContinuing, Williams said the officer discharged his firearm once and struck the teen \"during a ground struggle.\" The 13-year-old was taken to Wynn Hospital where he died from his wounds.\n\n\"Officers then recovered a replica GLOCK 17 handgun with a detachable magazine, but it was ultimately determined to be a pellet gun,\" Williams said. \"We will be releasing the names of the officers involved in the very near future. We ask for patience as this investigation continues.\"\n\nYells of indignation came from the crowd after they learned the three officers involved in the incident had been placed on paid administrative during the investigation. One person commented aloud that the police were getting \"...a paid vacation.\"\n\nGalime told the crowd he was dedicated to being as transparent as possible and that directly after the press conference, he would invite the family and representatives of the community to speak with city officials.\n\nFamily present\n\nAfter this was translated, the mother of the 13-year-old began yelling and screaming. A member of the community translated, saying \"She said she doesn't want to be in the same room as killers.\"\n\nThe mother's wails could be heard for a moment before the whole crowd drowned out the government officials.\n\nWalking towards the crowd, Galime stood before the mother and spoke with her for a brief time as the whole crowd yelled for justice.\n\nThe public press conference was closed early and relocated to a private room upstairs in city hall, where officials answered questions about the next steps.\n\nState attorney investigation\n\nIn officer-involved shootings, New York State Executive Law 70b mandates that the New York State Attorney General Office of Special Investigations take the lead criminal investigatory role.\n\nThe Utica Police Department is conducting a joint parallel internal investigation with its Professional Standards Unit to determine whether staff followed policies, procedures and training guidelines.\n\nOver the next several days, police said they would publicly release more details about the incident and a comprehensive overview of the events. Police also plan to release the full body cam footage from the officers involved.\n\nFurther questions\n\nAfter the public press conference, the mayor, police chief and department spokesperson Lt. Michael Curley held a private press conference for the media.\n\n\"Our police department deals with investigations day in and day out and they don't end like this,\" Galime said. \"They do not end like this. This situation unfolded due to the events very specific to this situation. And that is why we have to only speak to what we can release and when it's released... And we're not going to offer information we're not absolutely sure of.\"\n\nUvalde: Ex-Uvalde school police chief Arredondo didn't stop gunman 'hunting and shooting' students\n\nAs it stands, Williams said the two juveniles were stopped as part of an ongoing investigation but declined to answer questions about the subject of the investigation until it was concluded.\n\nWhen asked about lethal force being used, Williams explained that at the time, there was no way to know that the gun in question was a pellet gun until the officers got their hands on it.\n\n\"You don't bring a TASR to a gunfight. When you, at the time, perceive deadly physical force, you have to match it,\" Williams said.\n\nSocial media video\n\nThe police department said it is aware of a video of the incident that is circulating on social media platforms.\n\nAuthorities said the video does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\nGalime said updates will be released as they become available. Investigations like this can take a long time, according to Williams, and there might likely be several months before the attorney general's office has conclusions.\n\nUntil then, Galime made it clear where the city stands.\n\n\"This office and our police department will operate with utmost efficiency and transparency,\" Galime said. \"Following the closure of the press conference, myself and the translator had a conversation with the mother and her surrounding friends and family. She is not just distraught, she is grieving in the way that was [shown] downstairs.

The Utica Police Department extends heartfelt condolences to Mway's family and promises continued transparency throughout the investigation.\n\nThe three officers involved in the incident, all members of the Crime Prevention Unit, have been identified. Officer Patrick Husnay, a six-year veteran of the Utica Police Department, fired the duty weapon that struck Mway. He was accompanied by Officer Bryce Patterson, a four-year veteran, and Officer Andrew Citriniti, a two-and-a-half-year veteran who previously served with the Oneida County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOn June 28, the officers were patrolling West Utica near Shaw Street to assist the Criminal Investigations Division with recent robbery investigations. The suspects in these robberies were described as Asian males, one dark-skinned male, with one incident involving a black firearm. Nyah Mway and another juvenile matched these descriptions and were found in the vicinity of a recent robbery. Mway was also walking in the roadway, violating New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law 1156a. Following CID's directives, the officers attempted to stop and identify the two juveniles.\n\nBody worn camera (BWC) footage reveals that when officers approached Mway, he fled on foot, producing a replica GLOCK pellet gun. The footage shows Mway pointing the weapon at Officer Patterson and the other officers at the 51 and 53-second marks.\n\nThe NYS Attorney General's Office of Special Investigations will determine if the shooting violated any state laws. The Utica Police Department aims to maintain transparency by sharing all available evidence, including BWC footage, through a publicly accessible Google Drive link. This folder includes the handgun used and other relevant files.\n\nThere are two ongoing investigations: one by the NYS Attorney General and the other an internal investigation by the Utica Police Department's Professional Standards unit.

The state's Attorney General's Office has started its own, as required by state law.\n\nRelated Syracuse.com articles\n\nBoy shot and killed by Utica police officer identified, vigil tonight\n\nBoy shot dead by officer in Utica during struggle had pellet gun, chief says\n\n13-year-old boy dies after being shot by Utica police officer during struggle", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellet_(air_gun)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pellet (air gun)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Post-Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Post-Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/4TBQM7FRLJGXNN5PQ725QTLLUA.jpg?auth=4cfc3bfc4b13aa82e581fcf1a71fe5d1ac8e6748c05c2d1640f9b61605e70160&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Members of the community, including the youth's family, were in attendance.\n\nOne of the officers fired a single shot at the teen \"during a ground struggle,\" striking him in the chest, Williams said.\n\nThe teen, who he described as a 13-year-old Asian male, was given \"immediate\" first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died from his injuries, the police chief said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Officers, he said, recovered a replica GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine from the scene.\n\n\"It is in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\" Lt. Michael Curley said in an email to The Associated Press later, when asked to elaborate about the weapon. \"However ultimately it fires only pellets or BB's. \"\n\nWilliams said the department would release the identities of the officer and the youth later in addition to photos of the weapon. Over the next several days, he said, the department will be releasing a report providing a \"comprehensive overview of the events\" as well as the full body camera footage from the officers who were involved.\n\nAudience members shouted down officials' remarks at times, while at moments people implored the rest of the crowd to quiet down so members of the Myanmar community could hear the responses translated by an interpreter in Karen.\n\nMayor Michael Galime stressed the city would be transparent in its investigation, adding that he and other officials would be meeting privately with the youth's family and other community members to answer their questions.\n\n\"We are holding this press conference so you can all be in this room,\" he said. \"We understand the weight of this situation and we want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood. Everything will be released and everyone in this room and the entire community will have access to all of that information.\"\n\nWilliams said the Office of the New York State Attorney General will lead the investigation into the shooting and will determine if it was justified.\n\nSpokespersons for state Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.\n\nIn the meantime, the officers involved will be placed on administrative leave with pay until further notice, in keeping with protocol during such shootings, Williams said.\n\nThe department will also be conducting its own internal investigation to see whether officers followed department policies and training, he said.\n\nWilliams said the department is also aware of a video circulating on social media of the incident but warned that it does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\n\"I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased party during this difficult time,\" he said. \"This is a tragic and traumatic incident for all involved.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Protests erupt at City Hall.", "body": "UTICA, N.Y. - The screams of a grieving mother could be heard through a city hall at a press conference in Upstate New York Saturday morning, as officials detailed the shooting death of a 13-year-old member of the Karen community by an officer on Friday night.\n\nWhat started as rumblings turned into screams from all sides as Utica Mayor Michael Galime, through the help of an interpreter, spoke to the mother and family of Nyah Mway, 13, who is from the Karen community, with roots in Myanmar and Southeast Asia.\n\nSaturday's press conference was originally meant for reporters but was opened to the general public due to the sheer number of people, according to the mayor.\n\n\"We called this press conference not to just explain and be completely transparent, but to offer our condolences to the family and the community for their loss,\" Galime said. \"Yesterday evening, while a stop like the one that occurred is routine, it became tragic in near moments. We understand and we're here to be completely transparent and explain everything about the incident to the community and the process moving forward.\"\n\nPolice Chief Mark Williams then attempted to provide a timeline of events.\n\nWilliams said Utica police officers were conducting a pedestrian stop of two juveniles around 10:18 p.m. on Friday on a tree-lined residential street.\n\nOne of the juveniles, a young man, fled from police. Williams said that during the chase that ensued, the young man displayed \"what appeared to be a handgun.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, the moment these words were uttered by the police chief, some of the people in attendance - more than 100 packed into City Hall - started screaming. Anger rose from the crowd with shouts of \"No!\" and attempts by some to calm the crowd down.\n\nPride 2024: 'Youth are our future'? Think again. LGBTQ+ youth activism is already making an impact.\n\nContinuing, Williams said the officer discharged his firearm once and struck the teen \"during a ground struggle.\" The 13-year-old was taken to Wynn Hospital where he died from his wounds.\n\n\"Officers then recovered a replica GLOCK 17 handgun with a detachable magazine, but it was ultimately determined to be a pellet gun,\" Williams said. \"We will be releasing the names of the officers involved in the very near future. We ask for patience as this investigation continues.\"\n\nYells of indignation came from the crowd after they learned the three officers involved in the incident had been placed on paid administrative during the investigation. One person commented aloud that the police were getting \"...a paid vacation.\"\n\nGalime told the crowd he was dedicated to being as transparent as possible and that directly after the press conference, he would invite the family and representatives of the community to speak with city officials.\n\nAfter this was translated, the mother of the 13-year-old began yelling and screaming in her native language. A member of the community translated, saying \"She said she doesn't want to be in the same room as killers.\"\n\nThe mother's wails could be heard for a moment before the whole crowd drowned out the government officials.\n\nWalking towards the crowd, Galime stood before the mother and spoke with her for a brief time as the whole crowd yelled for justice.\n\nThe public press conference was closed early and relocated to a private room upstairs in city hall, where officials answered questions about the next steps.\n\nIn officer-involved shootings, New York State Executive Law 70b mandates that the New York State Attorney General Office of Special Investigations take the lead criminal investigatory role.\n\nThe Utica Police Department is conducting a joint parallel internal investigation with its Professional Standards Unit to determine whether staff followed policies, procedures and training guidelines.\n\nOver the next several days, police said they would publicly release more details about the incident and a comprehensive overview of the events. Police also plan to release the full body cam footage from the officers involved.\n\nAfter the public press conference, the mayor, police chief and department spokesperson Lt. Michael Curley held a private press conference for the media.\n\n\"Our police department deals with investigations day in and day out and they don't end like this,\" Galime said. \"They do not end like this. This situation unfolded due to the events very specific to this situation. And that is why we have to only speak to what we can release and when it's released... And we're not going to offer information we're not absolutely sure of.\"\n\nUvalde: Ex-Uvalde school police chief Arredondo didn't stop gunman 'hunting and shooting' students\n\nAs it stands, Williams said the two juveniles were stopped as part of an ongoing investigation but declined to answer questions about the subject of the investigation until it was concluded.\n\nWhen asked about lethal force being used, Williams explained that at the time, there was no way to know that the gun in question was a pellet gun until the officers got their hands on it.\n\n\"You don't bring a TASR to a gunfight. When you, at the time, perceive deadly physical force, you have to match it,\" Williams said.\n\nThe police department said it is aware of a video of the incident that is circulating on social media platforms.\n\nAuthorities said the video does not portray the incident in its entirety.\n\nGalime said updates will be released as they become available. Investigations like this can take a long time, according to Williams, and there might likely be several months before the attorney general's office has conclusions.\n\nUntil then, Galime made it clear where the city stands.\n\n\"This office and our police department will operate with utmost efficiency and transparency,\" Galime said. \"Following the closure of the press conference, myself and the translator had a conversation with the mother and her surrounding friends and family. She is not just distraught, she is grieving in the way that was [shown] downstairs. And it's not only acceptable, it's expected.\"\n\n\"What we need to do from this side is make sure that... moving forward, we'll continue to be as objective as possible and every single incident that involves an investigation is met with objectivity and the letter of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellet_(air_gun)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pellet (air gun)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magazine (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Laws_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consolidated Laws of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QpWXpbcnZNgVYVeYOVvgKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05Mjc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/f586a409fe678eadd88d9e9db2b8910d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693284", "eventUri": "eng-9693284", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The bodycam video of the shocking incident has now been released. Nyah Mway, a Burmese refugee, was one of the two juveniles stopped by the Utica Police Department's crime prevention unit at 10.18 pm Friday. As they were stopped, the 13-year-old ran and displayed a pellet gun, the police said.Then he was fatally shot by the police.\n\n\"Can I just pat you down to make sure you've got no weapons on you?\" officer Bryce Patterson asked Mway, as seen in the bodycam footage. Mway spoke to him in English and raised his hands before quickly running off making three police officers chase him. Then Mway pulled out what appeared to be a pellet gun and pointed it directly at the officers.\n\nPatterson tackled Mway to the ground and another officer fired a single shot. Mway was later taken to the hospital where he died. The New York State Attorney General's office is investigating whether the shooting was justified.\n\nAfter the shooting, the weapon Mway flashed was determined to be a replica Glock and a pellet gun.\n\nThe police said they were looking for teens, suspects in recent armed robberies who were described as \"Asian males who brandished a black in color firearm and forcibly demanded and stole property from victims\". In one of the robberies, one of the suspects was walking while the other was on a bicycle like Mway and his friend as seen by the cops.\n\nAll the three officers have been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe killing triggered an intense standoff between the police officers and the 100 community members at the police station. Some reports claimed Nyah who just completed his 8th grade was walking home from Bible study when cops killed him.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Richard Pombo's seat, former Rep. Pete McCloskey, is shown at his law office in Redwood City, Calif., March 16, 2006. Former California Congressman McCloskey, who ran as a Republican challenging President Richard Nixon in 1972, has died Wednesday, May 8, 2024, at age 96. McCloskey was a pro-environment, anti-war lawmaker who co-authored the federal Endangered Species Act and co-founded Earth Day.\n\nFRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Pete McCloskey -- a pro-environment, anti-war California Republican who co-wrote the Endangered Species Act and co-founded Earth Day -- has died. He was 96.\n\nA fourth-generation Republican \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" he often said, McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against an incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a------ they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W. Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\n\"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics -- his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" Houskeeper said. \"He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\"\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pombo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood_City,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redwood City, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redwood City, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_McNerney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry McNerney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ehrlichman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a -- -- they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W. Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\n\"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics -- his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" Joe Cotchett, his law partner since 2004, said in a statement. \"He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\"\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nMcCloskey joined the Marine Corps as an officer and led a rifle platoon during some of the most intense fighting of the Korean War. He was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism, the nation's second-highest honor, a Silver Star for bravery in combat and two Purple Hearts.\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\n\"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one,\" said Denis Hayes, co-organizer of the Earth Day, about the rarity of a \"green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\n____\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pombo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_McNerney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry McNerney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ehrlichman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a -- -- they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W.

He was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism, the nation's second-highest honor, a Silver Star for bravery in combat and two Purple Hearts.\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\n\"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one,\" said Denis Hayes, co-organizer of the Earth Day, about the rarity of a \"green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\n____\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.", "source": {"uri": "cbs17.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS17.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@cbs17.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pombo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_McNerney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry McNerney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_peddling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influence peddling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ehrlichman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

He was 96.\n\nA fourth-generation Republican \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" he often said, McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against an incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a -- -- -- they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W. Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\n\"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics - his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" Houskeeper said. \"He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\"\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it.

Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\n\"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics -- his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" Joe Cotchett, his law partner since 2004, said in a statement. \"He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\"\n\nMcCloskey's Early Life and Military Service\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nMcCloskey joined the Marine Corps as an officer and led a rifle platoon during some of the most intense fighting of the Korean War. He was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism, the nation's second-highest honor, a Silver Star for bravery in combat and two Purple Hearts.\n\nRelated Story: Country Star Toby Keith Died Before Being Told He Was Elected to Hall of Fame\n\nMcCloskey's Political Career and Legacy\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\n\"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one,\" said Denis Hayes, co-organizer of the Earth Day, about the rarity of a \"green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pombo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_McNerney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry McNerney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ehrlichman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

He was 96.\n\nA fourth-generation Republican \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" he often said, McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against an incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a------ they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W. Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\n\"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics -- his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" Houskeeper said. \"He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\"\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\n____\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pombo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_McNerney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry McNerney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ehrlichman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

(AP) -- Pete McCloskey -- a pro-environment, anti-war California Republican who co-wrote the Endangered Species Act and co-founded Earth Day -- has died. He was 96.\n\nA fourth-generation Republican \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" he often said, McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against an incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a------ they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W. Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\n\"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics -- his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" Houskeeper said. \"He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\"\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Mica Miller's final hours: NC sheriff releases findings of Myrtle Beach woman's death Timeline: What happened on the day Mica Miller died?

UPDATE: Lawyer for Aiken Mayor Milner releases statement on allegation of elder abuse Second person arrested in connection to fatal hit-and-run on Morrison Drive granted bond Planes divert to Charleston after military jet incident at Savannah airport\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\n\"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one,\" said Denis Hayes, co-organizer of the Earth Day, about the rarity of a \"green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pombo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_McNerney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry McNerney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Ehrlichman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_peddling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influence peddling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

(AP) - Pete McCloskey - a pro-environment, anti-war California Republican who co-wrote the Endangered Species Act and co-founded Earth Day - has died. He was 96.\n\nA fourth-generation Republican \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" he often said, McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against an incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nHe died at home Wednesday, according to Lee Houskeeper, a family friend.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California\u00b4s 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\n\"It was foolish to run against him (Pombo), but we didn't have anybody else to do it, and I could not stand what a------ they'd become,\" the frank-talking former Marine colonel said of the modern GOP in a 2008 interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment from influence peddling and ethics scandals under the George W. Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79.\n\nFILE - Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, left, admires the bumper sticker on the car of Congressman Pete McCloskey as the congressman looks on, right, in San Jose, Calif., Sept. 25, 1980.

Former California Congressman McCloskey, who ran as a Republican challenging President Richard Nixon in 1972, has died at age 96. (AP Photo/Harrity, File)\n\n\"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen - his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 - and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\n____\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.\n\nFILE - Former Republican U.S. Rep.

(John Green/Bay Area News Group/TNS)\n\nPaul N. \"Pete\" McCloskey, a decorated Korean War combat marine who beat celebrity Shirley Temple to win a seat in Congress representing California in the late 1960s, then became the first Republican in the House to call for Richard Nixon's resignation and a co-chair of the first Earth Day, died Wednesday. He was 96.\n\nMcCloskey, a colorful, contrarian figure for generations, died at his house in Winters, in rural Yolo County, of congestive heart failure.\n\nThroughout his life, McCloskey was known as someone who put principle over politics, even when it ruffled feathers. A square-jawed iconoclast, he was a prominent member of what today is nearly an extinct breed in Congress -- a liberal Republican.\n\nMcCloskey also was a champion of environmental issues, who saw his work as a continuum of the conservation efforts of former President Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nHe was co-chairman of the first Earth Day in 1970 with Sen. Gaylord Nelson, a Wisconsin Democrat, a strong supporter of passing the Endangered Species Act in 1973, and in later life an advocate for opening Martins Beach in San Mateo County to the public after it was closed by billionaire Vinod Khosla in 2008.\n\n\"He stood for everyone without a voice, and was especially passionate about our environment -- he was afraid of nothing or anyone who sought to take advantage of another,\" said Joe Cotchett, his law partner since 2004. \"He was the epitome of a leader, as demonstrated throughout his entire life.\"\n\nMcCloskey was born on September 29, 1927, in Loma Linda, California, the son of Mary Vera (McNabb) and Paul Norton McCloskey.\n\nHis great-grandfather, orphaned during the Irish potato famine, came to San Francisco in 1853. One grandfather was a U.S. attorney and captain of the National Guard unit that helped control rioting in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. His maternal grandfather was mayor of San Bernardino in the early 1900s.\n\nAfter graduating as valedictorian from South Pasadena High School in 1945, McCloskey attended Occidental College and California Institute of Technology. He served in the Navy from 1945 to 1947, then graduated from Stanford University in 1950 and Stanford University Law School in 1953.\n\nHis time at Stanford was interrupted by the Korean War. A Marine Corps rifle platoon commander, he saw some of the most difficult combat of the war, earning the Navy Cross and the Silver Star, along with two Purple Hearts. During his 10 months in North Korea, 58 of the 61 members of his platoon were either killed or wounded.\n\nIn 2011, he gave one of the Purple Heart medals to former Rep. Jackie Speier (D-San Mateo), saying that she had not been publicly recognized after being shot five times in Guyana in 1978 when she visited Jim Jones cult as a 28-year-old congressional staff member with her boss, Rep. Leo Ryan. She lay on the tarmac at an airfield for 22 hours waiting for help.\n\n\"She earned it,\" McCloskey told the Los Angeles Times at the time. \"She got hurt worse than I did.\"\n\nAfter the Korean War, McCloskey worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, and went into private practice as a lawyer near Stanford in 1956. He worked on civil rights and environmental cases.\n\nHe served as President of the Palo Alto Bar Association, and taught legal ethics and political science as a guest professor at Stanford University and Santa Clara Law School.\n\nIn 1967, he took on what seemed like an impossible political task.\n\nHe ran for Congress to succeed Rep. Arthur Younger, a World War I veteran who had died in office of leukemia. But he had another, much more well-known opponent in the Republican primary -- former child superstar Shirley Temple Black, who most political observers expected to win easily.\n\nBut Black ran a lackluster campaign, including holding rallies that featured the song \"The Good Ship Lollipop,\" which she had made famous in films in the 1930s as a dancing child star.\n\n\"Everyone thought that Shirley Temple would win in a walk,\" McCloskey told Mercury News in 1986. \"She could have if she had not exposed herself to be so ignorant of the issues.\"\n\nBut, McCloskey added, Temple Black later became \"an enlightened public servant\" in United Nations and various diplomatic posts.\n\nFor eight terms, McCloskey repeatedly enraged the conservative wing of his Republican party before retiring from the House of Representatives in 1982 to run unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate. He lost the Senate race in the Republican primary to San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, who eventually defeated Jerry Brown.\n\nAlmost from the moment he took his seat in the House, McCloskey began calling for the United States to withdraw from the Vietnam War and seek a gradual unification of its North and South.\n\nHe announced a quixotic campaign in 1971 for president against Nixon.\n\n\"To talk, as the president does, of winding down the war while he is expanding the use of air power is a deliberate deception,\" McCloskey said. \"I'll probably get licked, but I can't keep quiet.\"\n\nAfter Nixon won re-election and became embroiled in the Watergate scandal, McCloskey called for him to resign. Then-Vice President Spiro Agnew called McCloskey \"a Benedict Arnold.\"\n\nDuring his time in Congress, McCloskey championed civil rights. He became a leading voice in environmental causes, co-sponsoring the Endangered Species Act, which Nixon signed into law in 1973.\n\nAn avid backpacker and fly fisherman, he served six years as congressional delegate to the International Whaling Conference and as congressional advisor to the Law of the Sea Treaty Delegation.\n\n\"With a twinkle in his eye but a titanium backbone, Pete McCloskey spent his whole life campaigning for peace, justice, and a livable future,\" said Denis Hayes, who organized the first Earth Day. \"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one: the last remaining progressive, green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nMcCloskey helped end conservative Reverend Pat Robertson's presidential run in 1988, revealing that the televangelist was not a \"combat veteran\" as he had claimed. McCloskey documented how Robertson's father, U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson of Virginia, had used his political influence to get his son out of combat duty by having him sent to Japan for safety during the war. Robertson sued McCloskey, but lost the case.\n\nIn 2006, McCloskey re-entered politics, running against seven-term Republican Rep. Richard Pombo of Tracy. He lost, then endorsed Pombo's Democratic opponent, Jerry McNerney, who won the general election, and the following year, outraged over mistreatment of prisoners in the Iraq War during the Bush administration, McCloskey became a Democrat.\n\nMcCloskey and Caroline Wadsworth married in 1949 and had four children.

He was 96.\n\nMcCloskey, a colorful, contrarian figure for generations, died at his house in Winters, in rural Yolo County, of congestive heart failure.\n\nThroughout his life, McCloskey was known as someone who put principle over politics, even when it ruffled feathers. A square-jawed iconoclast, he was a prominent member of what today is nearly an extinct breed in Congress -- a liberal Republican.\n\nMcCloskey also was a champion of environmental issues, who saw his work as a continuum of the conservation efforts of former President Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nHe was co-chairman of the first Earth Day in 1970 with Sen. Gaylord Nelson, a Wisconsin Democrat, a strong supporter of passing the Endangered Species Act in 1973, and in later life an advocate for opening Martins Beach in San Mateo County to the public after it was closed by billionaire Vinod Khosla in 2008.\n\n\"He stood for everyone without a voice, and was especially passionate about our environment -- he was afraid of nothing or anyone who sought to take advantage of another,\" said Joe Cotchett, his law partner since 2004. \"He was the epitome of a leader, as demonstrated throughout his entire life.\"\n\nMcCloskey was born on September 29, 1927, in Loma Linda, California, the son of Mary Vera (McNabb) and Paul Norton McCloskey.\n\nHis great-grandfather, orphaned during the Irish potato famine, came to San Francisco in 1853. One grandfather was a U.S. attorney and captain of the National Guard unit that helped control rioting in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. His maternal grandfather was mayor of San Bernardino in the early 1900s.\n\nAfter graduating as valedictorian from South Pasadena High School in 1945, McCloskey attended Occidental College and California Institute of Technology. He served in the Navy from 1945 to 1947, then graduated from Stanford University in 1950 and Stanford University Law School in 1953.\n\nHis time at Stanford was interrupted by the Korean War. A Marine Corps rifle platoon commander, he saw some of the most difficult combat of the war, earning the Navy Cross and the Silver Star, along with two Purple Hearts. During his 10 months in North Korea, 58 of the 61 members of his platoon were either killed or wounded.\n\nIn 2011, he gave one of the Purple Heart medals to former Rep. Jackie Speier (D-San Mateo), saying that she had not been publicly recognized after being shot five times in Guyana in 1978 when she visited Jim Jones cult as a 28-year-old congressional staff member with her boss, Rep. Leo Ryan. She lay on the tarmac at an airfield for 22 hours waiting for help.\n\n\"She earned it,\" McCloskey told the Los Angeles Times at the time. \"She got hurt worse than I did.\"\n\nAfter the Korean War, McCloskey worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, and went into private practice as a lawyer near Stanford in 1956. He worked on civil rights and environmental cases.\n\nHe served as President of the Palo Alto Bar Association, and taught legal ethics and political science as a guest professor at Stanford University and Santa Clara Law School.\n\nIn 1967, he took on what seemed like an impossible political task.\n\nHe ran for Congress to succeed Rep. Arthur Younger, a World War I veteran who had died in office of leukemia. But he had another, much more well-known opponent in the Republican primary -- former child superstar Shirley Temple Black, who most political observers expected to win easily.\n\nBut Black ran a lackluster campaign, including holding rallies that featured the song \"The Good Ship Lollipop,\" which she had made famous in films in the 1930s as a dancing child star.\n\n\"Everyone thought that Shirley Temple would win in a walk,\" McCloskey told Mercury News in 1986. \"She could have if she had not exposed herself to be so ignorant of the issues.\"\n\nBut, McCloskey added, Temple Black later became \"an enlightened public servant\" in United Nations and various diplomatic posts.\n\nFor eight terms, McCloskey repeatedly enraged the conservative wing of his Republican party before retiring from the House of Representatives in 1982 to run unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate. He lost the Senate race in the Republican primary to San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, who eventually defeated Jerry Brown.\n\nAlmost from the moment he took his seat in the House, McCloskey began calling for the United States to withdraw from the Vietnam War and seek a gradual unification of its North and South.\n\nHe announced a quixotic campaign in 1971 for president against Nixon.\n\n\"To talk, as the president does, of winding down the war while he is expanding the use of air power is a deliberate deception,\" McCloskey said. \"I'll probably get licked, but I can't keep quiet.\"\n\nAfter Nixon won re-election and became embroiled in the Watergate scandal, McCloskey called for him to resign. Then-Vice President Spiro Agnew called McCloskey \"a Benedict Arnold.\"\n\nDuring his time in Congress, McCloskey championed civil rights. He became a leading voice in environmental causes, co-sponsoring the Endangered Species Act, which Nixon signed into law in 1973.\n\nAn avid backpacker and fly fisherman, he served six years as congressional delegate to the International Whaling Conference and as congressional advisor to the Law of the Sea Treaty Delegation.\n\n\"With a twinkle in his eye but a titanium backbone, Pete McCloskey spent his whole life campaigning for peace, justice, and a livable future,\" said Denis Hayes, who organized the first Earth Day. \"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one: the last remaining progressive, green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nMcCloskey helped end conservative Reverend Pat Robertson's presidential run in 1988, revealing that the televangelist was not a \"combat veteran\" as he had claimed. McCloskey documented how Robertson's father, U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson of Virginia, had used his political influence to get his son out of combat duty by having him sent to Japan for safety during the war. Robertson sued McCloskey, but lost the case.\n\nIn 2006, McCloskey re-entered politics, running against seven-term Republican Rep. Richard Pombo of Tracy. He lost, then endorsed Pombo's Democratic opponent, Jerry McNerney, who won the general election, and the following year, outraged over mistreatment of prisoners in the Iraq War during the Bush administration, McCloskey became a Democrat.\n\nMcCloskey and Caroline Wadsworth married in 1949 and had four children. Following a divorce, he later married Helen Hooper. He is survived by his wife, Helen; his children, Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen McCloskey; and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nRob Caughlan, who campaigned for McCloskey during his first run for Congress, said his friend told him about a recurring nightmare he had later in life in which he looked into the terrified eyes of a group of young soldiers sitting in a ditch just before he gunned them down. The war \"had an effect on his whole life,\" Caughlan said. \"The reason he was such an activist for peace was because of what he experienced in war.\"\n\n(Mercury News reporter Mack Lundstrom contributed to this story.)\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc.

Nixon for the Republican nomination in 1972, his defeat was nothing short of stunning. Only one of the 1,348 delegates at the Miami convention voted for McCloskey, and nobody gave a speech on his behalf.\n\nRunning to protest the war in Vietnam, the California congressman never expected to win, but he had no idea his short-lived campaign would cost him so many friends. Outside a basement meeting room at the Fontainebleau Hotel, someone said he must be the loneliest man in town, and he agreed.\n\n\"It's always lonely at conventions like this,\" McCloskey, haggard and hoarse, told reporters. \"But then Patrick Henry was lonely when he talked about liberty.\"\n\nMcCloskey was no revolutionary but, as a decorated Marine veteran who wanted U.S. troops out of Vietnam and as the first congressman to urge consideration of Nixon's impeachment on the House floor, he led a life of vigorous dissent.\n\nA Stanford-educated attorney and an ardent outdoorsman, Paul Norton \"Pete\" McCloskey Jr. died Wednesday at his home in Winters, Calif., according to family friend Lee Houskeeper. McCloskey was 96.\n\nWith a photogenic square chin and a shock of Kennedy-esque hair, McCloskey represented his San Mateo district in Congress from 1967 to 1983. In that period, he may have become \"the only political figure in America who has managed to offend just about everybody,\" his friend, actor Paul Newman, said in a trailer for a 2009 documentary.\n\nHis outspokenness about Vietnam earned McCloskey an exile, as he later characterized it, to the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. But even in what he first considered a congressional backwater, McCloskey managed to upset many of his fellow Republicans.\n\n\"Well, the Congress then was much more inclined to be made up of 70-, 80- and 90-year-olds who had grown up at a time when development and progress was the keynote of the country,\" he told The Times in 1985. \"Environmentalists in those days were viewed as little old ladies in tennis shoes or nuts or cranks or kooks.\"\n\nIn the relative obscurity of his position, McCloskey thrived. \"I was able to help put together a coalition that quadrupled the money for clean water with this funny little bill called the National Environmental Policy Act,\" he said. \"I'll tell you, if the Congress had known what was in it, that bill wouldn't have passed.\"\n\nHe co-authored the 1973 Endangered Species Act -- \"the one thing I was proudest of, in that miserable town called Washington,\" he said in a 2012 interview with environmentalist Huey Johnson.\n\nMcCloskey was co-chair of the first Earth Day. Its Democratic organizers, reaching across the aisle in 1970, could find no other Republican willing to do it.\n\nBut not every Democrat was enthralled with the blunt-talking McCloskey, particularly after he started airing his views on the Middle East in the early 1980s. McCloskey supported Yasser Arafat, then chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and angered Jewish organizations with his criticism of what he saw as \"the Jewish lobby's\" undue influence over U.S. policies.\n\nIn 1982, McCloskey lost to future governor Pete Wilson in a primary election for the U.S. Senate. He told The Times that his controversial positions on Israel may have contributed to his defeat.\n\nReturning to California, McCloskey practiced law in the San Francisco area before cutting back his hours and moving to a ranch near the tiny Yolo County town of Rumsey.\n\nRaising Arabian horses and growing organic olives and oranges, McCloskey made a quixotic primary run in 2006 against Rep. Richard Pombo, a longtime Republican congressman known for his opposition to environmental regulations. McCloskey lost but was credited by Democrats with weakening Pombo, who was defeated in the general election.\n\nA year later, McCloskey, repelled by a series of influence-peddling scandals and the George W. Bush administration's \"misdeeds and incompetence,\" switched parties. For 59 years he had been a Republican, but in an email to local newspapers, the fledgling Democrat decried \"the stench of Jack Abramoff\" and declared of Republican leaders: \"A pox on them and their values.\"\n\nMcCloskey was born in San Bernardino on Sept. 29, 1927, and raised in South Pasadena. His father and both grandfathers were attorneys.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1945, he served in the Navy until 1947. He earned an undergraduate degree at Stanford in 1950 and signed on with the Marines for combat in Korea. His commendations included the Navy Cross, the Silver Star and, for wounds received while leading a rifle platoon, two Purple Hearts.\n\nAt a Christmas party in 2011, he gave one of them to then-Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democratic lawmaker from Hillsborough. As an aide to Rep. Leo Ryan in 1978, she was shot five times while helping to evacuate defectors fleeing Jonestown, the Guyana commune where some 900 people died in a massacre.\n\n\"She earned it,\" McCloskey told The Times. \"She got hurt worse than I did.\"\n\nMcCloskey's wounds were also emotional. Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, he had recurring dreams of peering into a trench and emptying his weapon into young, terrified enemy troops.\n\nIn 2014, he traveled to North Korea and arranged to meet with a war veteran from the other side -- a retired three-star general who, like McCloskey, had been wounded.\n\n\"I told him how bravely I thought his people had fought, and we embraced,\" McCloskey told The Times. \"We ended up agreeing that we don't want our grandchildren or great-grandchildren to fight, that war is hell, and there's no glory in it.\"\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Newman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau_Miami_Beach", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fontainebleau Miami Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W.

He went on to serve seven terms in the U.S. House until 1982, when he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBefore getting into politics, McCloskey served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War, where he was awarded the Navy Cross and Silver Star.\n\n\"I got wounded twice,\" McCloskey told ABC7 in an interview. \"The ridge lines were so narrow that you couldn't say 'Sergeant, take the hill.' You just had to say 'follow me,' because you could only get one guy on the hill.\"\n\nDespite serving in the Korean War, McCloskey was outspoken in his opposition to the war in Vietnam -- calling it a war that could not be won -- as he tried to unseat Nixon for the Republican nomination in 1972.\n\n\"To talk, as the president does, of winding down the war while he is expanding the use of air power is a deliberate deception,\" McCloskey said during his campaign for the nomination. \"I'll probably get licked, but I can't keep quiet.\"\n\n\"When McCloskey came out against the war in Vietnam, as a Marine war hero, it was a big deal,\" said environmental activist Robert Caughlan, who was also a friend of McCloskey.\n\nNixon ultimately won the nomination and went on to win the presidency in a landslide before resigning two years later during the Watergate scandal. McCloskey was the first member of Congress to call for Nixon's impeachment.\n\nThroughout his congressional career as a Republican, McCloskey's stances on the war, the environment and Israel were controversial, ultimately leading him to switch parties to become a Democrat in 2007. He called \"the new brand of Republicanism\" hostile to progressive causes.\n\nMcCloskey protested the war in Vietnam and later criticized Israel as a lecturer at Stanford. He introduced environmental legislation including the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and was also the co-chairman of the first Earth Day held on April 22, 1970.\n\n\"Well, perhaps the greatest achievement, and we didn't know it at the time, was we held an Earth Day in 1970, and out of that Earth Day a lot of students got involved in saving the environment, or trying to,\" McCloskey said as he reflected on the designation years later.\n\nEarth Day, which is now observed in 192 countries, will celebrate 55 years in 2025.\n\n\"I think that he was a hero for the environment,\" said Caughlan. \"A hero for peace and a hero in war.

He was 96. A fourth-generation Republican who said he was \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against the incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years. He died at home Wednesday, the AP reports. \"McCloskey was a rarity in American politics -- his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology,\" said Joe Cotchett, his longtime law partner.\n\nMcCloskey cited disillusionment over influence peddling and ethics scandals during the George W. Bush administration when he switched parties in 2007. \"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter to supporters. Born in Loma Linda, California, McCloskey graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame. He joined the Marines as an officer and led a rifle platoon during some of the most intense fighting of the Korean War. He was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism, the nation's second-highest honor, and a Silver Star for bravery in combat. He received two Purple Hearts. He earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm before making the move to public office.\n\nIn 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for Congress. He advocated impeaching Nixon while challenging the incumbent, calling the Vietnam War illegal and the president's conduct of it immoral. When he visited Vietnam, McCloskey discounted the optimistic projections of military and political leaders in both countries and sought the counsel of sergeants and lieutenants who were seeing combat, per the Washington Post. After his first trip in 1968, he said he had \"grave doubts that what we do there is right.\" McCloskey became a leader in congressional efforts to bring US troops home.\n\nMcCloskey's enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. He co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities unseated seven of 12 Congress members who voted against environmental protections. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008, per the AP. \"My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\" Denis Hayes, co-organizer of Earth Day, assessed the rarity of a \"green, anti-war Republican,\" saying, \"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one.\" (More", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_cronin@newser.com", "name": "Bob Cronin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Purple Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

Tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Americans were dying in a war that could not be won, he argued. \"To talk, as the president does, of winding down the war while he is expanding the use of air power is a deliberate deception,\" Mr. McCloskey said. \"I'll probably get licked, but I can't keep quiet.\"\n\nRead more: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/pete-mccloskey-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.qU0.8VQS.G0sCPkKpy5cZ&smid=url-share", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Pete McCloskey, R-Calif., before, during, and after he served in Congress from 1967-82.\n\nIndeed, going back to the 1967 special election in which McCloskey defeated one-time child star Shirley Temple Black in a nationally watched race, to his challenge to President Richard Nixon in the 1972 primaries, to his more recent bids for office and public disputes over issues from Iraq to Israel, McCloskey seemed to be disputatious and unyielding in the public arena until his death Wednesday at age 96.\n\nIndeed, McCloskey could easily have been dubbed a RINO (Republican In Name Only) had the term, used by many on the right now refer to Republicans whom they feel aren't conservative enough, had it existed in his heyday.\n\nHe was the first Republican House member to call for withdrawal of the U.S. from Vietnam, the first to endorse Earth Day and fully embrace the environmental movement of the 1970s, was pro-choice from the day the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion came down, and was a fierce opponent of the U.S.-led strike at Iraq in 2003.\n\nHe defended all his opinions with the fierceness he had shown in the Marine Corps.\n\nBeing a Marine was a major part of McCloskey's persona, and even his most virulent opponents conceded the Northern Californian was a true-blue war hero. After enlisting in the U.S. Navy out of high school and serving from 1945-47, McCloskey signed up as a Marine in 1950 and saw combat in the Korean War.\n\nServing in a platoon in which 58 of his 61 fellow Marines were killed or wounded, McCloskey was awarded two Purple Hearts and the Silver Star. For heroism in the last-ever bayonet charge by Marines, he was awarded the Navy Cross for \"extraordinary heroism.\"\n\nMcCloskey, who remained in the Marine Corps reserve until retiring as a colonel, would later tell friends he had nightmares about killing North Korean soldiers.\n\nMcCloskey, a graduate of Stanford University and its law school, served as an assistant district attorney in Alameda County and later became a partner in a Palo Alto law firm. A leader in Young Lawyers for Nixon-Lodge in 1960, McCloskey refused to support GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater four years later because of the Arizona senator's opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. McCloskey also set his sites on the seat of Republican Rep. J. Arthur Younger.\n\nRep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., a former Younger staffer, recalled to Newsmax: \"Mr. Younger was a conservative and very much disliked McCloskey. He would have preferred a dozen other Republicans as a successor and would never have supported McCloskey.\"\n\nYounger's sudden death in 1967 denied him the opportunity to choose a favored successor. Initially, Shirley Temple Black was seen as the front-runner in the special election. She drew huge drew huge crowds (where local bands played her former theme song \"On The Good Ship Lollypop\"), had neighbors Bing and Kathryn Crosby raising funds for her, and campaigned as a strong supporter of a U.S. victory in Vietnam.\n\nMcCloskey campaigned as one of the first Republicans anywhere to support a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, immediate negotiations with Communist North Vietnam, and reunification of North and South Vietnam under the 1954 Geneva accords. With two other conservatives drawing votes from Black, McCloskey defeated her by about 35% to 22%.\n\nMcCloskey's rugged good looks and baritone voice made him immediately noticed among House Republicans. So did his opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1972, McCloskey ran as an anti-war candidate in the Republican primaries against Nixon. McCloskey's insurgent candidacy faded after drawing only 19% in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nMcCloskey would eventually end up with one national convention delegate from New Mexico, which, when announced at the Miami convention, drew lusty boos.\n\n\"Pete McCloskey is having fund-raising difficulties and has had to auction off his favorite painting -- 'Benedict Arnold Crossing the Delaware!'\" joked Vice President Spiro Agnew during the primary campaigns. A year later, when Agnew was facing indictment for taking kick-backs while governor of Maryland years before, McCloskey strongly sided with his old antagonist and said he agreed with him that a vice president had to be impeached before he was indicted.\n\nNixon supporters and conservatives thought McCloskey was doomed in 1974 when he faced a one-on-one primary challenge from conservative businessman Gordon Knapp. The late Norm Turnette, longtime Western States field man for the Republican National Committee, once recalled to Newsmax how Rep. John Rousselot, McCloskey's fellow California Republican and a top official of the John Birch Society, nonetheless came to campaign for onetime high school classmate McCloskey.\n\n\"Pete and Johnny disagreed on just about everything, but they were true friends since high school,\" said Turnette. \"So we had an event billed as 'The fastest gun on the right and the fastest gun on the left.' Johnny made a strong speech about the Republicans needing people they didn't always agree with to win the House.\"\n\nAfter conceding defeat to Knapp twice, McCloskey, as it turned out, won by 867 votes.\n\nIn the late 1970s, McCloskey made headlines by opposing a $2.2 billion aid package to Israel for its annexation of the Golan Heights, saying, \"We have to respect the views of our Jewish citizens but not be controlled by them.\" When leaders of the American Jewish community denounced McCloskey for his references to the \"Jewish lobby,\" he responded by saying, \"There is a strong Jewish lobby. ... I do not understand why the Jewish community should resent it being referred to as such.\"\n\nIn 1982, conservatives feared that the liberal McCloskey might just top a field of 12 in the Republican primary for an open U.S. Senate seat. But moderate San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson managed to eke out a win and went on to the Senate.\n\nMcCloskey's twilight years were spent practicing law, backpacking, and fly-fishing in northern California. He spoke out against the Iraqi War and endorsed Democrat John Kerry for President in 2004. In 2002, McCloskey he challenged Republican Rep. Richard Pombo (to whom he had once contributed $100) and drew 32% of the vote. McCloskey thereupon supported Democrat Jerry McNerney, who unseated Pombo in the fall.\n\nMcCloskey became a Democrat in 2007 and, in his 80s, supported assisted suicide laws.\n\nPete McCloskey was inarguably a controversial and contrarian figure. But even those who opposed him agreed he was a patriot who served his country honorably in war and did what he felt was right, as much as it irked even those who admired him, in peace.\n\nJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.

Nixon's war policies in Vietnam with a spirited but futile race for the Republican presidential nomination in 1972, died on Wednesday at his home in Winters, west of Sacramento. He was 96.\n\nHis death was announced in a statement released on Wednesday by a family spokesman, Lee Houskeeper.\n\nMcCloskey, who represented the 12th Congressional District on the Peninsula for 15 years, from late 1967 to early 1983, was a liberal Republican who admired President John F. Kennedy, voted for environmental causes with Democrats and believed that the Republican Party had veered too far to the right.\n\nMcCloskey had lived for many years in Woodside and had a home in Portola Valley, as well as a farm in Rumsey, northwest of Sacramento. He was a trustee for the Monterey Institute of International Studies and led efforts to help veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars receive college educations on their return from duty.\n\nIn July 1971, with the nation divided over the war and Nixon heavily favored for re-election, McCloskey, a then 43-year-old Korean War hero and two-term congressman best known for defeating Shirley Temple Black in a special election, launched his quixotic quest for the Republican nomination.\n\nHe had no money, party support or realistic prospects. But he had gone to Vietnam three times, and in campaign appearances he vividly portrayed the war's \"cruelty and futility,\" as he put it, evoking cluster bombs that killed or maimed anyone within 25 acres, and napalm strikes that burned all within 150 feet at 2,000 degrees. Tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Americans were dying in a war that could not be won, he argued.\n\n\"To talk, as the president does, of winding down the war while he is expanding the use of air power is a deliberate deception,\" Mr. McCloskey said. \"I'll probably get licked, but I can't keep quiet.\"\n\nThere were comparisons to the 1968 antiwar campaign of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy, whose success in the New Hampshire primary contributed to President Lyndon B. Johnson's withdrawal from the race. But McCloskey won only 20 percent in New Hampshire and gave up, though his name appeared on ballots in other states. Nixon went on to win the presidency in a landslide, defeating Senator George McGovern, before resigning in disgrace in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal.\n\nWhile his presidential run brought him national prominence, McCloskey was known in later years for environmental legislation. His bills included the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which has become a shield for the habitats of birds, alligators and other species. He was co-chairman of the first Earth Day, in 1970, and received awards for environmental service.\n\nHe also wrote books, including \"Truth and Untruth: Political Deceit in America\" (1972). After leaving Congress, he practiced law in Redwood City, Calif., bought a farm in Yolo County and lectured at colleges and universities in the Bay Area.\n\nPaul Norton McCloskey Jr. was born in Loma Linda, Calif., on Sept. 29, 1927, to Paul N. and Vera McNabb McCloskey. His father and grandfather were lawyers and Republicans. Pete, as he was known, attended a military academy in San Marino, graduated from South Pasadena High School in 1945, joined the Navy and attended Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology under a Navy program. He graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in 1950.\n\nHe and Caroline Wadsworth were married in 1949 and had four children. The marriage ended in divorce. He later married Helen Hooper. He is survived by his wife; his children, Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen McCloskey; and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nA square-jawed man with a military bearing, McCloskey joined the Marines in 1950, when the Korean War broke out. The next year, he was wounded leading a rifle platoon in a bayonet charge to capture a strategic hill, an exploit detailed in his 1992 book, \"The Taking of Hill 610: And Other Essays on Friendship.\" He won the Navy Cross, two Purple Hearts and the Silver Star and served for many years as a Marine reserve officer.\n\nAfter earning a law degree at Stanford in 1953, Mr. McCloskey was a deputy district attorney in Alameda County until 1954. He practiced general and environmental law in Palo Alto from 1955 to 1967, and lectured on legal ethics at the Santa Clara and Stanford law schools.\n\nIn 1963, Charles Daly, a Marine buddy then on the White House staff, put Mr. McCloskey on a list of lawyers invited to a White House conference on civil rights. President Kennedy's address to the gathering inspired him to enter politics, McCloskey said.\n\nHis chance came in 1967. He was elected to Congress from San Mateo County to fill a vacancy created by the death of Representative J. Arthur Younger, upsetting Black and other candidates. He went to Washington as a fiscal conservative but as a liberal on racial, antiwar, environmental and other issues. He was the first House member to call for Nixon's impeachment in the Watergate scandal.\n\nHe was re-elected seven times, but was not a candidate in 1982. Instead, he lost a crowded primary race for the United States Senate to the mayor of San Diego and a future California governor, Pete Wilson. Wilson went on to win the Senate seat in the general election, defeating the Democrat Jerry Brown.\n\nIn 1987, McCloskey was sued for libel by the television evangelist Pat Robertson, then running for the Republican presidential nomination. After Robertson claimed that he had been a combat Marine in the Korean War, McCloskey, who had been in his unit, contended that Robertson's father, U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson, a Virginia Democrat, had used his influence to keep his son out of combat.\n\nWith many other former Marine officers willing to testify that Robertson had avoided combat duty, Robertson dropped his $35 million suit in 1988 and agreed to pay McCloskey's court costs, saying he could not pursue the suit and run for president at the same time.\n\nBut it was a clear victory for McCloskey, who said he had unmasked Robertson as \"the fraud he is.\" (Robertson, who quit the presidential race, did serve in Korea, but chiefly as a supply officer far from combat duty.)\n\nAttempting a political comeback in 2006, McCloskey lost a primary fight against Rep. Richard W. Pombo, a seven-term Republican who opposed environmental reforms. McCloskey, ever the maverick, endorsed the Democrat, Jerry McNerney, in the general election, and Pombo lost. The next year, at age 79, McCloskey switched his affiliation to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The new brand of Republicanism,\" which he described as hostile to progressive causes, had finally led him to abandon the party he joined in 1948, McCloskey wrote in a letter to The Tracy Press, a California weekly whose articles and editorials were widely discussed in news and opinion forums in the state.\n\nMcCloskey and Helen McCloskey are the subjects of a documentary film, \"Helen and the Bear,\" released recently by his niece Alix Blair, a filmmaker.\n\n\"Just as he lived his life with courage, action, and compassion,\" Ms. Blair said in the family statement, \"Pete brought those qualities to their marriage. The film is a celebration of his open heartedness.\"\n\nRobert D. McFadden is a reporter with The New York Times.

(AP) -- Pete McCloskey -- a pro-environment, anti-war California Republican who co-wrote the Endangered Species Act and co-founded Earth Day -- has died. He was 96.\n\nA fourth-generation Republican \"in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt,\" he often said, McCloskey represented the 12th Congressional District for 15 years, running for president against an incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. He battled party leaders while serving seven terms in Congress and went on to publicly disavow the GOP in his later years.\n\nYears after leaving Washington, McCloskey made one last bid for elective office in 2006 when he challenged Richard Pombo of Northern California's 11th District in a primary race that McCloskey described as \"a battle for the soul of the Republican Party.\" After losing to Pombo, who had spent most of his tenure in Washington attempting to undo the Endangered Species Act, he threw his support behind Democrat Jerry McNerney, the eventual winner.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bush administration as reasons why he switched parties in 2007 at the age of 79.\n\n\"A pox on them and their values,\" he wrote in an open letter explaining the switch to his supporters.\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on Sept. 29, 1927, as Paul Norton McCloskey Jr., he graduated from South Pasadena High School, where the second baseman made the school's baseball hall of fame, although he self-deprecatingly called himself \"perhaps the worst player on the baseball team.\"\n\nHe earned a law degree from Stanford University and founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto before making the move to public office. In 1967, he defeated fellow Republican Shirley Temple Black and Democrat Roy Archibald in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat.\n\nThe left-leaning McCloskey had a thundering presence in Washington, attempting to get onto the floor of the 1972 Republican National Convention during his bid to unseat then-President Nixon on an anti-Vietnam War platform. He ultimately was blocked by a rule written by his friend and law school debate partner, John Ehrlichman, that said a candidate could not get to the floor with fewer than 25 delegates. McCloskey had one.\n\nStill, McCloskey loved to say he finished second.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHe would later visit Ehrlichman in prison, where Nixon's former counsel served 1.5 years for conspiracy, perjury and obstruction of justice in the Watergate break-in that led to the president's resignation.\n\nWhile in office, McCloskey also was known for befriending Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and criticized Israeli influence on American politics. The congressman was the first to demand Nixon's impeachment, and the first to demand a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that allowed the Vietnam War.\n\nBut his enduring legacy is the Endangered Species Act, which protects species designated as endangered or threatened and conserves the ecosystems on which they depend. McCloskey co-wrote the legislation in 1973, after a campaign by young people empowered by Earth Day activities successfully unseated seven of 12 Congress members known as \"The Dirty Dozen\" for their anti-environment votes.\n\n\"On that day, the world changed,\" McCloskey recalled in 2008. \"Suddenly, everybody was an environmentalist. My Republican colleagues started asking me for copies of old speeches I had given on water and air quality.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in the House, he lost his run for a Senate seat to Republican Pete Wilson, who went on to be California's governor. He moved back to rural Yolo County, relishing the life of a farmer and part-time attorney.\n\n\"You know, if people call you 'congressman' all the time, you'll end up thinking you're smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey, however, couldn't stay quiet forever.\n\nIn 2006, after his unsuccessful race against Pombo, he helped form the Revolt of the Elders Coalition, a group of retired Republican congressmen who pushed to get soldiers more money for college, undo measures that made it tougher to investigate ethics violations and rallied against those who had received funding from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Pombo.\n\n\"If you can do something at age 80 that positively affects our country, you should be proud of it. Otherwise there's no redeeming value in getting older,\" he said.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife, Helen -- his longtime press secretary whom he married in 1978 -- and four children by his first wife: Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen.\n\n---\n\nThis story contains biographical information compiled by former AP writer Tracie Cone.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Paul N. \"Pete\" McCloskey, R-Calif., shows aerial photos of villages in Laos while appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became a fierce dissenter of the Vietnam War after returning from visits to Southeast Asia in 1968, saying he had \"grave doubts that what we do there is right.\" Linda Wheeler/The Washington Post\n\nPaul N. \"Pete\" McCloskey, a Republican congressman and decorated Marine who turned against his own party leader, President Richard Nixon, accusing him of expanding an \"illegal\" war in Vietnam and calling for his impeachment over the conflict while challenging him for reelection, died May 8 at his home in Winters, Calif. He was 96.\n\nThe cause was congestive heart failure, said family spokesperson Lee Houskeeper.\n\nBefore he drew national headlines for excoriating Nixon, McCloskey had been best known for defeating Shirley Temple Black, the former Hollywood child star, in a 1967 special election for a House seat representing what is now the Silicon Valley area of California.\n\nDuring his tenure, which lasted until 1983, McCloskey became known to his admirers and detractors either as a principled maverick or as a gadfly firebrand. A Marine Corps rifle platoon commander during the Korean War, he received some of the military's top awards for valor - including the Navy Cross and the Silver Star - and used his military credentials as leverage to steer his party away from hard-line conservative elements on issues including race relations and the environment.\n\nCalling himself a \"Teddy Roosevelt progressive,\" he worked to gain passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, helped organize the first Earth Day that year and supported the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nIn the public eye, the defining issue for McCloskey became Vietnam and what he considered Nixon's \"immoral\" conduct of the war. On visits to Vietnam in 1968, he ignored whatever hopeful predictions were still being issued from political and military leaders in Saigon and Washington.\n\nInstead, he sought out sergeants and lieutenants - men who were seeing combat first hand, as he had in Korea as a young officer. In January 1968, he returned from his first visit to Vietnam \"with grave doubts that what we do there is right.\"\n\nThe American military incursion into Cambodia in April 1970 and Nixon's failure to answer several of McCloskey's written inquiries turned the congressman into a fierce dissenter.\n\nWith eight other members of Congress, McCloskey supported the national student antiwar protest of October 1969. He helped draft a motion to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964, a congressional measure that had authorized the president to widen military operations against North Vietnam, and became a leader in House efforts to disengage U.S. forces from Southeast Asia.\n\nIn a Feb. 10, 1971, speech at Stanford University, his alma mater, McCloskey called for a \"national dialogue\" to discuss Nixon's impeachment, a proposal meant to bring about a fundamental policy change on the war. McCloskey asserted that Nixon, like President Lyndon B. Johnson before him, had breached the Constitution \"through the arrogant use of power\" and that some of America's tactics in Southeast Asia amounted to war crimes.\n\nSix days after the speech, McCloskey elaborated on his views in a television interview: \"We've lost the stomach to fight this war on the ground, and yet we think it's appropriate that we can kill people by push-button bombing from 50,000 feet.\"\n\nWith an antiwar speech on the House floor soon after his talk at Stanford, McCloskey attracted more attention by asserting that \"a reasonable argument can be made that the President's recent decision to employ American air power in the neutral countries of Laos and Cambodia exceeds his constitutional powers.\" He told journalists that, if a more politically seasoned Republican did not step up, he would run against Nixon himself.\n\nVice President Spiro T. Agnew called McCloskey, who was in the vanguard of the \"Dump Nixon\" movement, \"a Benedict Arnold.\"\n\nThere was brief speculation that McCloskey might be \"another McCarthy\" in 1972, an allusion to Sen. Eugene McCarthy, the Minnesota Democrat whose strong showing as an antiwar presidential candidate helped drive Johnson from office in 1968.\n\nBut the political landscape was different in 1972. Nixon was winding down the Vietnam conflict, albeit far too slowly for his critics, and peace negotiations were inching along in Paris. The White House largely ignored McCloskey, who was met with stony silence from party eminences and never gained traction in the Republican primaries.\n\nMany voters who detested Nixon were gravitating to Sen. George S. McGovern (S.D.), the Democratic nominee, who was swamped by Nixon in the general election.\n\nIn June 1973, as the Watergate scandal was unfolding, McCloskey again said the impeachment of Nixon should be considered, this time for obstruction of justice. The following summer, Nixon's own tape recordings showed that he had engaged in a coverup. Faced with all but certain impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate, he resigned on Aug. 9, 1974.\n\nPaul Norton McCloskey Jr. was born in Loma Linda, Calif., on Sept. 29, 1927. Like his father, a lawyer, he was also known as Pete.\n\nHe grew up in South Pasadena, where he was a star on his high school baseball team. After Navy service from 1945 to 1947, he graduated from Stanford in 1950 and from Stanford's law school in 1953.\n\nHis education had been interrupted by two years in the Marines during the Korean War. As a rifle platoon commander in May 1951, he led a successful assault against a heavily fortified enemy hill position despite grievous wounds and continued to lead the charge until the bunkers were silenced, with 40 enemy soldiers killed and 22 captured, according to his Navy Cross citation.\n\nA few months later, McCloskey received the Silver Star for a battle in which his platoon came under withering fire while making its way across a valley in support of a tank patrol. Eight of his men were struck down, and McCloskey sustained a severe leg wound, for which he refused treatment. Despite great loss of blood, he continued to direct his men's evacuation to safety.\n\nMcCloskey, who became a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Reserve, also received two Purple Hearts; decades later, he gave one away to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), saying she had not been publicly recognized enough after being ambushed and shot as a young congressional staffer while in Guyana to investigate Jim Jones's death cult in 1978.\n\nAs a young lawyer, McCloskey set up a practice near Stanford and specialized in what he called \"impossible cases\": defending gay people, members of minority groups and others who had trouble finding legal help. He took an early interest in cases involving conservation and environmental protection.\n\nMcCloskey's entry into public life could be traced in part to a 1963 White House gathering on civil rights to which he had been invited. He said the experience encouraged him to counter the rise of the John Birch Society and other extremist elements in the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1964, he refused to support the hard-right campaign of Sen. Barry M. Goldwater (R-Ariz.) for president. That year, McCloskey co-founded the California Republican League to help the party regain some of its more liberal traditions.\n\nMcCloskey was first elected to the House on Dec. 12, 1967, easily defeating Democrat Roy Archibald to fill an open seat. But the more notable contest was the Republican primary, in which McCloskey was the underdog against Black. Her lackluster campaign was not helped by bands playing \"On the Good Ship Lollipop,\" hearkening to her movie days.\n\nMcCloskey's first marriage, to Caroline Wadsworth, ended in divorce. He later married Helen Hooper, his onetime congressional press secretary. In addition to his wife of 42 years, survivors include four children from his first marriage, Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen McCloskey; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nMcCloskey lost campaigns for the Senate in 1982 and for the House in 2006. Long opposed to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, he registered as a Democrat in 2007. He continued to practice law and grow olives and oranges on a farm in the Sacramento Valley. And he continued to express revulsion over the state of national politics, noting the influence of \"big money\" that has made the United States a \"militaristic and arrogant nation.\"\n\nIn 2014, when he was 86, McCloskey traveled to North Korea, hoping to meet men who had fought for their country. The former Marine had been haunted by memories of leading bayonet charges against enemy soldiers, some only teenagers, and seeing terror on their faces.\n\nA meeting was arranged with a retired three-star general, a man of McCloskey's age. \"I told him how bravely I thought his people had fought,\" McCloskey told the Los Angeles Times, \"and we embraced.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: obituary Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Platoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eugene McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Paul N. \"Pete\" McCloskey (R-Calif.) shows aerial pictures of villages in Laos, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee following a visit to Southeast Asia. (Linda Wheeler/The Washington Post)\n\nPaul N. \"Pete\" McCloskey, a Republican congressman and decorated Marine who turned against his own party leader, President Richard M. Nixon, accusing him of expanding an \"illegal\" war in Vietnam and calling for his impeachment over the conflict while challenging him for reelection, died May 8 at his home in Winters, Calif. He was 96.\n\nThe cause was congestive heart failure, said family spokesperson Lee Houskeeper.\n\nBefore he drew national headlines for excoriating Nixon, McCloskey had been best known for defeating Shirley Temple Black, the former Hollywood child star, in a 1967 special election for a House seat representing what is now the Silicon Valley area of California.\n\nDuring his tenure, which lasted until 1983, McCloskey became known to his admirers and detractors either as a principled maverick or as a gadfly firebrand. A Marine Corps rifle platoon commander during the Korean War, he received some of the military's top awards for valor - including the Navy Cross and the Silver Star - and used his military credentials as leverage to steer his party away from hard-line conservative elements on issues including race relations and the environment.\n\nCalling himself a \"Teddy Roosevelt progressive,\" he worked to gain passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, helped organize the first Earth Day that year and supported the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In the public eye, the defining issue for McCloskey became Vietnam and what he considered Nixon's \"immoral\" conduct of the war. On visits to Vietnam in 1968, he ignored whatever hopeful predictions were still being issued from political and military leaders in Saigon and Washington. Instead, he sought out sergeants and lieutenants - men who were seeing combat first hand, as he had in Korea as a young officer. In January 1968, he returned from his first visit to Vietnam \"with grave doubts that what we do there is right.\"\n\nThe American military incursion into Cambodia in April 1970 and Nixon's failure to answer several of McCloskey's written inquiries turned the congressman into a fierce dissenter. With eight other members of Congress, McCloskey supported the national student antiwar protest of October 1969. He helped draft a motion to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964, a congressional measure that had authorized the president to widen military operations against North Vietnam, and became a leader in House efforts to disengage U.S. forces from Southeast Asia. In a Feb. 10, 1971, speech at Stanford University, his alma mater, McCloskey called for a \"national dialogue\" to discuss Nixon's impeachment, a proposal meant to bring about a fundamental policy change on the war. McCloskey asserted that Nixon, like President Lyndon B. Johnson before him, had breached the Constitution \"through the arrogant use of power\" and that some of America's tactics in Southeast Asia amounted to war crimes.\n\nSix days after the speech, McCloskey elaborated on his views in a television interview: \"We've lost the stomach to fight this war on the ground, and yet we think it's appropriate that we can kill people by push-button bombing from 50,000 feet.\" With an antiwar speech on the House floor soon after his talk at Stanford, McCloskey attracted more attention by asserting that \"a reasonable argument can be made that the President's recent decision to employ American air power in the neutral countries of Laos and Cambodia exceeds his constitutional powers.\" He told journalists that, if a more politically seasoned Republican did not step up, he would run against Nixon himself.\n\nVice President Spiro T. Agnew called McCloskey, who was in the vanguard of the \"Dump Nixon\" movement, \"a Benedict Arnold.\" There was brief speculation that McCloskey might be \"another McCarthy\" in 1972, an allusion to Sen. Eugene McCarthy, the Minnesota Democrat whose strong showing as an antiwar presidential candidate helped drive Johnson from office in 1968.\n\nBut the political landscape was different in 1972. Nixon was winding down the Vietnam conflict, albeit far too slowly for his critics, and peace negotiations were inching along in Paris. The White House largely ignored McCloskey, who was met with stony silence from party eminences and never gained traction in the Republican primaries. Many voters who detested Nixon were gravitating to Sen. George S. McGovern (S.D.), the Democratic nominee, who was swamped by Nixon in the general election. In June 1973, as the Watergate scandal was unfolding, McCloskey again said the impeachment of Nixon should be considered, this time for obstruction of justice. The following summer, Nixon's own tape recordings showed that he had engaged in a coverup. Faced with all but certain impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate, he resigned on Aug. 9, 1974. Paul Norton McCloskey Jr. was born in Loma Linda, Calif., on Sept. 29, 1927. Like his father, a lawyer, he was also known as Pete. He grew up in South Pasadena, where he was a star on his high school baseball team. After Navy service from 1945 to 1947, he graduated from Stanford in 1950 and from Stanford's law school in 1953. His education had been interrupted by two years in the Marines during the Korean War. As a rifle platoon commander in May 1951, he led a successful assault against a heavily fortified enemy hill position despite grievous wounds and continued to lead the charge until the bunkers were silenced, with 40 enemy soldiers killed and 22 captured, according to his Navy Cross citation.\n\nA few months later, McCloskey received the Silver Star for a battle in which his platoon came under withering fire while making its way across a valley in support of a tank patrol. Eight of his men were struck down, and McCloskey sustained a severe leg wound, for which he refused treatment. Despite great loss of blood, he continued to direct his men's evacuation to safety.\n\nMcCloskey, who became a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Reserve, also received two Purple Hearts; decades later, he gave one away to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), saying she had not been publicly recognized enough after being ambushed and shot as a young congressional staffer while in Guyana to investigate Jim Jones's death cult in 1978.\n\nAs a young lawyer, McCloskey set up a practice near Stanford and specialized in what he called \"impossible cases\": defending gay people, members of minority groups and others who had trouble finding legal help. He took an early interest in cases involving conservation and environmental protection. McCloskey's entry into public life could be traced in part to a 1963 White House gathering on civil rights to which he had been invited. He said the experience encouraged him to counter the rise of the John Birch Society and other extremist elements in the Republican Party. In 1964, he refused to support the hard-right campaign of Sen. Barry M. Goldwater (R-Ariz.) for president. That year, McCloskey co-founded the California Republican League to help the party regain some of its more liberal traditions. McCloskey was first elected to the House on Dec. 12, 1967, easily defeating Democrat Roy Archibald to fill an open seat. But the more notable contest was the Republican primary, in which McCloskey was the underdog against Black. Her lackluster campaign was not helped by bands playing \"On the Good Ship Lollipop,\" hearkening to her movie days. McCloskey's first marriage, to Caroline Wadsworth, ended in divorce. He later married Helen Hooper, his onetime congressional press secretary. In addition to his wife of 42 years, survivors include four children from his first marriage, Nancy, Peter, John and Kathleen McCloskey; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. McCloskey lost campaigns for the Senate in 1982 and for the House in 2006. Long opposed to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, he registered as a Democrat in 2007. He continued to practice law and grow olives and oranges on a farm in the Sacramento Valley. And he continued to express revulsion over the state of national politics, noting the influence of \"big money\" that has made the United States a \"militaristic and arrogant nation.\" In 2014, when he was 86, McCloskey traveled to North Korea, hoping to meet men who had fought for their country. The former Marine had been haunted by memories of leading bayonet charges against enemy soldiers, some only teenagers, and seeing terror on their faces. A meeting was arranged with a retired three-star general, a man of McCloskey's age. \"I told him how bravely I thought his people had fought,\" McCloskey told the Los Angeles Times, \"and we embraced.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Platoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eugene McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

McCloskey was 96.\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox28spokane.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spokane, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spokane, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Featured-Image-Fallback-National-News-28.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551358", "eventUri": "eng-9551358", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fresno, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

He went on to serve seven terms in the U.S. House until 1982, when he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBefore getting into politics, McCloskey served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War, where he was awarded the Navy Cross and Silver Star.\n\n\"I got wounded twice,\" McCloskey told ABC7 in an interview. \"The ridge lines were so narrow that you couldn't say 'Sergeant, take the hill.'

He was 96.\n\nMcCloskey was a rarity in American politics - his actions were guided by his sense of justice, not by political ideology. He hated inequity and did not hesitate to take on members of his own political party.\n\n\" He stood for everyone without a voice and was especially passionate about our environment -- he was afraid of nothing or anyone who sought to take advantage of another,\" said Joe Cotchett, his law partner since 2004. \" He was the epitome of a leader, as demonstrated throughout his entire life.\"\n\nMcCloskey was born in the Southern California city of Loma Linda, to a family with deep roots in California. His great-grandfather, orphaned during the Irish potato famine, came to San Francisco in 1853. One grandfather was a U.S. attorney and captain of the National Guard unit that helped control rioting in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. His maternal grandfather was mayor of San Bernardino in the early 1900s.\n\nMcCloskey attended South Pasadena High School. As Valedictorian for his graduating class, he spoke in support of the formation of the United Nations. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1950 from Stanford University, as well as his law degree in 1953, the latter interrupted by his service in the US Marine Corps.\n\nMcCloskey joined the Marine Corps as an officer and famously led his rifle platoon during some of the most intense fighting of the Korean War, including six bayonet assaults. During his 10 months in North Korea, 58 of the 61 members of his platoon were either killed or wounded. He was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism, the Nation's second-highest honor, and the highest award given by the Marine Corps. He was also awarded the Silver Star for bravery in combat, and two Purple Hearts.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1960, he commanded a Marine Reserve Rifle Company, and participated in counter-insurgency training. He volunteered for the Vietnam War, however, after a fact-finding trip to the war-torn country in 1971, he reversed course and became an outspoken opponent of the war. He called the bombing in Cambodia a \"greater evil than we have done to any country in the world.\"\n\n\" I don't think you can impose democracy or any system of government through the barrel of a gun without the people resenting what you are trying to impress on them,\" he told Rob Caughlan, who produced a video biography of McCloskey which aired on PBS entitled Leading from the Front, which was narrated by actor, friend and fellow war veteran turned anti-war activist Paul Newman.\n\n\" I've known some great men in my long life, but none that ever matched McCloskey,\" said Chuck Daly, a highly-decorated rifle platoon commander who served with McCloskey in Korea and later became a special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and director of the Kennedy Museum. \" Pete was one of the finest Marines in the Korean War.\"\n\nMcCloskey retired from the Marine Corps Reserve in 1974 with the rank of Colonel.\n\nMcCloskey has lectured on constitutional and military ethics at the Army War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and the Marine Corps Staff College at Quantico, Virginia.\n\nFollowing the Korean War, McCloskey served as Deputy District attorney in Alameda County, then opened a law practice in 1956, which evolved into the Silicon Valley firm of Wilson, Sonsini. He also formed a law partnership with his old friend Lewis Butler of San Francisco. Butler & McCloskey handled only environmental cases. Butler said the two men made very little money, but \"we saved Bay Area tidelands from a housing tract, the town of Volcano from becoming a cement plant, Round Valley from the proposed Corps of Engineers Dos Rios dam and the Napa Valley from subdividing prime vineyards.\"\n\nMcCloskey also served as President of the Palo Alto Bar Association (1960), and President of the Conference of Barristers of the State Bar (1961). In that role, he and Judge Quentin L. Kopp, (Ret) wrote Guide to Professional Conduct for the New Practitioner, (State Bar, 1961).\n\nMcCloskey also served as Trustee of the Santa Clara Bar Association. He has taught Legal Ethics and Political Science as a guest professor at both Stanford University and Santa Clara Law School, as well as to younger students at Thacher School in Ojai.\n\nIn 1967, Pete McCloskey ran for Congress in a special election held following the death of the incumbent Congressman, defeating front-runner child actress Shirley Temple Black. From the beginning of his political career, McCloskey was a Republican maverick, remaining independent of party ideology and pressure.\n\nA lifelong back-packer and fly-fisherman, McCloskey, often referred to as \"a Teddy Roosevelt-style conservationist,\" was fiercely protective of wilderness. In 1970, along with US Senator Gaylord Nelson, he co-founded the first Earth Day, and in 1973, co-authored the Endangered Species Act. He served six years as Congressional Delegate to the International Whaling Conference and as Congressional Advisor to the Law of the Sea Treaty Delegation under Chairmen John Stevenson and Elliot Richardson.\n\n\"With a twinkle in his eye but a titanium backbone, Pete McCloskey spent his whole life campaigning for peace, justice, and a livable future,\" said Denis Hayes, who organized the first Earth Day. \"A powerful champion of endangered species, Pete, ironically, became one: the last remaining progressive, green, anti-war Republican.\"\n\nIn 1972, McCloskey ran against President Richard Nixon for the Republican nomination on an anti-war platform. After Nixon won re-election, McCloskey was the first GOP lawmaker to call for Nixon's impeachment for obstruction of justice when details of the Watergate scandal came out.\n\nMcCloskey, a strong proponent of universal national service, initiated legislation for mandatory service, both civilian and military, with no exemptions for the privileged. The bill had strong bipartisan support but then-President Reagan announced he would veto the bill.\n\nFollowing trips to the Middle East in the late 1970s, three Republicans, Senators Charles Percy, Congressman Paul Findley, and Pete McCloskey, independent of one another, returned with the strong conviction that American foreign policy in the region was unbalanced and would prove over the long run to be disastrous for Israel, for US interests, and for the Palestinian people. McCloskey and a handful of other Members of Congress proposed cuts in aid to Israel for its continuing expansion of settlements in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank, in violation of international law. McCloskey's farewell speech in Congress was in support of a change in the US's Middle East policies to one recognizing both Israel's security issues and the necessity of a recognized State for the Palestinian people.\n\nMcCloskey was re-elected to the House seven times before unsuccessfully running for the Republican nomination to the United States Senate in 1982, losing to Pete Wilson, who went on to defeat Jerry Brown in the general election.\n\nMcCloskey helped end conservative Reverend Pat Robertson's presidential run in 1988, revealing that the televangelist was not a \"combat veteran\" as he had claimed. McCloskey documented how Robertson's father, U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson of Virginia, had used his political influence to get his son out of combat duty by having him sent to Japan for safety during the war.\n\nIn 1989, McCloskey and former Congressman Paul Findley founded the Council for the National Interest, a non-profit organization that advocates for major changes in US policy in the Middle East to promote both regional peace and the long-term US national interest, with an emphasis on the need to address the plight of the Palestinian people.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush appointed McCloskey to the Commission on National and Community Service in 1990. McCloskey was confirmed by the US Senate and elected as the first Chairman of the Commission, serving until the election of President Clinton. The Commission's work led to the creation of Americorps by Congress in 1994.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Mr. McCloskey served on the Department of Defense Advisory Board for the investigation into the No Gun Ri massacre at the start of the Korean War in 1950, and was awarded the Secretary's Outstanding Public Service medal for this work.\n\nIn 2004, his friend and fellow veteran, Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, invited McCloskey to be Of Counsel to the firm. Cotchett, an Army veteran, liked to joke about how the two men bonded four decades ago over their politics and military service. Cotchett jumped out of planes while McCloskey had shrapnel in his body from combat in Korea. Specializing in condemnation and environmental litigation, and with over 100 jury trials under his belt, McCloskey was delighted to join the Cotchett firm, with its strong social and environmental justice mission.\n\nIn 2006, McCloskey again bucked his party, running against seven-term Republican Rep. Richard Pombo of Tracy, accusing the congressman and the California Republican leadership of being corrupted by power. After losing in the primary, he endorsed Pombo's Democratic opponent, Jerry McNerney, who won the general election by virtually the same number of voters who had voted for McCloskey over Pombo in the primary election, and who had crossed party lines in the general election.\n\nDisgusted with the Bush-Cheney Administration's Iraq war and adoption of a policy of condoning torture in violation of the Geneva Conventions, McCloskey became a Democrat in 2007.\n\nMcCloskey played a prominent role in a successful lawsuit filed by him with Joe Cotchett that forced venture capitalist Vinod Khosla to provide public access to Martins Beach, near Half Moon Bay. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Khosla's appeal. Additionally, he and Joe Cotchett won a lawsuit filed on behalf of several environmental groups against the Environmental Protection Agency and Cargill Inc., for failing to protect Redwood City's salt ponds under the Clean Water Act. In April, the EPA and Cargill withdrew appeals of the court's ruling, which said the EPA \"misapplied the law\" when it tried to repeal federal protections for wetlands and ponds. He also took a leadership role in a lawsuit filed by the Surfrider Foundation against pollution from pulp mills in Northern California. McCloskey was extremely active in national environmental lawsuits filed by the Cotchett firm. They won one of the largest clean water actions in American history.\n\n\" Mere words cannot convey the magnitude of Pete's environmental legacy,\" said Lennie Roberts, a legislative advocate for the environmental group Green Foothills. \" As a warrior for Planet Earth, he has given us cleaned-up water, cleaned up the air, and protections for endangered species.\"\n\nMcCloskey, having experienced the physical and psychological trauma of war, had great compassion for the victims of gun violence. On Christmas 2011, he presented Rep. Jackie Speier, then a democrat member of congress from Burlingame, with one of his Purple Hearts for surviving being shot five times during a 1978 investigation of People's Temple founder Jim Jones in Guyana. \" For him to give me one of his Purple Hearts, it took my breath away,\" said Speier, who has the medal framed in her office in Washington D.C. \" That's an extraordinary gift, a gesture that makes me smile about humanity. He's a war hero, but incredibly humble about it.\" Speier said McCloskey was in the habit of calling her to give advice, offer counsel, and discuss the issue of undue corporate and dark money influence over American politics. \"He's one of America's giants in public life,\" Speier said.\n\n\" Pete was a true American hero -- a man of profound courage and integrity who always followed his conscience to reach the right and just result,\" said Frank Pitre, his law partner.\n\nIn 2014, McCloskey returned to North Korea with a delegation headed by Donald Gregg, former US Ambassador to South Korea, and there met with Ji Young Choon, a three-star general he had fought against in a bloody battle. They hugged each other and wept. \" I feel I've had an experience I've wanted to have for 64 years, which is to shake hands with one of the young kids I fought against and tell them how bravely they fought,\" McCloskey told the San Francisco Chronicle after the meeting. \" We agreed that we didn't want our children, grandchildren or great-grandchildren to ever fight in a war.\" Ambassador Gregg explained the inclusion of McCloskey on the trip: \" He was known as the Beowulf of the 5th Marines. But he wanted to make peace. So we thought, what a terrific addition he would be. And he was tremendous.\"\n\nRob Caughlan, who campaigned for McCloskey during his first run for congress, said his friend told him about a recurring nightmare he had later in life in which he looked into the terrified eyes of a group of young soldiers sitting in a ditch just before he gunned them down. The war \" had an effect on his whole life,\" Caughlan said. \" The reason he was such an activist for peace was because of what he experienced in war.\"\n\nInterviewed about McCloskey's trip, his wife Helen, who had traveled previously to Korea with her husband to hike the very terrain he had fought on, told the Los Angeles Times that to quell the residue of a war fought so closely and personally, it was necessary for McCloskey \" to stand face to face with a contemporary who had experienced the same war.\" She added: \" For Pete, psychologically and emotionally, to be able to embrace an enemy combatant was healing and profound. The encounter might just allow him to live a fuller life.\"\n\nThe experience encapsulated the unique blend of courage and compassion that has animated the career of McCloskey, a war hero who spent the rest of his life fighting for peace, championing the environment, and standing up for unrepresented underdogs.\n\nHe was \" the bravest man I have ever known, both in war and politics,\" said Butler, his former law partner.\n\nMcCloskey has written numerous books, among them The U.S. Constitution, (BRL, 1961); and Truth and Untruth- Political Deceit in America (Simon & Schuster, 1971). In 1991, he and his wife published a number of books under their own label, Eaglet Books: The Taking of Hill 610, (Eaglet Books, 1992); A Year in a Marine Rifle Company, (Eaglet Books, 2013); An Honest Public Servant: A Brief Biography of Manuel Lujan (Eaglet Books, 2018); and The Story of the First Earth Day, 1970, (Eaglet Books, 2020). He and his wife co-authored a fifth book, to be released later this year, Assault on the USS Liberty.\n\nMcCloskey and his wife Helen have lived for the past three decades on a working organic farm in Yolo County, from which base they joined forces engaging in environmental causes, both serving on a number of non-profit boards.\n\nIntrigued by their unique marriage, McCloskey's niece, filmmaker Alix Blair recently premiered her documentary film entitled Helen and the Bear. Blair said: \" Just as he lived his life with courage, action, and compassion, Pete brought those qualities to their marriage. The film is a celebration of his open-heartedness.\"\n\nPete is survived by his wife Helen Hooper McCloskey, and his children from his prior marriage to Caroline Wadsworth: Nancy, Peter, John, and Kathleen McCloskey, as well as numerous grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews.\n\nTo view more images of Pete, please click HERE.\n\nDonations in Mr. McCloskey's honor may be made to UN Crisis Relief ( https://crisisrelief.un.org/opt-crisis ) and Medicines Sans Fronti\u00e8res/Doctors Without Borders ( https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/ )\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508596211/en/\n\nCONTACT: Lee Housekeeper\n\n(415) 654-9141 - Cell\n\nNewsService@aol.com\n\nKEYWORD: CALIFORNIA DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA\n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: SPORTS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PHILANTHROPY OTHER PHILANTHROPY MILITARY CONGRESSIONAL NEWS/VIEWS DEFENSE LEGAL PUBLIC POLICY/GOVERNMENT ENVIRONMENT OUTDOORS\n\nSOURCE: Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy\n\nCopyright Business Wire 2024.\n\nPUB: 05/08/2024 06:14 PM/DISC: 05/08/2024 06:14 PM\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508596211/en", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Platoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

said he died peacefully at home in Winters.\n\nOften described as a liberal Republican, McCloskey vehemently opposed the Vietnam War and ran on an anti-war platform to unseat President Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nHe served in Congress from 1967 to 1983, winning reelection seven times, and representing parts of the Peninsula and Silicon Valley.\n\nDuring his congressional tenure, he championed environmental causes, co-authored the 1973 Endangered Species Act and helped launch the first Earth Day.\n\n\"Mere words cannot convey the magnitude of Pete's environmental legacy,\" said Lennie Roberts, a legislative advocate for the environmental group Green Foothills. \"As a warrior for Planet Earth, he has given us cleaned-up water, cleaned up the air, and protections for endangered species.\"\n\nMcCloskey earned both an undergraduate and law degree from Stanford University and served in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1947.\n\nHe also joined the Marine Corps after college and served as a rifle platoon leader during the Korean War, earning both the Navy Cross and Silver Star, as well as two Purple Hearts.\n\nDuring his legal career, McCloskey tried more than 100 cases in front of juries, starting out first as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County and then going on to help found the firm of McCloskey, Wilson & Moshe.\n\nLater in life, McCloskey settled down on an organic farm in Yolo County with his wife Helen and continued to be active in environmental causes, while both serving on various nonprofit boards, according to an announcement from his law firm.\n\nPete is survived by his wife Helen, four children -- Nancy, Peter, John, and Kathleen McCloskey -- and many grandchildren, great-grandchildren and nieces and nephews.", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com",

A Republican with deep roots in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt, McCloskey's political career was marked by his co-authorship of the Endangered Species Act and his role in founding Earth Day. His death was confirmed by Lee Houskeeper, a close family friend, as McCloskey died at his home on Wednesday.\n\nMcCloskey's tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives spanned over seven terms, where he represented California's 12th Congressional District. Notably, he challenged incumbent President Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential primaries, showcasing his willingness to confront party leaders on ethical and policy grounds. His political journey was characterized by his later disavowal of the GOP, citing disillusionment with the direction the party had taken, especially under the George W. Bush administration.\n\nBorn in Loma Linda, California, on September 29, 1927, McCloskey's early life set the stage for a career that would blend public service with environmental activism. After graduating from Stanford University with a law degree, he founded an environmental law firm in Palo Alto. His political career began with a victory in a special election for the San Mateo County congressional seat in 1967, defeating notable candidates including Shirley Temple Black.\n\nMcCloskey's advocacy for environmental issues and his opposition to the Vietnam War were central themes of his career. He was instrumental in drafting the Endangered Species Act in 1973, inspired by the momentum of Earth Day and its role in raising environmental awareness. This legislation remains a cornerstone of environmental protection in the United States.\n\nDespite facing challenges within his party and losing a bid for a Senate seat to Pete Wilson, McCloskey remained active in politics and advocacy. In 2006, he made a final bid for public office against Richard Pombo, criticizing Pombo's efforts to undermine the Endangered Species Act. Although unsuccessful, McCloskey's campaign underscored his commitment to environmental causes and ethical governance.\n\nIn his later years, McCloskey continued to engage in political activism through initiatives like the Revolt of the Elders Coalition. This group focused on supporting veterans and addressing ethics violations within Congress. McCloskey's life was marked by a dedication to public service and environmental stewardship, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire.\n\nMcCloskey is survived by his wife Helen, whom he married in 1978 and served as his longtime press secretary, and four children from his first marriage: Nancy, Peter, John, and Kathleen. His passing marks the end of an era for those who knew him as a congressman, advocate, and friend.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sathish_raman@oneindia.com", "name": "Sathish Raman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_McCloskey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete McCloskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

A Marine Corps rifle platoon commander during the Korean War, he received some of the military's top awards for valor, including the Navy Cross and the Silver Star, and used his military credentials as leverage to steer his party away from hard-line conservative elements on issues including race relations and the environment.\n\nCalling himself a \"Teddy Roosevelt progressive,\" he worked to gain passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, helped organize the first Earth Day that year, and supported the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nIn the public eye, the defining issue for Mr. McCloskey became Vietnam and what he considered Nixon's \"immoral\" conduct of the war. On visits to Vietnam in 1968, he ignored whatever hopeful predictions were still being issued from political and military leaders in Saigon and Washington.\n\nInstead, he sought out sergeants and lieutenants -- men who were seeing combat first hand, as he had in Korea as a young officer. In January 1968, he returned from his first visit to Vietnam \"with grave doubts that what we do there is right.\"\n\nThe American military incursion into Cambodia in April 1970 and Nixon's failure to answer several of Mr. McCloskey's written inquiries turned the congressman into a fierce dissenter.\n\nWith eight other members of Congress, he supported the national student antiwar protest of October 1969. He helped draft a motion to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964, a congressional measure that had authorized the president to widen military operations against North Vietnam, and he became a leader in House efforts to disengage US forces from Southeast Asia.\n\nIn a Feb. 10, 1971, speech at Stanford University, his alma mater, Mr. McCloskey called for a \"national dialogue\" to discuss Nixon's impeachment, a proposal meant to bring about a fundamental policy change on the war. He asserted that Nixon, like President Lyndon B. Johnson before him, had breached the Constitution \"through the arrogant use of power\" and that some of America's tactics in Southeast Asia amounted to war crimes.\n\nSix days after the speech, Mr. McCloskey elaborated on his views in a television interview: \"We've lost the stomach to fight this war on the ground, and yet we think it's appropriate that we can kill people by push-button bombing from 50,000 feet.\"\n\nWith an antiwar speech on the House floor soon after his talk at Stanford, Mr. McCloskey attracted more attention by asserting that \"a reasonable argument can be made that the president's recent decision to employ American air power in the neutral countries of Laos and Cambodia exceeds his constitutional powers.\" He told journalists that, if a more politically seasoned Republican did not step up, he would run against Nixon himself.\n\nVice President Spiro T. Agnew called Mr. McCloskey, who was in the vanguard of the \"Dump Nixon\" movement, \"a Benedict Arnold.\"\n\nThere was brief speculation that Mr. McCloskey might be \"another McCarthy\" in 1972, an allusion to Senator Eugene McCarthy, the Minnesota Democrat whose strong showing as an antiwar presidential candidate helped drive Johnson from office in 1968.\n\nBut the political landscape was different in 1972. Nixon was winding down the Vietnam conflict, albeit far too slowly for his critics, and peace negotiations were inching along in Paris. The White House largely ignored Mr. McCloskey, who was met with stony silence from party eminences and never gained traction in the Republican primaries.\n\nMany voters who detested Nixon were gravitating to Senator George S. McGovern, the Democratic nominee, who was swamped by Nixon in the general election.\n\nIn June 1973, as the Watergate scandal was unfolding, Mr. McCloskey again said the impeachment of Nixon should be considered, this time for obstruction of justice. The following summer, Nixon's own tape recordings showed that he had engaged in a coverup. Faced with all but certain impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate, he resigned on Aug. 9, 1974.\n\nPaul Norton McCloskey Jr. was born in Loma Linda, Calif., on Sept. 29, 1927. Like his father, a lawyer, he was also known as Pete.\n\nHe grew up in South Pasadena, where he was a star on his high school baseball team. After Navy service from 1945 to 1947, he graduated from Stanford in 1950 and from Stanford's law school in 1953.\n\nHis education had been interrupted by two years in the Marines during the Korean War. As a rifle platoon commander in May 1951, he led a successful assault against a heavily fortified enemy hill position despite grievous wounds and continued to lead the charge until the bunkers were silenced, with 40 enemy soldiers killed and 22 captured, according to his Navy Cross citation.\n\nA few months later, he received the Silver Star for a battle in which his platoon came under withering fire while making crossing a valley in support of a tank patrol. Eight of his men were struck down, and Mr. McCloskey sustained a severe leg wound, for which he refused treatment. Despite great loss of blood, he continued to direct his men's evacuation to safety.\n\nMr. McCloskey, who became a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Reserve, received two Purple Hearts for his actions; decades later, he gave one away to Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from his home state, saying she had not been recognized enough after being ambushed and shot as a young congressional staffer while in Guyana to investigate Jim Jones's death cult in 1978.\n\nAs a young lawyer, Mr. McCloskey set up a practice near Stanford and specialized in what he called \"impossible cases\": defending gay people, members of minority groups, and others who had trouble finding legal help. He took an early interest in cases involving conservation and environmental protection.\n\nMr. McCloskey's entry into public life could be traced in part to a 1963 White House gathering on civil rights to which he had been invited. He said the experience encouraged him to counter the rise of the John Birch Society and other extremist elements in the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1964, he refused to support the hard-right campaign of Republican Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona for president. That year, Mr. McCloskey co-founded the California Republican League to help the party regain some of its more liberal traditions.\n\nMr. McCloskey was first elected to the House on Dec. 12, 1967, easily defeating Democrat Roy Archibald to fill an open seat. But the more notable contest was the Republican primary, in which McCloskey was the underdog against Black. Her lackluster campaign was not helped by bands playing \"On the Good Ship Lollipop,\" hearkening to her movie days.\n\nMr. McCloskey's first marriage, to Caroline Wadsworth, ended in divorce. He married Helen Hooper, his onetime congressional press secretary. In addition to his wife of 42 years, he leaves four children from his first marriage, Nancy, Peter, John, and Kathleen McCloskey; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nMr. McCloskey lost campaigns for the Senate in 1982 and for the House in 2006. Long opposed to the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, he registered as a Democrat in 2007. He continued to practice law and grow olives and oranges on a farm in the Sacramento Valley. And he continued to express revulsion over the state of national politics, noting the influence of \"big money\" that has made the United States a \"militaristic and arrogant nation.\"\n\nIn 2014, when he was 86, Mr. McCloskey traveled to North Korea, hoping to meet men who had fought for their country. The former Marine had been haunted by memories of leading bayonet charges against enemy soldiers, some only teenagers, and seeing terror on their faces.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Platoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Tonkin Resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navy Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eugene McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Vietnam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

He said that while the public and devotees of Lord Ram were asserting themselves to support those who brought Lord Ram, 'Ramdrohis' were arguing against the necessity of the Ram temple's construction, questioning its relevance within India.\n\nIn a biting remark, he raised the question of whether the temple would be erected in Kabul, Kandahar, Lahore or Karachi if not in Ayodhya.\n\nHe directly accused the Samajwadi Party of providing shelter to mafias and criminals, referring to them as 'shagird' (disciples) of the SP.\n\nAlleging SP's involvement in violent incidents, Yogi claimed they targeted Ram devotees and shielded those responsible for terrorist attacks.\n\nChief Minister Yogi highlighted the emergence of a new India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. He emphasised that those who attempt security breaches now face swift consequences - \"Aaj suraksha mein sendh lagane walon ko yah pata hai ki aisa karne se pehle Yamraj jeevan ki dor kaat ke le jaenge\".\n\nFurthermore, he urged voters to support BJP candidates: Ajay Mishra Teni for the Kheri Lok Sabha seat, Rekha Verma for the Dhaurahra Lok Sabha seat and Rajesh Verma for the Sitapur Lok Sabha seat.\n\nAddressing an election rally for Kheri Lok Sabha seat at Gola in Lakhimpur Kheri, the chief minister said that the SP would not even be able to open its account in the UP Lok Sabha elections of 2024 and all the five members of the party's first family were set to lose.\n\nThe chief minister highlighted the completion of three phases of elections, stating, \"There is only one voice resounding throughout the country 'Phir Ek Baar, Modi Sarkar'.\"\n\nTaking a dig at opposition, the chief minister remarked: \"The Congress and SP are now claiming that the construction of Ram temple was unnecessary. As the elections unfold, it is evident that it is a battle between Ram devotees committed to India's progress and the well-being of the underprivileged, and 'Ramdrohis' who jeopardise India's security, disparage the nation on global stages, and toy with the principles of Sanatan faith.\"\n\nHe further mentioned that Congress and SP were conspiring to divide the country. \"In the Congress era, the nation faced insecure borders and witnessed a peak of terrorism and Naxalism. Similarly, the SP regime used to open fire at devotees of Shri Ram and withdrew cases against terrorists,\" he said.\n\nAddressing the election rally in support of Dhaurahra candidate at Mohammadi in Lakhimpur Kheri, the chief minister said that as the ongoing Lok Sabha elections reach a critical juncture with half of the constituencies having completed voting in three phases, the populace was echoing the sentiment, 'Jo Ram ko laye hain, hum unko layenge'.\n\nYogi remarked, \"For the first time in the country, we are witnessing a government completing a 10-year tenure, yet the public is resolutely electing BJP candidates to form the Modi government for the third time, brimming with enthusiasm and determination.\"\n\nHe continued, \"The people of India are expressing their gratitude because the Modi government has tirelessly worked towards the development, welfare and dignity of the nation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dedicated himself to illuminating the future of both the current and forthcoming generations by sculpting a new India.\"\n\nAddressing a public gathering in Biswan, Sitapur, Chief Minister Yogi emphasised that the entire election revolves around 'Rambhakts' and 'Ramdrohis'.\n\nHe added, \"The public and Ram devotees are saying that we will bring those who have brought Ram, whereas 'Ramdrohis' are saying that the temple is 'useless', there was no need to construct it. What was the need for a temple inside India.\"\n\nIn a taunting remark, Yogi questioned whether, if not in Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram in Uttar Pradesh, the temple would be constructed in Kabul, Kandahar, Lahore, or Karachi.\n\nHe reiterated Ayodhya's sacred status as the birthplace of Shri Ram and a revered pilgrimage site for millions of followers of Sanatan dharma. He affirmed, \"Ayodhya holds deep religious significance for us. Today's Ayodhya invokes the spirit of the Ramayana period from Tretayuga, while Kashi embodies the essence of Satyug.\"\n\nThe chief minister highlighted the government's ambitious development plan for Naimisharanya, including the initiation of four-lane connectivity projects, the construction of guest houses, and the enhancement of the Gomti riverfront.\n\nAdditionally, efforts are underway to renovate and beautify temples, support local businessmen, and introduce new hotels and restaurants. The introduction of an electric bus service to Lucknow and plans for helicopter connectivity are also in progress. Furthermore, there are plans to extend the metro network from Lucknow to Naimisharanya, he added.\n\nChief Minister Yogi praised the region's robust security environment and cited the example of Radico Khaitan's investment of Rs 1000 crore, which has created job opportunities for hundreds of local youth. He also acknowledged the contribution of an Enforcement Directorate officer who left his job to facilitate the establishment of a promising campus for the region's youth, ensuring a bright future for them.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaurahra_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type":

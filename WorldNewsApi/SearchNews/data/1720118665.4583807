One option if you suspect you're being underpaid is to request a salary adjustment from your employer. But career coaches say you should go into the conversation prepared. \"You should never bring up another co-worker's name in that conversation,\" Dewan said. \"You should never say, 'I had a conversation with Henry. I know we had the same experience [and] the same skills. I realized that he gets paid 20% more than me. I want the same salary as him.'\" This is where that market research comes in handy, along with highlights from your performance review. \"You can't just go to your employer and be like, 'I want to get paid more ... simply based on vibes,\" Machado said. \"When you go for that salary adjustment, you want to bring in other data points [showing] the impact that you've brought to the company, because at the end of the day, they could just find somebody else who's cheaper to do your job as well.\" It's also important to avoid escalating to threats, Cappelli said. \"Often your boss doesn't want to let you go,\" Cappelli told CNBC. \"But the people at the top who are trying to hold the line on pay just say, 'I'm sorry, we can't do it. Good luck.'\"", "summary": "Only 34% of Americans are satisfied with how much they are paid at work, according to a March 2023 Pew Research Center survey.

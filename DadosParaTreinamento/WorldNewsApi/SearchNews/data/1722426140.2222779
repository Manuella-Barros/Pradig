After counting over 12 million votes, Pezeshkian had 5.3 million while Jalili held 4.8 million, Iranian state television reported. Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.6 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 95,000 votes.

There\u2019s been only one runoff presidential election in Iran\u2019s history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Early results in Iran\u2019s presidential election put hard-liner Saeed Jalili slightly ahead Saturday, followed closely behind by reformist Masoud Pezeshkian. The early results, reported by Iranian state television, did not initially put Jalili in a position to win Friday\u2019s election outright, potentially setting the stage for a runoff election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi. It also did not offer any turnout figures for the race yet \u2014 a crucial component of whether Iran\u2019s electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests. With over 10 million votes counted, Jaili had 4.26 million votes, followed by Pezeshkian with 4.24 million. Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohmmad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.38 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 80,000 votes. Voters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors. The voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region \u2014 such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels \u2014 are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build \u2014 should it choose to do so \u2014 several nuclear weapons. There had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said. There\u2019s also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \u201cmoving toward the same level\u201d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian\u2019s generation had in the 1979 revolution. Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the race\u2019s top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There\u2019s been only one runoff presidential election in Iran\u2019s history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. The 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country\u2019s foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab. ___ This story has been corrected to say 10 million was the overall number of votes initially counted.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2lyYW4tcHJlc2lkZW50aWFsLWVsZWN0aW9uLWphbGlsaS1wZXplc2hraWFuLXFhbGliYWYtMTg5YTg5YzNhOWMwNGJlMWFmODNhYjY4NGUyMTM1NTjSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Hard-liner Saeed Jalili leads in early Iran presidential election results, state TV reports</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/iran-presidential-election-jalili-pezeshkian-qalibaf-189a89c3a9c04be1af83ab684e213558", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3b8c021/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1791x1007+0+93/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F6c%2F1e%2Fbfe1711f34a5bd8b2e0b8511adf3%2Fc6704fe28e94426aa450b6e5f2a1def0", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:39:25", "author": "Jon Gambrell,Nasser Karimi", "authors": ["Jon Gambrell", "Nasser Karimi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.274}

The university described the decision as a decision to \u201caccept the return by Mr. Sean Combs of the honorary degree.\u201d Combs, who attended the historically black college in Washington, DC, in the 1990s, was awarded the degree in 2014. The statement appears to be referencing the recent release of 2016 video showing Combs punching and kicking his former long-time girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as the singer Cassie. The university said it would also end long-term relationships with Combs and return a $1m donation he made in 2016 to fund a scholarship, as well as terminate an agreement for another $1m donation from the Sean Combs Foundation. The Independent has contacted the foundation for comment. After the video was obtained by news outlets, Combs apologized, calling his behavior \u201cinexcusable.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\u201d he said in an apology video. \u201cI was f***ed up \u2013 I hit rock bottom \u2013 but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\u201d After the footage surfaced, Cassie said her treatment by Combs \u201cbroke me down to someone I never thought I would become.\u201d In a November lawsuit, Cassie accused Diddy of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and rape, which the musician denied. The pair settled the suit soon after. Since then, six women and one man have accused the music mogul of a host of crimes, including sexual misconduct, drug use, and other forms of abuse. In March, homes belonging to Combs in Los Angeles and Miami were raided in connection to a Homeland Security investigation into sex trafficking. He has denied all wrongdoing. \u201cI have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,\u201d he said in a statement in December. \u201cSickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Music mogul donated $1m to school in 2016 </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/howard-university-diddy-degree-lawsuits-b2559228.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/22/07/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/55ktgNiD-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:27:21", "author": "Josh Marcus", "authors": ["Josh Marcus"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.192}

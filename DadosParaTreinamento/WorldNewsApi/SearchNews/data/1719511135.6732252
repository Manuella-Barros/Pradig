{"id": 223737058, "title": "It was a buzzing night in Chinatown - then the immigration raids started", "text": "It's a beautiful Friday evening in Manchester city centre and the bars and pubs are overflowing with people enjoying the warm weather. But just yards from the sun-drenched beer gardens, others are having their lives turned upside down. In the upstairs room of a Chinese restaurant, a woman is being interrogated by a Home Office immigration officer. Across the hallway, a group of young women are belting out karaoke songs. After a short while, the woman is led out of the restaurant and bundled into the back of a police van. As the drama unfolds, someone dressed in drag watches on from a smoking area across the road. READ MORE: She kept needing the toilet but didn't think anything of it... then the horrific reality hit her The woman, who was found preparing shellfish in the restaurant's kitchen, is believed to have been working illegally. She now faces an uncertain future and the possibility of being removed from the UK. She is one of two people arrested after enforcement officers swooped on a pair of city centre restaurants in a crackdown on illegal working. The Manchester Evening News was invited along to witness the raids, which saw the Home Office act on intelligence received regarding a number of businesses across Greater Manchester. The day begins at a non-descript office block in the shadow of MediaCityUK in Salford. After a short briefing, immigration officers don their stab vests before we pile into the vans and hit the road. After a briefing in the car park of a Sainsbury\u2019s store next to Heaton Park, we set out for Spot On Car Wash in Manchester Old Road, Middleton. The raid is acting on intelligence that the car wash has been employing illegal migrants, including boys as young as 14. Two grey vans pull up on the main road outside before officers jump out and storm the forecourt amid a flurry of scurrying and shouting. Several workers are surrounded as bemused customers watch on and staff at a garage next door record videos on their mobile phones. After proving his right to live and work in the UK, one worker shakes his head and returns to hosing down a grey Mercedes. Another man - an Iranian national - is arrested and escorted off the premises. Although he has an open asylum claim, he is suspected of working illegally, explains HM Inspector Charles Devereux, of Home Immigration Enforcement. The car wash itself is handed a civil penalty referral notice, meaning it could potentially face a fine of up to \u00a360,000. It's not the first time enforcement officers have visited the \u2018notorious\u2019 car wash, Mr Devereux says. The owner has previously received civil penalties, he says, while on a previous visit, one person working there jumped into a car and drove off. Our next stop is Napoleons, a Chinese restaurant at the heart of Manchester's Gay Village. Revellers are enjoying the last of the day's sun when a group of immigration officers sprint along Bloom Street and burst through the door of the restaurant, which was once the city's oldest gay nightclub. We wait outside, the delicious smell of fried food wafting through the entrance where a burly officer stands guard. Two other men in uniform are blocking exits around the corner in Sackville Street on the lookout for runners. Mr Devereux explains that his team visited the restaurant back in February and made five arrests, but one person is believed to have fled. On this occasion, they have been joined by police and licensing officers from Manchester council. After a while, we're waved inside and descend the stairs into a windowless room filled with tables. Behind a water feature, men wearing aprons are being questioned by enforcement officers. There are 13 staff members inside the restaurant, many of whom speak limited English, so an interpreter is being used to help carry out right to work checks on the Home Office database. In one corner of the restaurant, a woman is tucking into a bowl of noodles, her back turned from the commotion. She is either blissfully unaware of what is happening or has seen this sort of thing before. A woman - believed to be a Chinese national - is eventually led upstairs and into a karaoke booth. Through a small window, I can see her being questioned further. Mr Devereux explains that the woman was arrested and bailed when officers visited Napoleons back in February. She had previously applied for a visa but failed to progress her application, he said. It means she is suspected of being present in the UK illegally and could be removed from the country as a result. A civil penalty referral notice has also been served against the business, Mr Devereux explains. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s about trying to drive compliance, it\u2019s not about targeting people to close them down,\" he tells me. \"It\u2019s about making them comply with the rules. Later that evening, diners at Aplus Oriental Restaurant in Chinatown peer up from their plates in shock as immigration officers rush past them and into the kitchen. Next door, groups of young people are queuing outside K2, a popular karaoke bar and nightclub. Some are not happy to see the immigration officers and make their feelings known. \u201cRacist as f***,\u201d shouts one man, who continues to linger outside the restaurant. \u201cAlways hitting Chinatown. You need to pick on somewhere else.\" The Home Office says it executed a warrant at the restaurant after receiving intelligence that people had been working there illegally. In the kitchen at the back, staff are being questioned. One woman is eventually arrested on suspicion of being illegally present in the UK. She's led through the back door and put into the back of a police van outside Manchester Art Gallery. Following the raid, Mr Devereux said: \"I hope that employers will see that immigration enforcement is there not just to enforce the rules and to ensure compliance, but really to drive education. A large-scale business like this, we've done our best to ensure it's allowed to continue working. \"People are still getting their meals, we've tried to limit the impact as much as possible. We'd encourage all employers to work with us to do right to work checks and to see the damage that illegal working can do, not just to businesses but to individuals.\" He said the operation was aimed at \"tackling the threat that illegal working presents to the UK economy\". \"Having a labour market that's fair and open and not abused is best for everybody in the UK,\" he said. \"Illegal working is a challenge nationally. \"There's so many issues that perhaps many of the general public don't appreciate in terms of denial of funds to the treasury through tax avoidance, then you've got at a local level, businesses consistently being undercut. \"If you're following the rules, if you're paying your workers minimum wage and above, then you have unscrupulous employers who are willing to undercut at every opportunity. Most importantly, you've got vulnerable people that need protecting and they can be exploited by those employers. \"Illegal working is an absolute priority for the Home Office.\" In recent years, protesters have attempted to block a number of immigration raids across the UK. Mr Devereux said he recognised 'immigration control is a contentious subject', adding: \"People have some really strongly held beliefs, but what I can say is that my own officers and my own personal experience would say that I have personally helped numerous victims of modern day slavery, trafficking, and taken them out of terrible situations and put them in touch with the agencies to look after them. \"It's a shame that perhaps that doesn't get recognised by the public. As an organisation, I can 100pc say that the Home Office and immigration enforcement really do treat people on a case by case basis. We are trained to look out for vulnerabilities and that is one of our key priorities. \"It can be difficult changing people's minds. I appreciate it's a difficult topic and some people don't want to engage with it.\" When approached by the Manchester Evening News, the owner of Spot On Car Wash denied that he employed any illegal workers, including boys as young as 14. \"I would never do that,\" he said. He said the man arrested was volunteering at the car wash on the day in question. \"I was on holiday,\" he added. \"He came to work voluntarily for one day. He was not being paid.\" Napoleons has been approached for comment. Aplus Oriental restaurant declined to comment.", "summary": "Two people were arrested after enforcement officers swooped on a pair of city centre restaurants", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/buzzing-night-chinatown-immigration-raids-29220626", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29235560.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Raid1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:20:39", "author": "Thomas George", "authors": ["Thomas George"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.117}

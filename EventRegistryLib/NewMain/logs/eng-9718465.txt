While many of the policies will impact the state's 94,000 farmers, the farm bill can also influence food supply, conservation efforts and food-assistance benefits for Hoosiers.\n\nCongress usually reauthorizes a federal farm bill every five years. The current farm bill, which former President Donald Trump signed in December 2018, was supposed to expire in 2023, but was extended through Sept. 30, 2024. The legislation funds programs in 12 different areas including crop insurance, nutrition and rural development.\n\nHowever partisan division has delayed the bill process, which is nearly a year behind schedule.\n\nBrantley Seifers, national affairs director for the Indiana Farm Bureau (INFB), said his organization's main concern with the bill is making sure it gets approved this year.\n\n\"We've put a lot of work into this farm bill. Our members have been advocating for this farm bill for the better part of two years now,\" Seifers told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. \"Making sure it gets done in this Congress and we don't settle with a further extension is going to be very important.\"\n\nIf Congress does not pass the federal farm bill by September, operations for some programs will stop completely or receive significantly less funding. However, some programs supported by the bill -- including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and federal crop insurance -- can still be funded by government appropriations.\n\nDan Boritt, executive director for the Indiana Wildlife Federation, also emphasized the importance of passing the legislation in 2024.\n\n\"If we aren't able to come to an agreement on a farm bill, it would be catastrophic for conservation in the state of Indiana, and the entire country, frankly,\" he said. \"Agriculture is a really, really, really difficult industry to be financially successful in and these dollars allow (farmers) to take those risks, to do good things on the land that benefit all of us.\"\n\nThe proposed House bill increases funding for specialty crops research, expands eligibility for disaster assistance, broadens safety net programs for farmers and encourages farmers to sell their products abroad, among other programs.\n\nSeifers said he views the 2018 Farm Bill as a strong piece of legislation, which just needs tweaking. He said many of the INFB's priorities were included in the House's version of the bill.\n\n\"We're not looking for huge changes in that farm bill, but we are looking for updates to that farm bill,\" Seifers said. \"\"You look at some portions of the bill that haven't been updated in a number of years, like the market access program and foreign market development program, both of those are still stagnant at 20 year levels.\"\n\nPart of the $1.5 trillion bill would support safety net programs and crop insurance for farmers. Seifers said Indiana farmers can recover from flooding and other disasters with this funding.\n\n\"If you go to a bank for a loan on the farm, their first question is going to be 'what's your crop insurance,'\" Seifers said. \"Having that in place and having that be strong for our members, and flexible, is going to allow them to keep working.\"\n\nSteve Howell, senior director of industry affairs for the Indiana Soybean Alliance and Indiana Corn Growers Association, supports these insurance programs. He said that many Indiana soybean and corn farmers are projecting lower prices for their crops, so the extra support is important.\n\n\"Not that it's all gloom and doom, but that is a reality that we're facing, and that's one reason we've been advocating to get a farm bill passed with additional safety net provisions or enhanced safety net provisions for our farmers,\" Howell told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.\n\nAs part of the bill's Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage programs, farmers can receive financial support during periods of low market prices. Essentially, farmers can receive payments to augment lost revenue if the market prices of their commodities drop below reference prices set by the farm bill. The House's farm bill increases the statutory reference price for corn from $3.70 per bushel to $4.10, and for soybeans from $8.40 to $10.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of Indiana corn per bushel in May 2024 decreased by $1.89 from May 2023, and the price of soybeans decreased by $2.60. The cost of producing the crops has also increased since 2021, according to Purdue University's Center for Commercial Agriculture.\n\nTodd Davis, chief economist for the INFB, said in an email statement a new farm bill that increases baseline funding for crop insurance would make these safety nets for farmers more affordable.\n\n\"The combination of declining prices with increasing costs has created a profitability environment where farmers are experiencing very tight, or negative, returns over production costs,\" Davis said. \"Farmers protect revenue risk by purchasing crop insurance.\"\n\nHowell also sees the bill's funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Market Development program as a benefit for Indiana's agriculture markets. He said Indiana farmers have already been able to sell their crops in South Korea and China, and the funding could help them expand markets in Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico.\n\n\"We continue to produce sustainably a lot of corn and soybeans in Indiana, and we just need to continue to look for domestic markets as well as foreign markets,\" Howell said. \"We see a lot of opportunity to sell corn and soybeans overseas.\"\n\nSeveral Democratic Congressmembers, including Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, have criticized the bill for limiting future updates to the formula used to calculate SNAP benefits. However, the proposed bill would allow low-income Americans who have drug conviction felonies to obtain SNAP benefits -- something not allowed for under the 2018 legislation.\n\nAccording to the state Division of Family Resources, almost 287,500 Indiana households received SNAP benefits in May 2024.\n\nThe House version of the bill would also remove \"climate sideboards\" for conservation projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) dollars. Under the new bill, agencies could use these dollars to support conservation efforts that aren't grounded in combating climate change. It would also reallocate all unobligated IRA funding to established, locally-led conservation programs, and invests IRA dollars to create several new conservation programs.\n\nBoritt said the lack of these climate-oriented requirements should not stop the bill from passing. He said the Indiana Wildlife Federation's top priority for the farm bill was to get permanent baseline funding for conservation efforts. While the House bill removed the climate requirements, it does permanently move IRA funding to these conservation efforts.\n\n\"I fully acknowledge that there are concerns about the lack of climate sideboards, but the billions of dollars that have been brought into the baseline of the Farm Bill, I think are a huge, huge win for Indiana,\" Boritt said.\n\nHe also said that nearly 1.3 million acres of land in Indiana was protected under the 2018 Farm Bill, which funded the U.S. Farm Service Agency's Conservation Reserve Program. This program pays farmers to keep environmentally sensitive lands -- like lands with riparian buffers, grassed waterways and trees -- out of agricultural production. He said the farm bill is \"truly a game changer.\"\n\n\"In a state like Indiana, it is without question, the most important conservation funding dollars we receive,\" Boritt said. \"The Farm Bill is of the utmost importance, and I'll say that a million times, but it is truly the biggest driver of conservation in our state.\"", "source": {"uri": "ballstatedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Partisan gridlock in Congress has led to a stalemate on the current farm bill, which provides crop subsidies and nutrition assistance. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- The stalemate over the current farm bill may be solidifying a new era in farm politics as it joins the last three farm bills in a trend of delays and partisan division -- a contrast from the legislation's history of bipartisanship.\n\nEvery five years, Congress is tasked with drafting a new federal farm bill. The omnibus law that began 90 years ago as various kinds of payments to support farmers now has an impact far beyond the farm, with programs to create wildlife habitat, address climate change and provide the nation's largest federal nutrition program.\n\nThe current farm bill process, already nearly a year behind schedule, is at an impasse as Democrats and Republicans clash over how to pay for the bill and whether to place limits on nutrition and climate programs. The previous farm bill expired in September 2023 and has been extended through the end of this September.\n\nHistorically, farm bills were completed within a few months of their expiration date. Ten of the 13 farm bills since 1965 were enacted by December 31 in the year of their expirations. But three of the four farm bills since 2008 went beyond that date.\n\nThe last three bills - including the 2018 bill, which is the one recent version that passed on time - each had partisan disagreements about spending.\n\nThe trend represents a change in how the once-bipartisan legislation is viewed.\n\n\"The last two farm bills were the anomaly,\" said Jonathan Coppess, a professor of Agricultural Law and Policy at the University of Illinois who has written a history of the farm bill. \"Now that it has been three in a row, I'm not sure that holds.\"\n\nA recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service notes that starting in 2008, farm bills have been subject to delays, vetoes and insufficient votes to pass on the floor.\n\nThe report concluded: \"Over time, farm bills have tended to become more complicated and politically sensitive. As a result, the timeline for reauthorization has become less certain.\"\n\nThat uncertainty is true of the current farm bill, as Republicans in the House and Senate push for spending limits that Democrats say are non-starters.\n\n\"I don't think we're close to getting a farm bill done until the folks who are negotiating the farm bill are realistic about what's doable within a constrained resource environment,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in an interview on the radio program AgriTalk June 21.\n\nWhat was our biggest issue back in the four farm bills that I wrote was not Republican versus Democrat. It was usually Midwest against the Southeast or the Northeast or the Southwest from a crop standpoint.\n\n- former Senator Saxby Chambliss\n\nThe Republican-led House Agriculture Committee approved its farm bill proposal largely on party lines at the end of May, after hours of debate and complaints from Democrats that the process had not been as bipartisan as in years past.\n\nFour Democrats voted for the bill in committee, but they joined 20 other Democrats on the committee in a \"dissenting views\" letter expressing \"genuine concern over the trajectory of the Majority's partisan farm bill\" - which they predicted would be stuck in delay and dysfunction without significant changes.\n\nThe Senate Agriculture Committee has yet to vote. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the committee have each put forward contrasting bills and expressed their frustration.\n\nSenate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who is retiring after this term, has called the process the \"most frustrating\" of her career and said she would not let the Republican approach for the farm bill be her legacy.\n\n\"I've actually been involved in six farm bills and led on three of them, and this has been the most frustrating time,\" said Stabenow in an interview with Michigan Advance at the end of June. \"Because it's so much more partisan than usual and particularly around food assistance.\"\n\nPartisan division is not uncommon in today's Congress but is notable on the farm bill, which had historically brought together lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. Bipartisan support can be necessary for final passage because the size of the $1.5 trillion farm bill means it inevitably loses some votes from fiscal conservatives and others.\n\n\"If you don't have a bipartisan bill, this is not going to happen, and that is no matter who's in charge. The margins are too close to be able to get this done without bipartisan support,\" said Collin Peterson, a former Democratic House member from Minnesota and Agriculture Committee Chairman.\n\nThe key dispute for Democrats this year is a funding calculation that would place limits on the \"Thrifty Food Plan\" formula that calculates benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP.\n\nRepublicans are using the limits to offset other spending in the bill on crop subsidies. The top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, said he wants to put \"more farm in the farm bill.\"\n\nPeterson, who is now the head of an eponymous consulting firm, said in an interview with States Newsroom that Republicans would likely have to make changes to the nutrition title to get a bill to final passage.\n\n\"It is unrealistic to think they are going to get this done without significant changes in that part of the bill,\" he said.\n\nThe nutrition program that is at the center of the impasse was added to the legislation 50 years ago to help build a coalition of wide-ranging bipartisan support.\n\nLawmakers added the nutrition title to the farm bill in 1973, a move that widened the vested interest in the bill in the House. Lawmakers who wanted to increase payments for cotton and wheat farmers in their districts were able to bring in support from representatives from districts whose citizens could benefit from food aid.\n\n\"That was the first coalition building between the two interests,\" Coppess said. \"But it was pretty intense. And it was an uneasy alliance from the start.\"\n\nSince then, the farm bill in many ways has become a food bill. Three-quarters of the mandatory spending in the bill falls under the nutrition title, which includes SNAP, the largest U.S. program that addresses hunger.\n\nThe program, formerly called food stamps, supplements food budgets for low-income households. Anti-hunger groups have joined the outside interests pushing for the bill every five years.\n\nBut with such a large funding line, the nutrition program has become a target for Republicans who want to cut it to offset other spending in the bill.\n\n\"The dispute is all the pay-fors,\" Peterson said. \"And that has been the issue for the last three farm bills and issue on this one as well.\"\n\nPeterson, who was chairman of the House Agriculture Committee for the 2008 farm bill and was the top Democrat on the committee for the 2013 and 2018 bills, said partisan division on the committee is not unfamiliar at this phase of the process.\n\nThe farm bills he worked on also had partisan votes in the House but eventually found support from both sides after conferencing with the Senate.\n\n\"At the end of the day, every one of those bills was partisan, until we got through the conference committee, and then at that point it was bipartisan, because the Senate brought some of that to the table,\" Peterson said. \"So, kind of, what's going on here went on the last three farm bills.\"\n\nThe most recent farm bill in 2018 was marked by contentious partisan debate centered on SNAP's work requirements and other eligibility rules.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee's bill that year initially failed on the House floor and later squeaked through on a 213-211 vote. Twenty Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against that bill.\n\nAfter reconciling with the Senate bill and the removal of some of the contentious changes to SNAP, most Democrats flipped their votes in support and the House agreed to the final conference report in a bipartisan vote of 369-47. The dissenting votes included 44 Republicans and three Democrats.\n\nThe partisan division over the nutrition title creates new fault lines for the farm bill.\n\nHistorically, farm bill alliances were more regional than partisan. They were built on a common ground of support for shared crops or producers: cotton in the South, corn in the Midwest and wheat in the Western Plains.\n\n\"What was our biggest issue back in the four farm bills that I wrote was not Republican versus Democrat. It was usually Midwest against the Southeast or the Northeast or the Southwest from a crop standpoint,\" former Senator Saxby Chambliss said in an interview.\n\nChambliss, a Republican from Georgia, was on the House Agriculture Committee from 1995 to 2002 and the Senate Agriculture Committee 2005 to 2011, which included a stint as chairman and ranking member.\n\n\"There's a different political dynamic that exists in the Senate today that did not exist when I was there,\" Chambliss said. \"How much of that bleeds into the farm bill? I don't know the answer to that, but obviously it's a little more acrimonious than what I ever experienced.\"\n\nAs partisan politics have become more entrenched in regions of the country, with the South becoming more closely aligned with the Republican Party, it has played out in farm-bill politics.\n\n\"You see a staunch realignment around where the regional and the partisan are now very similar,\" said Coppess.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Indian_agriculture_acts",

While many of the policies will impact the state's 94,000 farmers, the farm bill can also influence food supply, conservation efforts and food-assistance benefits for Hoosiers.\n\nCongress usually reauthorizes a federal farm bill every five years. The current farm bill, which former President Donald Trump signed in December 2018, was supposed to expire in 2023, but was extended through Sept. 30, 2024. The legislation funds programs in 12 different areas including crop insurance, nutrition and rural development.\n\nPartisan division, however, has delayed the bill process, which is nearly a year behind schedule.\n\nBrantley Seifers, national affairs director for the Indiana Farm Bureau, said his organization's main concern with the bill is making sure it gets approved this year.\n\n\"We've put a lot of work into this farm bill. Our members have been advocating for this farm bill for the better part of two years now,\" Seifers told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. \"Making sure it gets done in this Congress and we don't settle with a further extension is going to be very important.\"\n\nIf Congress does not pass the federal farm bill by September, operations for some programs will stop completely or receive significantly less funding. Some programs supported by the bill -- including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and federal crop insurance -- can still be funded, however, by government appropriations.\n\nDan Boritt, executive director for the Indiana Wildlife Federation, also emphasized the importance of passing the legislation in 2024.\n\n\"If we aren't able to come to an agreement on a farm bill, it would be catastrophic for conservation in the state of Indiana, and the entire country, frankly,\" he said. \"Agriculture is a really, really, really difficult industry to be financially successful in and these dollars allow (farmers) to take those risks, to do good things on the land that benefit all of us.\"\n\nSafety nets for Indiana farmers\n\nThe proposed House bill increases funding for specialty crops research, expands eligibility for disaster assistance, broadens safety net programs for farmers and encourages farmers to sell their products abroad, among other programs.\n\nSeifers said he views the 2018 Farm Bill as a strong piece of legislation, which just needs tweaking. He said many of the INFB's priorities were included in the House's version of the bill.\n\n\"We're not looking for huge changes in that farm bill, but we are looking for updates to that farm bill,\" Seifers said. \"\"You look at some portions of the bill that haven't been updated in a number of years, like the market access program and foreign market development program, both of those are still stagnant at 20 year levels.\"\n\nPart of the $1.5 trillion bill would support safety net programs and crop insurance for farmers. Seifers said Indiana farmers can recover from flooding and other disasters with this funding.\n\n\"If you go to a bank for a loan on the farm, their first question is going to be 'what's your crop insurance,'\" Seifers said. \"Having that in place and having that be strong for our members, and flexible, is going to allow them to keep working.\"\n\nSteve Howell, senior director of industry affairs for the Indiana Soybean Alliance and Indiana Corn Growers Association, supports these insurance programs. He said many Indiana soybean and corn farmers are projecting lower prices for their crops, so the extra support is important.\n\n\"Not that it's all gloom and doom, but that is a reality that we're facing, and that's one reason we've been advocating to get a farm bill passed with additional safety net provisions or enhanced safety net provisions for our farmers,\" Howell said.\n\nAs part of the bill's Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage programs, farmers can receive financial support during periods of low market prices. Essentially, farmers can receive payments to augment lost revenue if the market prices of their commodities drop below reference prices set by the farm bill. The House's farm bill increases the statutory reference price for corn from $3.70 per bushel to $4.10, and for soybeans from $8.40 to $10.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of Indiana corn per bushel in May 2024 decreased by $1.89 from May 2023, and the price of soybeans decreased by $2.60. The cost of producing the crops has also increased since 2021, according to Purdue University's Center for Commercial Agriculture.\n\nTodd Davis, chief economist for the INFB, said in an email statement a new farm bill that increases baseline funding for crop insurance would make these safety nets for farmers more affordable.\n\n\"The combination of declining prices with increasing costs has created a profitability environment where farmers are experiencing very tight, or negative, returns over production costs,\" Davis said. \"Farmers protect revenue risk by purchasing crop insurance.\"\n\nHowell also sees the bill's funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Market Development program as a benefit for Indiana's agriculture markets. He said Indiana farmers have already been able to sell their crops in South Korea and China, and the funding could help them expand markets in Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico.\n\n\"We continue to produce sustainably a lot of corn and soybeans in Indiana, and we just need to continue to look for domestic markets as well as foreign markets,\" Howell said. \"We see a lot of opportunity to sell corn and soybeans overseas.\"\n\nSeveral Democratic Congressmembers, including Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, have criticized the bill for limiting future updates to the formula used to calculate SNAP benefits. However, the proposed bill would allow low-income Americans who have drug conviction felonies to obtain SNAP benefits -- something not allowed for under the 2018 legislation.\n\nAccording to the state Division of Family Resources, almost 287,500 Indiana households received SNAP benefits in May 2024.\n\nConservation funding\n\nThe House version of the bill also would remove \"climate sideboards\" for conservation projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) dollars. Under the new bill, agencies could use these dollars to support conservation efforts that aren't grounded in combating climate change. It would also reallocate all unobligated IRA funding to established, locally-led conservation programs, and invests IRA dollars to create several new conservation programs.\n\nBoritt said the lack of these climate-oriented requirements should not stop the bill from passing. He said the Indiana Wildlife Federation's top priority for the farm bill was to get permanent baseline funding for conservation efforts. While the House bill removed the climate requirements, it does permanently move IRA funding to these conservation efforts.\n\n\"I fully acknowledge that there are concerns about the lack of climate sideboards, but the billions of dollars that have been brought into the baseline of the Farm Bill, I think are a huge, huge win for Indiana,\" Boritt said.\n\nHe also said that nearly 1.3 million acres of land in Indiana was protected under the 2018 Farm Bill, which funded the U.S. Farm Service Agency's Conservation Reserve Program. This program pays farmers to keep environmentally sensitive lands -- like lands with riparian buffers, grassed waterways and trees -- out of agricultural production. He said the farm bill is \"truly a game changer.\"\n\n\"In a state like Indiana, it is without question, the most important conservation funding dollars we receive,\" Boritt said. \"The Farm Bill is of the utmost importance, and I'll say that a million times, but it is truly the biggest driver of conservation in our state.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

My feeling is Speaker Johnson won't bring this bill to the floor for a vote, because it wasn't written as a serious bill.

Thompson told Scott \"there's a lot I could say, but I'm not going to say anything.\"\n\nThe House Ag Committee's farm bill passed out of committee in late May on a slight bipartisan vote.

Consider the ongoing stalemate involving the $1.5 trillion farm bill.\n\nHouse Republicans have passed an update to the 2018 farm bill that scales back food assistance programs while expanding subsidies to agricultural producers. Democrats control the Senate and prefer a version that does the opposite. The two sides are not close to a compromise, so they may put off action until after the election, The Washington Post reports. The current bill -- already extended a year -- is set to expire Sept. 30.\n\nUnfortunately, there's precious little debate among either Democrats or Republicans about crafting an omnibus agriculture package with an eye toward eliminating waste, reining in handouts and promoting self-sufficiency. In fact, the farm bill is a microcosm of the congressional profligacy that has led to soaring deficits and a $34 trillion national debt that threatens the nation's financial solvency.\n\nAccording to Taxpayers for Common Sense, the 2018 farm bill will run a half a trillion dollars over budget. Yet Congress appears poised to simply roll it over again rather than dig into the details on behalf of the American taxpayer.\n\n\"Group after group of farm lobbyists instead has its handout,\" the watchdog group reports, \"asking Congress for a laundry list of ways to increase federal spending and government involvement in certain commodity crop markets.\"\n\nIn addition, Democrats insist on retaining looser -- and costly -- pandemic-era eligibility requirements for food assistance programs.\n\nA fiscally prudent approach would encourage both farmers and able-bodied welfare recipients to wean themselves off the taxpayer handouts.\n\n\"Last year, U.S. net farm income set a new record,\" Taxpayers for Common Sense notes. \"Meanwhile, government payments to agriculture reached their highest level in 2020, making up nearly half of farm income. While some agricultural producers rely heavily on government subsidies each year, other farmers successfully grow their businesses with little to no subsidies at all.\"\n\nIndeed, why do producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice or peanuts merit a government check when prices fall, while farmers dealing in fruits, most vegetables or livestock receive no such largess?\n\nFarm subsidies date to the 1930s, when collectivism and central planning dominated congressional and presidential policymaking. Republicans have, with varying degrees of success, made efforts in the past to curtail handouts to various farm interests. If they truly want to distinguish themselves from the free-spending Democrats, they should revive that approach as the current farm bill debate progresses.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_Improvement_Act_of_2018", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_farm_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States farm bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxpayers_for_Common_Sense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taxpayers for Common Sense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Planned economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peanut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soybean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/19373597_web1_money-more.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718465", "eventUri": "eng-9718465", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 633, "textEnd": 641}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

I like to say that they've used Harry Potter's visibility cloak to essentially cloak over what I think CBO says is at least a $30 billion deficit. That's a very large number, and they've got to get reasonable and practical about this if they're truly interested in getting the farm bill done.\"\n\nVilsack says farmers have a right to expect to get it done, even though there are major differences of opinion on issues such as the level of nutrition assistance that should be provided to low income families and the level of assistance that farmers should be receiving.\n\n\"So I think farmers expect policy workers to work from a practical perspective. I think they expect that there be a reasonable commitment to trying to address some of the challenges that we have in the countryside. And I think they expect the work to get done.\"\n\nBut once again, lawmakers are up against another time crunch. The current one year Farm Bill extension runs out, September 30.\n\n\"My hope is, and I'm committed to working with both houses Senate try to see this done for the expiration of the existing extension. After all, we are more than a year delayed in getting this done. I hope is that we wouldn't have to have an extension. But obviously, if September 30 comes and goes and we haven't got a farm bill passed at that point, it would be appropriate for the Congress to pass an extension to give them sufficient time, hopefully before the end of the year, to get this farm bill passed.\"\n\nVilsack says passing a farm bill is never an easy process, but it's even more difficult during an election year.", "source": {"uri": "sfntoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFNToday"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_davis@sfntoday.com", "name": "Mike Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vilsack", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Vilsack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_farm_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States farm bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Budget Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable_Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable Agriculture", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Associations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://cdn.socast.io/3922/sites/37/2024/02/16161419/Shutterstock_FARM-BILL.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718465", "eventUri": "eng-9718465", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 1678, "textEnd": 1690, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

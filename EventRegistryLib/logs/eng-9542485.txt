The roster looks quite good -- on paper.\n\nBut one major question remains for the Steelers, one that won't be answered until the actual games get underway. How much will the passing game provide the offense under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and new starting quarterback Russell Wilson?\n\nThe Athletic's Mike DeFabo has that question for the Steelers in a piece Monday morning looking at the outlook of Pittsburgh following the draft. That makes sense considering the Steelers seemingly aced the draft, addressing the offensive line in a major way, adding another passing-game weapon to the receiver room, and building a draft class that matches the personality and play style Pittsburgh wants.\n\n\"The Steelers' highly compensated and opportunistic defense lugged an anemic and dysfunctional offense into the postseason last year, even with Kenny Pickett's inconsistencies and Matt Canada's incompetence. This offseason, Pittsburgh has focused extensively on upgrading the offense,\" DeFabo writes, according to theathletic.com. \"By bulking up on the offensive line during the draft, the Steelers should have a reliable running game that takes the pressure off of the quarterback and keeps him upright.\n\n\"Now the question is how much Russell Wilson -- with his trademark deep ball and effective play-action passing -- can add a spark through the air.\"\n\nAs DeFabo pointed out, the Steelers' passing game last season -- until the final three weeks of the year with Mason Rudolph under center -- was a mess. Kenny Pickett took a major step backwards in his second season and never really took off like many believed he would, especially after a great preseason.\n\nFormer offensive coordinator Matt Canada dragged down the offense overall with his scheme and play-calling struggles, and the defense had to step up time and time again, helping the Steelers win low-scoring affairs. While that play style matched what the Steelers wanted, which was limiting turnovers and mistakes offensively, leaning on a star-studded defense and winning low-scoring games, the way they were doing it was unsustainable.\n\nSo, they went to work this offseason on that side of the ball. In comes Arthur Smith as the coordinator, Wilson and Justin Fields at quarterback, and plenty of side and attitude added to the offensive line. Though the Steelers traded wide receiver Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers, creating a major hole at receiver, they have largely upgraded everywhere else on offense.\n\nThat's quite encouraging.\n\nNow, it will be up to Wilson to give the Steelers that spark in the passing game, providing a balance to the ground-and-pound style the Steelers are undoubtedly going to play moving forward, hammering away at defenses with a rebuilt offensive line featuring two rookies in Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier and a dynamic running back duo in Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren.\n\nIf Wilson can continue to hit some deep balls, play within the structure of Smith's scheme and get back to playing good football like he once did in a similar setup in Seattle, the Steelers could really be in business when it comes to competing for a Super Bowl.\n\nThe pieces, again on paper, are largely there after a whirlwind of an offseason. That's rather encouraging for the Steelers.\n\nRelated Items:Arthur Smith, Mike DeFabo, Pittsburgh Steelers, Russell Wilson, The Athletic, Trending Recommended for you Steelers Rookie Zach Frazier Explains The Keys To A Good Center-Quarterback Relationship Steelers Veterans Winners And Losers Of 2024 Offseason Kaboly: Russell Wilson Will Start All Of 2024 Barring Injury", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_carney@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Josh Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Smith_(American_football,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Smith (American football, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Canada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Rudolph_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mason Rudolph (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/StockRussellWilson12.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Pittsburgh signed Van Jefferson and Quez Watkins, but neither looks like a legitimate option to be the No. 2 wideout. Enter Roman Wilson, Pittsburgh's first of two third-round picks in the 2024 NFL Draft. Wilson could be a slot receiver for the Steelers, but even if the team adds a capable option on the outside, Wilson could still see work outside and end up as Pittsburgh's No. 2 wideout.\n\nOne of the things that's going to work against Wilson playing outside is his size. At the NFL Scouting Combine, he measured in at 5106 and 185 pounds, but coming out of Toledo in 2019, Johnson was 5104 and 183 pounds, and he worked out just fine as an outside receiver in Pittsburgh. Furthering the idea that I think Wilson could be utilized whether in the slot or the outside is Arthur Smith's comments about his versatility and being able to play inside or out as a rookie.\n\n\"He's got versatility. As the game's evolved and if you do motion and you play condensed on early downs, on the X to Z it's kind of interchangeable. Now you're getting into some of the drop-back situations in the passing downs, he's got inside-out flex, certainly you look his instincts, you can play inside on those kind of obvious pass situations. But he'll have a lot of versatility, he's got a lot of instincts, again, high football character guy,\" Smith said after the Steelers selected Wilson, via Steelers.com.\n\nWarren Sharp posted data the other day looking at the percentage of teams using three wide-receiver sets. Last season the Atlanta Falcons, the team Smith was previously the head coach of, had by far the fewest amount, as they used three receivers on just 18% of plays. The second-lowest team was the San Francisco 49ers at 39%.\n\nDave Bryan looked at Smith's wide receiver usage earlier this offseason to point out that the Steelers likely wouldn't make a big free agency addition. While that was before the trade of Johnson, it's not hard to fathom the team using Pickens and Wilson as their two primary receivers.\n\nThe Steelers still need to add another receiver. But the options available aren't all that exciting right now, with DJ Chark and Michael Gallup off the market and Tyler Boyd likely signing elsewhere. There still might be some releases, and with how aggressive the Steelers have been, it's impossible to rule out the team making a swing for a big-name receiver, and DK Metcalf could be an option. But the Steelers are going to get Wilson on the field, and the chances of him ending up as the second-most productive receiver on the team behind Pickens aren't as low as one might think.\n\nI do think Wilson is best suited for the slot, as that's where he has the most experience over the last two seasons and his most production came in the slot. But he'll move around a little bit for the Steelers, and he could be their second receiver on the field along with Pickens on the majority of downs even if they do add a bigger option more suited for the outside, which they should.\n\nBut Wilson could easily see a few snaps a game on the outside, and most of his routes run last season were deep crosses and out routes, as he ran 36 deep crosses and 33 out routes, per Sports Info Solutions. As a shifty outside receiver with speed, those two routes could open up the possibility for Wilson to make plays along the sideline or deep downfield and beat corners with his speed.\n\nI'll admit it's probably not the ideal situation, but with the market drying up, Wilson possibly functioning as the Steelers' No. 2 wideout is a real possibility. There's still plenty of time between now and Week 1 and the Steelers will likely still add another option at receiver, but Wilson just may end up being the team's most productive non-Pickens wideout in 2024.\n\nRelated Items:Arthur Smith, George Pickens, Omar Khan, Pittsburgh Steelers, Roman Wilson, Trending Recommended for you Steelers Named Team That 'Reignited Super Bowl Hopes' After Offseason Moves Steelers Had Eighth-Highest Rate Running Into Stacked Boxes In 2023 Carney: Steelers Way-Too-Early 53-Man Roster Prediction", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quez_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quez Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Chark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

The great draft that loaded up on offensive lineman.\n\n\"But man, what they did the first two rounds, getting a starting left tackle and a starting center who both are like perfect scheme fits from how they can move, Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier for the offense line. And then even further down the board, Mason McCormick I like a lot too, was like my favorite developmental guard in this draft class.\"\n\nThe Steelers landed some \"ass kickers\" up front in Troy Fautanu, Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick, as offensive line coach Pat Meyer said following the selection of McCormick. The trio give the Steelers a real nasty edge to the position group, which is something they're really going to need moving forward as they aim to play a smash mouth style of football under Smith, much like the Tennessee Titans played during his three years as offensive coordinator there from 2018-20.\n\nComing into the 2024 NFL Draft, the offensive line was a group that the Steelers needed to address, period. They did that in a major way with three offensive line selections in the first five picks, doing something the Steelers' organization hadn't done since the 1976 NFL Draft.\n\nIn the process, the Steelers built up in the trenches and gave Smith exactly what he was looking for.\n\nWith the additions in the trenches, Smith can now run the ball at will with Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, and build up the play-action passing game with Russell Wilson or Justin Fields, depending on who is ultimately under center.\n\nThat's how the Steelers leaned all in on Smith's scheme and style. Is that always wise to be leaning all in from a roster building standpoint on an offensive coordinator who might not be in the organization long-term? Probably not, but Smith's scheme and style is in lock-step with what the Steelers want and envision, so it all works out in the end.\n\nHopefully it leads to great success on the field, too.\n\nRelated Items:Arthur Smith, Mike Renner, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pro Football Focus, Trending Recommended for you Albert Breer Confused By Analysts Wanting Steelers To Trade For Big-Name WR: 'Never Been' What They Do Eagles Signing Shon Stephens, Joey Porter Jr.'s Cousin Won't Attend Steelers Minicamp Churn Baby Churn: Steelers Nearly Top NFL In Roster Turnover", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_carney@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Josh Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Smith_(American_football,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Smith (American football, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Meyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Position coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Porter_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Arthur-Smith-Presser-Stock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Gone is former first-round pick Kenny Pickett and the much-maligned offensive coordinator Matt Canada. Polarizing receiver Diontae Johnson is now a Carolina Panther. Former Falcons head coach Arthur Smith is now running the Steelers offense. Five draft picks and over $40 million have been invested into the offensive line.\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what Khan's vision for this team is. He was a part of the organization when they returned to their Super Bowl level of play, and those teams were built on the backs of a strong running game and dominant defense. Ever since he took the reigns from long-time GM Kevin Colbert. he has wasted no time chasing that blueprint.\n\nThis is still the modern NFL, however, so will the Steelers be able to execute his plans; or will his attempt to revive the past fall short?\n\nSteelers looking to run away from the competition\n\nSteelers fans have suffered through years of offensive mediocrity after the high-flying offenses of the mid-2010s fell apart, but there may be light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Arthur Smith may have failed to perform as coach of the Atlanta Falcons, but his stint as the Tennessee Titans OC was very successful. The Titans finished top 10 in points scored in both of his seasons running the offense, as well as top three in rushing offense.\n\nOmar Khan has provided Smith with an incredibly talented offensive line, including new additions Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier with their first two draft picks this year. Add in athletic guard/center Mason McCormick, and the Steelers offensive line should be set for years to come.\n\nThe Steelers have tried to establish a strong running game for the last few years, but the overall success rate just hasn't been there. Now, the pieces are in place to change that.\n\nAll of that is great, but the question now is whether that direction is the correct one. The NFL is still a passing league at the end of the day, and the Steelers passing offense has a lot of questions to put it nicely.\n\nOne of Russell Wilson or Justin Fields could be the answer at QB, but it's more likely that neither is the guy. Drafting Michigan receiver Roman Wilson was a nice addition, but it's George Pickens against the world outside of him.\n\nSteelers floor is set, but what about their ceiling?\n\nI believe Khan is trying to do everything he can to make the Steelers' questionable QB situation less of a concern. That makes plenty of sense for a team that is always in win-now mode, but it's fair to wonder what the ceiling of this roster is.\n\nIt's hard to argue with building up the trenches the way he has, and it will ultimately help whoever the long-term QB is. Still, relying on your run game and defense may not be enough to get you into the playoffs, or at least not very far if you do make it.\n\nOverall, I think the Steelers are equipped to finally be the hard-nosed, physical offense that Khan has been striving for this season. Arthur Smith should be able to get their run game going behind this rebuilt line, and hopefully one of their new QBs can at least do the easy stuff well.\n\nIf so, the Steelers could finally push beyond being a fringe playoff team in 2024. If not, it could be back to the drawing board on offense in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "stillcurtain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Still Curtain"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khan_(administrator)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omar Khan (administrator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Smith_(American_football,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Smith (American football, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Canada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Colbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Colbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4800,h_2700,x_0,y_115/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/58/01hwzk2j8t2v8bk7axmd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

That would be the wide receiver position, particularly a strong No. 2 opposite George Pickens.\n\nThough the Steelers came away with Michigan's Roman Wilson at No. 84 overall in the third round, giving the Steelers a receiver they've coveted throughout the pre-draft process, Pittsburgh still needs to do more behind Pickens and Wilson.\n\nVeterans Van Jefferson and Quez Watkins, as well as third-year pro Calvin Austin III and Reserve/Futures wide receiver Marquez Callaway are certainly fine pieces to have, but they aren't exactly needle movers at the position, which has led to the Steelers being tied to speculation regarding trades for San Francisco's Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel, Seattle's DK Metcalf, and Denver's Courtland Sutton.\n\nNothing has happened to this point though, but GM Omar Khan did state that conversations are continuing regarding the Steelers and any potential trade, whether that's at receiver or elsewhere.\n\nBut for Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, he doesn't understand the call for the Steelers to trade for a big-name receiver. In a piece for SI.com regarding his takeaways from the past week, Breer pushed back on the conversation that the Steelers need to trade for a big-name receiver.\n\n\"I still don't get the people who are so into the Pittsburgh Steelers trading for a big-name veteran receiver. It's never been Pittsburgh's m.o. to do something like that at that particular position,\" Breer writes regarding the Steelers and the need to trade for a big-name receiver. \"And I can't imagine trading [Diontae] Johnson is some sort of big needle-mover in this regard, either.\n\n\"Pittsburgh's drafted 19 receivers over the last 18 draft cycles. The highest pick spent in the bunch was on Chase Claypool, who went 49th in 2020. Yet, without spending more than that on the position, they've wound up with Antonio Brown, Emmanuel Sanders, Mike Wallace, Martavis Bryant, JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington, George Pickens, Johnson and Claypool, all of whom wound up producing to varying degrees for the team.\"\n\nThat's a pretty impressive haul considering none of those guys were drafted higher than No. 49 overall.\n\nThe Steelers certainly know what they're doing when it comes to identifying and targeting receivers in the draft. Just look at that list of names again at the position. That's quite impressive.\n\nWilson could the next name in that group. But that doesn't mean the Steelers don't need to add to the position group. Pickens, Wilson, Jefferson and some combination of Watkins, Austin and Callaway simply isn't good enough, even in a run-heavy offense that new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will bring to the table.\n\nThe Steelers have to add, whether that's adding a veteran in free agency like a Marquez Valdez-Scantling, bringing back Allen Robinson II, or going out and trading for a receiver. It might not be their M.O. in the past, but it's a new day and age with Omar Khan in charge.\n\nBreer doesn't buy it though.\n\n\"On top of that [draft success], the last time the Steelers' leading receiver wasn't homegrown was in the year the United States entered World War II -- 1941 (Don Looney, if you're scoring at home). And over the years, Pittsburgh has been able to replace guys such as Plaxico Burress, Wallace, Sanders and Brown as they've left the organization,\" Breer writes regarding the Steelers' wide receivers position. \"All of this history, of course, bodes well for the 84th pick in this year's draft, Roman Wilson.\n\n\"And probably not as well for those waiting on the Steelers to take some big swing on a vet.\"\n\nSure, the history is impressive. The Steelers have been able to churn out receivers time and time again, and have hit more often than not, even in a pass-happy style of football coming out of college that has infiltrated the NFL.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they shouldn't swing big, especially in a window currently where the Steelers are spending the veteran minimum on a starting quarterback in Russell Wilson and have a young offensive overall with a handful of players still on rookie deals on that side of the football.\n\nIt might not happen, because again, that's not their exact modus operandi, as Breer points out. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered and pushed for. That could be the move that puts the Steelers over the top, taking some pressure off of a rookie receiver to be Robin to Pickens' Batman right away the process.\n\nRelated Items:Albert Breer, George

On top of that, the Steelers addressed the trenches in the draft, bringing in three offensive linemen including first-round pick Troy Fautanu at offensive tackle and C Zach Frazier in the second round. Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski thinks the Steelers vaulted themselves back into Super Bowl contention, naming them one of five teams that reignited their Super Bowl hopes this offseason.\n\nSobleski gave the Steelers credit for moving on from Kenny Pickett after just two seasons.\n\n\"The Kenny Pickett first-round selection flopped. To Pittsburgh's credit, the organization didn't fall prey to the sunk-cost fallacy. Instead, general manager Omar Khan immediately pursued Russell Wilson after the Denver Broncos released the veteran quarterback. Khan doubled down at the game's most important position by flipping a conditional 2025 sixth-round draft pick to the Chicago Bears for Justin Fields.\"\n\nHe also believes that the Steelers did the most in the AFC North when it came to bettering their roster.\n\n\"The AFC North will be a dog fight this fall, especially with Joe Burrow and Deshaun Watson expected to be healthy. The Steelers have closed the most ground throughout this offseason, though.\"\n\nEven with three AFC North teams making the playoffs last season, the Steelers managed to go 5-1 against the division, although they did have the benefit of facing the Bengals twice without Joe Burrow and the Ravens without Lamar Jackson in Week 18. But their roster undoubtedly improved this offseason, and it needed to after sub-standard quarterback play for most of the season and depth being tested due to injuries on defense.\n\nAdding Wilson and moving on from Pickett was the first step, and Wilson represents an upgrade over what the Steelers had in the quarterback room last season. But adding Queen to the richest free-agent deal in team history helped give the defense another All-Pro and a true three-down linebacker that they've been lacking at the linebacker position for years. By addressing the trenches in the draft, the Steelers improve their line in the short-and-long-term as they look to become a more physical team under Arthur Smith, who the team brought in as their offensive coordinator this offseason.\n\nThe Steelers are in win-now mode and have admitted as much, and Art Rooney II said the front office is getting impatient with not having won a playoff game, a feat the Steelers haven't accomplished since 2016. It's been far too long since the Steelers have experienced playoff success, and the moves they've made this offseason reflect that they're ready to win.\n\nWith upgrades across the board, the bare minimum expectation for the Steelers should be to win a playoff game, even in a loaded AFC. While they might not quite be on the level of Super Bowl contenders like Sobleski has them, they're a good enough team to advance when the games count in January, and if that doesn't happen, the season will be a disappointment.\n\nRelated Items:", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Rooney_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Art Rooney II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Russell-Wilson-Mike-Tomlin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

While he fits the Steelers profile, it's fair to question the value they're getting. They passed on Adonai Mitchell to take C Zach Frazier the previous round. Much of the value at wide receiver came off the board in between those two selections.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint Wilson's ceiling as his career evolves, but right now the Steelers are set to put quite a lot on his plate. Outside of George Pickens, they don't have any notable names in the room. Calvin Ausitn III carries over from last season, while they added veterans Van Jefferson and Quez Watkins in March.\n\nRay Fittipaldo questions the wisdom of doing that, if indeed the Steelers move into 2024 with Roman Wilson starting. He never even had an 800-yard season during his four-year college career, though he scored 12 times in 2023.\n\n\"I think he's gonna be a good player\", Fittipaldo said of Wilson on the North Shore Drive podcast last week. \"I think in time he can be a number two receiver in the NFL. but why do you want to put that responsibility on his shoulders as a rookie? To me that would be a little bit unfair. I think that's why there's a lot of speculation right now about a move being made\".\n\nThat speculation, of course, never materialized into anything concrete, and at this point, it probably won't. The Steelers reportedly engaged at least the San Francisco 49ers in trade talks for Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel. They obviously passed, however, and opted to draft Roman Wilson in the third round.\n\nBut is Wilson your WR2 behind George Pickens from his first day in the NFL? How feasible is that in Arthur Smith's offense? It's hard to gauge how much the second receiver will even do. I know we have a lot pf preconceived notions about his \"system\", but he's only coordinated two offenses. He threw the ball around the one year he had Matt Ryan at quarterback, and both A.J. Brown and Cory Davis produced at wide receiver in another.\n\nThe Steelers rebuilt their offensive line, however, which is an asset to any plans they may have. And Wilson's willingness to block will afford him playing time on running downs in addition to passing situations.\n\nFilm Room: WR Roman Wilson Epitomizes 'No Block, No Rock' Mentality\n\nStill, if they can manage to bring in a veteran who is worthy of being on the field, perhaps that's best for Wilson. Is he ready to play 50-plus snaps per game right now, or is he better served having time to develop? The Steelers have rushed rookies when they needed to, with mixed results, but they prefer them to develop over time.\n\nRelated Items:North Shore Drive, Pittsburgh Steelers, Ray Fittipaldo, Roman Wilson, Trending Recommended for you Kaboly: 'Takes A Lot Of Diving Through The Muck' To Find Jaylen Warrens Without Early Draft Picks At RB Set It, Forget It - What Pittsburgh Missed Out By Declining Najee Harris' Option To Make The Hall Of Fame, Cam Heyward's Magic Number Might Be 90", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quez_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quez Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.

Wilson, a wide receiver, joined the Pittsburgh Steelers as a third-round draft pick late last month.\n\nHe was the leading receiver for the undefeated national champions, he proved clutch on the biggest of college stages, and he ran the 40-yard dash in less than 4.4 seconds at the NFL combine.\n\nSo, how did Roman Wilson last until the 14 wide receiver selected in the draft, and how did the Pittsburgh Steelers manage to get him 84th overall?\n\nPart of what attracted the Steelers to Wilson, it turns out, was the lack of overall gaudy production.\n\nIndirectly, at least.\n\n\"What I saw was a great teammate,\" Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith said Wilson, the first of the team's two third-round picks. \"You know, everybody wants the ball and that's great. You want guys that want the ball. I have a problem with guys that don't want to work.\n\n\"So, the guys are good teammates and do that, you can get more possessions and extend drives. I think the tape shows a lot about your personality. People can say what they want, but you look at their actions and certainly Roman's pops off to the tape backs up when you meet them in person. We're just really excited to get him in our program.\"\n\nThough Wilson's 12 receiving touchdowns were bested by only eight players in the country in 2023, his other totals in the traditional statistics appear rather ordinary: 3.2 catches and 52.6 yards per game as a senior for Michigan.\n\nBut context illuminates. The Wolverines are among the few elite programs that has run a so-called \"pro-style\" offense. Its run-heavy lean was exacerbated by the team's dominance last season (big leads don't offer situational use for much passing).\n\nIf Wilson had played for a spread, quickly-moving, pass-first offense on a team that played in plenty of close games, who knows how many catches and yards he could have racked up?\n\nThe 1,000-yard season he never achieved? Wilson will gladly take the national championship ring instead.\n\n\"I think the most important thing I learned about winning is that I think winning is more important than anything you could ever do on the field,\" said Wilson, who had a tying touchdown with 1 minute, 34 seconds left of the College Football Playoff semifinal against Alabama on Jan 1. \"I feel like your main focus should just be winning instead of just trying to put up some crazy stat line. It just helped me focus on just winning and doing whatever I need to do to win a game. That was the biggest thing I learned at Michigan.\"\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 186-pound Wilson figures to have an opportunity to immediately contribute as a rookie after the Steelers traded Diontae Johnson, released Allen Robinson and allowed No. 5 WR Miles Boykin to depart in free agency.\n\nWilson joins a positional depth chart in which third-year George Pickens has inherited the WR1 designation but includes mostly question marks and journeymen beyond that.\n\nWilson spent a significant portion of his college career running routes out of the slot. The Steelers have no obvious other option there, so a prominent rookie gig for Wilson would appear to be there for the taking.\n\n\"He creates separation at break points, he's battle tested on the interior portions of the field. he comes from a winning program,\" coach Mike Tomlin said. \"You can' say enough about the winning component in terms of how it shapes the relationships with the game and what they're willing to do and their mettle. He checks a lot of those boxes.\"\n\nSmith touted that Wilson can excel on the outside in addition to from the slot and that the Steelers value his versatility.\n\nThe hiring of Smith, in simplistic terms, suggests the Steelers are seeking to trend their offense more toward how Michigan has operated in the Big Ten in recent seasons.\n\nAll the more reason for the Steelers to buy into that Wilson, well, will buy into what they intend on doing.\n\n\"I feel like if your mindset is to win a game,\" Wilson said, \"you're going to go out there and do whatever your coach asked you to do to help the team win.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_adamski@triblive.com", "name": "Chris Adamski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiesta_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiesta Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-style_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro-style offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Boykin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Boykin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/05/7317248_web1_5767669-de78775f0b5540e390536b9e58696b18.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 2371, "textEnd": 2376}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It seems like the most prudent thing to do with rookie minicamp at the end of the week and OTAs at the end of the month.\n\nIn this installment of the Pittsburgh Steelers mailbag, there was much concern about who the second receiver might be, why running back Najee Harris didn't get his fifth-year option picked up, offensive lineman Dan Moore Jr. getting traded and more.\n\nYou have questions, and I have answers -- that's how this thing works -- so let's get rolling.\n\nNote: Some questions have been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow do you think Harris will react to having his option declined? Is there a chance he'll sign an extension or is this the end of the road? -- Derreck S.\n\nIt's hard to say how he will react. I can see him taking it in stride, or I can see him making noise over it. You never know with him. I'm sure he feels disrespected, but it won't benefit him if he dwells on it. As for the extension, that's not going to happen. It's difficult to come up with a legitimate scenario in which he comes back next year. If he puts up another good year, he'll test free agency and get paid a decent salary. If he doesn't produce this year, why would you want him back? That's what you have to consider when you decide not to pick up the fifth-year option.\n\nAre the Steelers' offensive woes of the past few years solved? If the answer is no, what is the main culprit and the long-term solution? -- Jamaal M.\n\nI don't know if I would use the word \"solved.\" The offense is in a better place than it was a year ago, but that doesn't rubber-stamp success. A lot will have to come together for it to be a much better offense than it was over the past two years. But that's all you can ask for. This game is an inexact science. You think you know, but you don't. I will say this: If they fail again this year, it'll be because of poor quarterback play, but you can say that about any NFL team.\n\nWhat are the chances the Steelers move on from George Pickens when his contract is up if they somehow land a star receiver like Deebo Samuel, who already has a big contract? -- Doug Y.\n\nA lot will depend on what Pickens does this year. First, I don't expect the Steelers to acquire Samuel. Second, if Pickens doesn't make that jump from being a good receiver with unlimited potential to a top playmaker, then they probably wouldn't want to invest in another contract with him. Remember, the only Steelers receivers who have secured second contracts were Hines Ward, Antonio Brown and Diontae Johnson -- with the most recent one being the wrong decision.\n\nDoes some of the difficulty in acquiring a bona fide star WR have to do with trouble in restructuring contracts? -- David S.\n\nNo. They have plenty of money to spend if they want to. They've been restructuring contracts for close to two decades now, and the only time it bit them was when the pandemic severely altered the salary cap. The Steelers need and want a high-end receiver, but you can't sell the farm to accomplish it. Sure, you can overpay, but only to a degree.\n\nWhich WR do you see the Steelers most likely trading for? -- Ricky G.\n\nI don't know if it would be as lucrative as Love's extension of $13 million guaranteed, but maybe it's something in that neighborhood. The Steelers have to ensure they have Fields around for another year but at a price that makes sense. General manager Omar Khan will have to be creative, and to be honest, Fields is going to have to want to come back to make it happen. I guess the question is: With Russell Wilson in tow for a year or two or three, why would Fields want to come back?\n\nIs this team a good QB away from being a Super Bowl contender? -- Curtis S.\n\nYou can probably say that about the 18 teams that don't make the playoffs every year. Also, Wilson could be good; he might not have to be great. A good roster fit might be all it takes.\n\nIf the Steelers offered the Seattle Seahawks Calvin Austin III and a 2025 third-round pick for DK Metcalf (to be executed June 1), would it be a reasonable offer? -- Steve L.\n\nMaybe they could throw in Duece Watts as a sweetener. You can't believe that Austin and a third-rounder would be enough to get Metcalf, especially with how much dead money Seattle would take on ($7.5 million this year and next year in a post-June 1 trade, according to Over the Cap). That is wild. Beyond that, Metcalf coming here seems like a pipe dream.\n\nWho are your opening-day starters on the offensive line, left to right? -- Jan M.\n\nHe will start the entire season. The only way he comes out is if he gets injured. Bank it.\n\nHow highly is Cory Trice regarded by the organization, and is a trade for Denver Broncos WR Courtland Sutton realistic? What would the cost be? -- Curt H.\n\nThey love Trice, but he's been hurt in college and as a rookie, so how much can you count on him? You can't. Sutton would be a great addition, wouldn't cost a lot and has a relationship with Wilson and Zach Azzanni, the new receivers coach. Maybe a third-rounder, but the extension would have to be worked out before a deal would be made.\n\nFans are fans when it comes to this (most of them). If he can help them win and is cheap, bring him on. I always had great conversations with Sutton when he was here, but that means nothing. I highly doubt the Steelers would sign him.\n\nDo you expect Art Smith to have special plays/drives scripted for Fields at QB in most games? -- Danny C.\n\nNo. Maybe you can see red zone stuff, but Wilson was good in the red zone last year. I don't see him getting any playing time, and that includes kickoffs.\n\nAfter these two drafts, if we don't win a playoff game, will mediocre Mike Tomlin finally get his walking papers? -- Jay H.\n\nNope.\n\nOdds on trading Moore before the start of the season? -- Jimmy H.\n\nSlim. Well, put it this way: Spencer Anderson would have to have a spectacular preseason, and Fautanu would have to win the starting job, and even then, I wouldn't do it. You have depth with Moore, and you want to give him away for a Day 3 pick? No thanks.\n\nThe Steelers are typically hesitant to play rookies early. Do you think the way Joey Porter Jr. and Broderick Jones played last year gives the organization confidence to trust the rookies? -- Steve S.\n\nThey've played a lot of rookies recently. Moore, Pickens, Harris, Pat Freiermuth, Kendrick Green, Dan Moore, Javon Hargrave and Sean Davis come to mind. You start rookies when they are clear-cut stars or by far the best option at the position, and Fautanu and Frazier check those boxes.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

However, for as good as the Steelers have been in terms of building great defenses, they might be better at drafting and developing wide receivers. Every year, it feels like the Steelers draft a receiver in the second or third round, and somehow that player ends up looking like an excellent selection.\n\nMike Wallace, Emmanuel Sanders, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and Diontae Johnson are just a few players the Steelers have drafted on Day 2 who have had successful NFL careers. That isn't even including players drafted beyond the third round like Martavis Bryant and Antonio Brown, or players who at least had some impact on the team like Sammie Coates or Markus Wheaton. This year, the team is hoping Roman Wilson can be its next big hit, and on the Establish The Run podcast, ESPN analyst Field Yates broke down why he believes Wilson should succeed, as well as the one issue he could stunt his growth.\n\n\"I think that Roman Wilson maybe landed in one of the better spots for a guy going in the third round regardless of position. This may be bad logic, but the Steelers get the benefit of the doubt from me when it comes to second and third-round wideouts. They've just crushed this sweet spot for so long, so if he's good enough in their eyes to be a third-round pick, he's good enough in my eyes,\" Yates said. \"My big concerns would be that he's not gonna play with a quarterback, regardless of who starts, who at this juncture of his career is like this pure, natural pocket rhythm passer. Both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields can be see it, throw it quarterbacks.\"\n\nYates isn't wrong about the Steelers' quarterback situation, as a big knock on both quarterbacks is that they can't make as many plays within the pocket as they do outside of it. Wilson should be a primary slot receiver who has a heavier presence in the middle of the field, but both quarterbacks have usually been more inclined to throw down the sidelines than over the middle. It will be interesting to see how Arthur Smith balances all of the skill sets of these different players in his offense, and whether or not it can translate into success.\n\nAs Yates says though, the Steelers have been adept at drafting receivers in this range, with far more hits than misses, so they have earned the benefit of the doubt. No one is expecting Wilson to come in and be Antonio Brown, but if he blocks well and develops more as a receiver as the year goes on, he'll earn time to compete on the field. Let's just hope he isn't Limas Sweed.\n\nRelated Items:Establish The Run podcast, Field Yates, Roman Wilson Recommended for you Clark: Could Roman Wilson Be Steelers WR2?

Sure, there have been some standout performances. WR George Pickens exploded onto the scene as a rookie in 2022. Despite some lapses in effort, he improved in 2023. The running game has been fairly consistent overall as well. To most people, the biggest problems have been the quarterback play and the offensive coordinator.\n\nHowever, the truth is the Steelers have struggled across the board on offense for the last five years. It goes beyond execution at the quarterback position and issues with play calling. The players on the field around the quarterback simply haven't done that great either. How do we know?\n\nIan Hartitz posted his \"Supporting Cast Rating\" on Monday encompassing the last five NFL seasons. This encompasses Pro Football Focus grades for how well players run the ball, catch the ball, and block in both the passing and running games. The Steelers have ranked 25th or lower in four of the last five seasons. The lone \"high\" spot came in 2022 when they ranked 15th in the league. They have an average rank of 24.8, 28th in the league.\n\nThe only teams with a worse five-year average are the Los Angeles Chargers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the New York Giants, and the New York Jets. Of that group, only the Chargers have managed at least one season ranking in the top half of the league.\n\nNow it can be hard to separate a quarterback's performance from how well a wide receiver plays. You can probably also factor in how an offensive coordinator schemes the offense. However, there are plenty of instances on a football field where a player either wins or loses a rep against the player in front of him. By trying to look at every single snap, you can get an idea of how well a player is performing independent of the other issues.\n\nSo you can take this ranking with a grain of salt, certainly. That being said, we know how the Steelers have struggled to find talent in the draft and nurture it accordingly. They failed to develop offensive linemen in Kendrick Green and Kevin Dotson, the latter of whom has gone elsewhere and played quite well. They didn't pick up Najee Harris' fifth-year option.\n\nWe can also see how the Steelers approached the 2024 NFL Draft. They have seen the issues with the pass and run blocking, too. Why else would they draft three offensive linemen?\n\nThe entire offense has struggled for a myriad of reasons, but the \"supporting cast\" around the Steelers' litany of quarterbacks in the last five seasons hasn't exactly helped the team, either.\n\nRelated Items:Ian Hartitz, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pro Football Focus Recommended for you Steelers Projected To Have No Compensatory Picks In 2025 Logan Lee: Steelers Are Perfect Scheme Fit Renner: Steelers 'Went All In' On Arthur Smith's Offensive Vision With Draft Haul", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_pike@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Jeremy Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Green", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I FBS independent schools"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/steelers-pass-offense-seahawks-week-17.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

NFL analysts Brett Kollman and E.J. Snyder talked up the Steelers draft on their Bootleg Football podcast, naming the Steelers draft one of their favorites while praising the offensive line rebuild in particular.\n\n\"When you look at this line, top to bottom, how they basically reinforced the front line of this team, and said, quarterback play's gonna be important but not as important as it was because there's gonna be way fewer plays where we just expect the quarterback to win despite massive amounts of pressure, sort of take the team on his back. They knew they didn't want to set the team up like that so they didn't, and they got all our favorite top offensive linemen. This is going to a very, very difficult offensive line to deal with,\" Snyder said.\n\nKollman pointed out that Pittsburgh's offensive line was their biggest non-quarterback weakness over the last few years and this draft showed a change in philosophy by targeting multiple high-level offensive linemen instead of taking them later and trying to draft and develop. It was the second year in a row the Steelers took an offensive lineman in the first round after selecting Broderick Jones in 2023, and Pittsburgh then doubled up on the line by taking Frazier in the second, giving them potentially two plug-and-play starting linemen in Fautanu and Frazier.\n\nEver since Omar Khan and Andy Weidl took over, the offensive line has been a focus. Last year, the Steelers also signed Isaac Seumalo in addition to drafting Jones, and their work in the draft this year makes it clear just how important building the line to them. The Steelers are going to rely on their rushing attack this season under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, and building up the trenches will allow both Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris to potentially excel this season.\n\nAdditionally, Snyder said, it also means that the quarterback won't have to play hero ball, be it Justin Fields or Russell Wilson, and the extra time to throw will be crucial for both of them as they were among the most-sacked quarterbacks last season and had the slowest time to throw in the league.\n\nWith Smith running the offense, the Steelers can get back to being a physical, ground-and-pound football team, and getting some maulers up front will certainly make that easier to do. The Steelers couldn't go into the season without addressing the offensive tackle and center position, and they did so in a big way taking one of the top tackles in the entire class in Fautanu and the most experienced collegiate center in Frazier while adding key depth in McCormick with James Daniels entering a contract year.\n\nIt was an impressive haul by the Steelers, and their offensive line should be much improved from last season. It's going to be fun to see how much the improved offensive line can change the dynamic of the offense and see just how far this team can go if they're putting more points on the board.\n\nYou can listen to Snyder and Kollman's full thoughts on the Steelers and their other favorite drafts below.\n\nRelated Items:Bootleg Football, Brett Kollman, E.J.

In his final season with with the Wolfpack, Wilson recorded 138 tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss, 6.0 sacks, three interceptions and one touchdown, dominating in his final season from start to finish.\n\nDespite that dominance, Wilson fell to the third round at No. 98 overall to the Steelers, in large part due to injury concerns.\n\nBut if he can stay healthy, he might be the steal of the draft.\n\nOne Atlantic Coast Conference offensive coordinator believes he can have a long career. In a piece for ESPN.com, that ACC offensive coordinator told ESPN Senior Writer Adam Rittenberg that Wilson was \"different\" and a guy who really opened eyes when they had to prepare to play the Wolfpack.\n\n\"Of all the guys we played, he was like, 'Holy s -- , he's different,'\"the ACC offensive coordinator said to Rittenberg, according to ESPN.com. \"That dude has such a relentless motor, and he's long. If he can stay healthy, that kid will play for a long, long time.\"\n\nHealth is the biggest question with Wilson. That much is very well known at this point.\n\nDuring his final year of high school and then early in his tenure in Raleigh, Wilson had two major knee injuries. He also suffered a major shoulder injury. But Wilson was able to stay healthy the last two seasons and put up that dominant 2023 season. The concerns with Wilson's health is more long-term, which had 22 teams reportedly believing Wilson is just a one-contract player.\n\nThe Steelers jumped at the opportunity to get him in the third round though, landing arguably the best linebacker in the class based on tape alone. He moved at a different speed on tape compared to other linebackers, and that showed up when he clocked a 4.43 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nWilson has great size and athleticism, too, and should be able to contribute in Pittsburgh right away. He has stated he wants to fly around and rip people's heads off, which will endear him to the fan base rather quickly in the Steel City. That relentless motor the ACC offensive coordinator talked about will come in handy there, as will the size and length.\n\nIf Wilson can stay healthy, look out. It might be the steal of the draft, one that Steelers GM Omar Khan can stake his reputation on for a bit as the GM that took the chance and was rewarded.\n\nRelated Items:ACC, ESPN, North Carolina State, Payton Wilson, Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending Recommended for you Buy Or Sell: Steelers Should Have Drafted CB T.J.

The franchise was not content with treading water and simply getting to the postseason - they have bigger aims. So they went to work retooling and reloading their roster and it's led them back into contention, according to one analyst.\n\nThe Steelers are one of five teams that Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski tabbed as having \"reignited\" their Super Bowl hopes following free agency and the NFL Draft and his faith in them is rooted in the upgrade they made at quarterback.\n\n\"The Kenny Pickett first-round selection flopped. To Pittsburgh's credit, the organization didn't fall prey to the sunk-cost fallacy. Instead, general manager Omar Khan immediately pursued Russell Wilson after the Denver Broncos released the veteran quarterback. Khan doubled down at the game's most important position by flipping a conditional 2025 sixth-round draft pick to the Chicago Bears for Justin Fields,\" Sobleski wrote. \"The Steelers may be buying low when it comes to both of these quarterbacks, yet each is an upgrade over what the team featured a year ago when it still found a way to win 10 games and snuck into the postseason.\"\n\nSobleski went on to praise the Steelers' top draft selections - mainly offensive line additions Troy Fautanu, Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick, the first two of which he believes will be immediate starters. Roman Wilson was a 'perfect fit,' according to Sobleski and now this improved offense can come closer to matching the quality of its elite counterparts on defense.\n\nEven the defense got stronger with the addition of linebacker Patrick Queen to complement T.J. Watt, Cam Heyward, Minkah Fitzpatrick and Deshon Elliott. He's high on rookie Payton Wilson as a reserve linebacker as well.\n\nIt all adds up to an optimistic outlook for the Steelers, according to Sobleski, who thinks they will be contenders even in a crowded AFC North.\n\n\"The AFC North will be a dog fight this fall, especially with Joe Burrow and Deshaun Watson expected to be healthy,\" he said. \"The Steelers have closed the most ground throughout this offseason, though.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_thompson@si.com", "name": "Stephen Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

However, there are those whose attention shifts (at least in part) to next year's draft. Whether that's the absurdly early mock drafts or, in the case of Over The Cap's Nick Korte, the compensatory pick formula, the NFL draft process never really ends. Even those of us who don't fully pay attention to the draft year-round still wonder if the Pittsburgh Steelers will have any compensatory picks the following year.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like the Steelers won't. On Monday afternoon, Korte released his projections for the 2025 NFL Draft's compensatory picks. He projects that the Baltimore Ravens will get four extra picks (including one for new Steelers LB Patrick Queen) and the Cleveland Browns will get two while neither the Steelers nor the Cincinnati Bengals get one.\n\nThis has been a trend for the Steelers. They did not receive compensatory picks in the 2024 NFL Draft or in the 2023 edition. Why is this happening? In simplest terms, the Steelers are adding either comparable or even more expensive free agents than the players they are losing to free agency. According to OverTheCap, the Steelers have signed three players who are eligible to add compensatory picks for their previous teams. Queen is one of them while S DeShon Elliott is in line to add a seventh-round pick for the Miami Dolphins. The site also highlights KR Cordarelle Patterson as potentially adding a seventh-round pick for the Atlanta Falcons but doesn't in Korte's projection.\n\nConversely, the Steelers' loss of DL Armon Watts is offset by the addition of P Cameron Johnston.\n\nSo at the moment, we can expect the Steelers will not add any additional picks in the 2025 NFL Draft courtesy of the league. We also know they will be making those selections in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nWhat is unknown is exactly what picks the Steelers will be making. At the moment, the Steelers hold their standard selections in each of the first three rounds. Once the fourth round hits, then there are plenty of scenarios thanks to recent trades the team made. The most notable ones include the Justin Fields trade with the Chicago Bears, the Kenny Pickett trade to the Philadelphia Eagles, and the William Jackson III with the Washington Commanders back in 2022.\n\nSo even without the compensatory picks, the 2025 NFL Draft is shaping up to be an interesting one with conditional picks and trades having affected picks after the first three rounds.\n\nRelated Items:2025 NFL Draft, compensatory picks, Nick Korte, OverTheCap.com, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Logan Lee: Steelers Are Perfect Scheme Fit Renner: Steelers 'Went All In' On Arthur Smith's Offensive Vision With Draft Haul Albert Breer Confused By Analysts Wanting Steelers To Trade For Big-Name WR: 'Never Been' What They Do", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_pike@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Jeremy Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Queen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeShon_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeShon Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jackson_III", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Jackson III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mike-Tomlin-Omar-Khan-Presser-Stock-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Before you know it, the 2024 season will be upon us.\n\nFor now, there is a lot of downtime between now and the start of training camp. There are some roster additions and subtractions that are surely in the Steelers' future. But with the draft finalized and the roster seemingly looking much like it will entering training camp, I wanted to see what a potential 53-man roster could look like.\n\nSo, today I take my way-too-early shot at predicting the Steelers' 53-man roster.\n\nAway we go.\n\nOFFENSE - 25\n\nQuarterbacks (3) - Russell Wilson, Justin Fields, Kyle Allen\n\nAnalysis: Pretty chalk here, though the order they are in on the depth chart is up for debate. Russell Wilson is in \"pole position\" entering the offseason and will get first crack at starting, while Justin Fields will undoubtedly compete for the job. The Steelers completely reshaped their quarterback room this offseason, and on paper it looks better than it has in a few years with Wilson and Fields. Having Kyle Allen at QB3 is a nice security blanket.\n\nRunning Backs (4) - Najee Harris, Jaylen Warren, Cordarrelle Patterson, Daijun Edwards\n\nAnalysis: Going with four running backs here for the Steelers in the first year under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. The Steelers are going to want to run the football a great deal, and they have the workhorses to do it with Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. That's a dynamic 1-2 punch. Cordarrelle Patterson is a solid No. 3 with experience in Smith's system, but it's likely he's only on the roster due to the new kick return role. I'm keeping UDFA Daijun Edwards too in this scenario because of his experience at RB and his abilities in the return game, giving him a chance to learn under Patterson.\n\nFullback (0) -\n\nAnalysis: Though Arthur Smith loves the fullback in his offense, the Steelers don't have one on the roster currently, and I don't think they'll add one. Someone like Connor Heyward or MyCole Pruitt will be the H-back and handle some lead-blocking duties.\n\nTight Ends (4) - Pat Freiermuth, Darnell Washington, Connor Heyward, MyCole Pruitt\n\nAnalysis: Rodney Williams is the odd man out here due to the offseason addition of MyCole Pruitt, who is a favorite of Smith's. Pat Freiermuth is in line for a contract extension and should be a larger focal point in Smith's offense. Darnell Washington will be that in-line blocking piece for the Steelers again, while Connor Heyward and Pruitt can be those H-back/TEs who could be lead blockers and weapons in the passing game.\n\nWide Receivers (5) - George Pickens, Roman Wilson, outside addition, Van Jefferson, Calvin Austin III\n\nAnalysis: The top two is set with George Pickens and Roman Wilson, that much I feel good about. Pickens is going to be the true WR1 in Pittsburgh now and should be a key focal point in the passing game. Wilson just profiles like a Steeler and will be a good blocking option and a chain-moving receiver in the passing game. But after that...sheesh. The Steelers need to add a veteran via either free agency or trade to complement Pickens and Wilson. Van Jefferson is a solid No. 3-4 who has experience in Smith's offense, and I am giving Calvin Austin III the edge over Quez Watkins in large part due to his punt returning abilities.\n\nOffensive Tackles (4) - Broderick Jones, Dan Moore Jr., Troy Fautanu, Dylan Cook\n\nAnalysis: First-round pick Troy Fautanu will likely start right away at tackle for the Steelers, whether that's on the left or right side. Broderick Jones is a clear-cut starter, whether that's on the left or right side. That means Dan Moore Jr., assuming he's not flipped for draft capital, moves to the swing tackle role, where I think he could thrive as a run blocker. The hardest decision was keeping Dylan Cook over Spencer Anderson here. While I like Anderson and tried to fit him in at guard or center, it became a numbers game, and I like Cook's size and overall upside.\n\nOffensive Guards (3) - Isaac Seumalo, James Daniels, Nate Herbig\n\nAnalysis: Pretty chalk here. Isaac Seumalo and James Daniels will be the starting guard tandem once again. They were very solid overall last season and should fit well in Smith's scheme as the Steelers lean further into the run-heavy approach. Nate Herbig is good depth to have at both guard positions while also having some center flexibility. Both Daniels and Herbig are entering contract years, so that's noteworthy.\n\nCenters (2) - Zach Frazier, Mason McCormick\n\nAnalysis: Again, pretty chalk here. Zach Frazier was drafted by Pittsburgh to be the plug-and-play center for both now and long-term. He is exactly what the Steelers needed, and they were fortunate to land him at No. 51 overall. I am listing McCormick here at center simply for the depth chart purposes. He is guard capable at left and right guard, and Pittsburgh worked him out at center before the draft, so I would guess he'll get work there throughout the offseason.\n\nDEFENSE - 25\n\nDefensive Ends (4) - Cameron Heyward, Larry Ogunjobi, Dean Lowry, Logan Lee\n\nAnalysis: The defensive end group remains on the older side with Cameron Heyward turning 35 years old tomorrow, Larry Ogunjobi 30 and Dean Lowry turning 30 in June. Heyward dealt with injuries last season and wasn't himself, while Ogunjobi was a bit of a disappointment. The Steeler did well to add Lowry in free agency on a two-year deal, and I really like the selection of Lee in the draft. But this is a position group that is going to need major attention in the draft moving forward.\n\nNose Tackles (2) - Keeanu Benton, Montravius Adams\n\nAnalysis: This group is all but set. I can't see anything changing between now and the start of the season. Keeanu Benton showed flashes of dominance as a rookie in 2023 and is now firmly entrenched as the guy at the nose tackle position. I'd like to see him play more in sub-package football, too. Re-signing Montravius Adams on a two-year deal was smart. He had moments in a limited role last season and fits well in Pittsburgh defensively.\n\nEDGE Rushers (4) - T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, Nick Herbig, Jeremiah Moon\n\nAnalysis: The top three of T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, and Nick Herbig is set in stone. Watt remains arguably the best defender in football, Highsmith took a major step forward last season as one of the more complete edge defenders in football, and Herbig looked quite good in a relief role. Currently, OLB4 is unknown with Markus Golden a free agent. The Steelers claimed Jeremiah Moon off waivers from the Baltimore Ravens in January. He has some experience and special teams abilities, so he's the best bet right now, though I wouldn't write off UDFA Jacoby Windmon, or Kyron Johnson.\n\nInside Linebackers (4) - Patrick Queen, Elandon Roberts, Cole Holcomb, Payton Wilson\n\nAnalysis: I really, really struggled with this one. I wanted to keep five linebackers and have Mark Robinson as the true special teams piece at the inside linebacker position, but I couldn't get the math to work. Patrick Queen headlines the group and brings All-Pro abilities to Pittsburgh, while Elandon Roberts had a great season for the Steelers in 2023. A tandem of Queen and Roberts early in 2024 should be fun to watch. Cole Holcomb's health is unknown at this point, but he if he can make it back, that strengthens the room. The addition of Payton Wilson is going to be one of the main one to watch this summer. If he can't at least see the field defensively early, he should be a special teams ace with his athleticism, speed and mentality.\n\nCornerbacks (6) - Joey Porter Jr., Donte Jackson, outside addition, Cory Trice Jr., Darius Rush, Beanie Bishop Jr.\n\nAnalysis: Feels like a bit of a cop-out here with the \"outside addition\" like I did at receiver, but with how the depth chart looks currently at the position, the Steelers need some help. Joey Porter Jr. is poised for a big second season, while the acquisition of Donte Jackson was a solid one to address CB2. Cory Trice Jr. and Darius Rush are exciting Year 2 players, but even having them as CB4-5 on the roster feels like asking a bit too much right now. I really like WVU's Beanie Bishop Jr. and think he's the ideal next slot CB for the Steelers. Hopefully he has a strong summer and makes the roster. Notice I left sixth-round pick Ryan Watts off here. I just did not feel comfortable having Trice, Rush, Watts and Bishop -- all second-year or rookie players -- behind Porter and Jackson. There's just no way the Steelers do that...right?\n\nSafeties (5) - Minkah Fitzpatrick, Damontae Kazee, DeShon Elliott, Trenton Thompson, Miles Killebrew\n\nAnalysis: The only real debate here, in my opinion, is Trenton Thompson or a name like Jalen Elliott or Nate Meadors or Ryan Watts making the move to safety for that role. I went with Thompson here because of the experience he has in the Steelers' defense. I liked what he showed last season in an expanded role due to injuries. Minkah Fitzpatrick is the surefire No. 1, face-of-the-defense player, while Kazee is back for the final year of his two-year deal, looking to make amends after being suspended three games last season for a bad hit in Indianapolis. DeShon Elliott is going to bring serious physicality to the position, which should be quite a bit of fun to watch, and Miles Killebrew is the special teams ace. Relatively solid group from top to bottom.\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS - 3\n\nKicker (1) - Chris Boswell\n\nAnalysis: Chris Boswell isn't going anywhere anytime soon, especially after connecting on 29-of-31 field goals last year.\n\nPunter (1) - Cameron Johnston\n\nAnalysis: Needing a punter entering the offseason after cutting Pressley Harvin III, the Steelers struck quickly in free agency, landing Johnston on a three-year, $9 million deal. He was one of the best punters on the market and has been one of the better NFL punters throughout his career. Finally, it feels like the Steelers are set at punter.\n\nLong Snapper (1) - Christian Kuntz\n\nAnalysis: The Steelers signed Christian Kuntz to a three-year contract in March. He's not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nRelated Items:George Pickens, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Pittsburgh Steelers, Russell Wilson, T.J.

The Steelers took three offensive linemen with their first four picks, with the only non-lineman being Michigan wideout Roman Wilson. In the later rounds, Pittsburgh added defensive depth at key positions.\n\nDespite addressing many of their immediate needs, the Steelers still have a few holes on the roster. Here are three agents Pittsburgh should pursue after the 2024 NFL Draft\n\nTyler Boyd (WR), Cincinnati Bengals\n\nWith the trade of Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers, an all-ready meager Steelers wide receiver corps became even thinner. Pittsburgh lost a guy who put up nearly 900 yards per season in his five years at Heinz Field and did so despite consistently underwhelming quarterback play. Johnson's replacement is rookie third-round pick Roman Wilson of Michigan.\n\nWilson is an explosive player with 4.39 speed and he led all receivers in this draft class with an 85% separation rate against man coverage. The Michigan pass-catcher will immediately be in contention for a starting spot in Pittsburgh, but the Steelers still lack a proven receiver opposite George Pickens. No WR outside Pickens or Johnson had more than 300 receiving yards last year. The team addressed this need by adding Quez Watkins (142 yards with the Philadelphia Eagles) and Van Jefferson (combined 208 yards with the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams).\n\nTyler Boyd is the clear number-one remaining free-agent wideout and is an experienced player with a consistent record of productivity. Boyd is a solid underneath threat who has surpassed 600 receiving yards in each of the last six seasons. He is also a native of the Pittsburgh area. While he will turn 30 in the fall, Tyler Boyd is still a solid receiver who can hold down the WR2 role until Roman Wilson is ready to shine.\n\nSteven Nelson (CB), Houston Texans\n\nPittsburgh's front office addressed most of the team's needs in the 2024 NFL Draft. The franchise brought in numerous offensive linemen, added a solid WR2/WR3, and added depth at linebacker and defensive line. The one area the team did somewhat ignore was the secondary. The Steelers drafted Texas defensive back Ryan Watts III, who has good length and is a strong tackler, he lacks the athleticism to play cornerback (his college position) in the NFL. But with a lack of depth at cornerback, Watts is in contention with 2023 seventh-rounder Corey Trice for the nickel corner spot in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers need a veteran cornerback who can easily slot into the nickel spot and compete for a starting role alongside Joey Porter Jr. Steven Nelson has bounced around -- playing for four teams over the last six seasons -- but has been quietly successful at every stop. This includes a two-year stint in the Steel City. The 30-year-old had four picks in 2023 for the Houston Texans and allowed a passer rating of just 73.3 when targeted. Nelson's adaptability makes him an ideal addition to this Pittsburgh secondary.\n\nBud Dupree (OLB), Atlanta Falcons\n\nWhen it comes to having a great pass rush, sacking the quarterback is a team effort. T.J. Watt is one of the NFL's elite when it comes to taking down the quarterback, but it is the players alongside him also providing pressure that helps Watt reach full productivity. Alex Highsmith is a Pro-Bowl-level edge-rusher on the opposite side, while Nick Herbig and Markus Golden provided a combined seven sacks in limited time as rotational players. Herbig will take up a bigger role with Golden entering free agency, but Pittsburgh could still use another secondary edge rusher.\n\nThe Steelers should look to facilitate another reunion with a former defensive starter: Bud Dupree. Since leaving Pittsburgh in 2021, Dupree has averaged 4.5 sacks a year for the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons. At age 31, he will look to join a contending team late in his career, and a return to Pittsburgh could mark one last shot at a Super Bowl.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_hanley@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Liam Hanley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acrisure Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Queen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Markus Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Dupree", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bud Dupree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

It was a surprise that Troy Fautanu was there at 20, Zach Frazier fills a big need for them, and both Roman Wilson and Payton Wilson seem to be steals at the spots they were selected.\n\nSometimes the Day One and Day Two picks get all the love, but there are still a lot of great players to be had on Day Three. That's what separates the good teams from the great teams - the depth they can add to their rosters during these later rounds.\n\nAnd the Steelers made some solid selections there as well, with one standing out to Bootleg Football podcast host Brett Kollmann. He selected Mason McCormick, the offensive lineman from South Dakota State as the Steelers' best value pick of the draft.\n\n\"Mason McCormick was the 8th most athletic guard prospect out of 1,583 guards since 1987.\" Kollmann said. \"This dude is a freak. And he's an ultra-experienced freak. He had over 50 starts across 6 seasons at South Dakota State. And uniquely for any experienced guard prospect, he also has experience calling protections as a guard.\"\n\nI had the chance to watch McCormick at the Shrine Bowl in person, and I largely agree with this assessment. Does he have crazy upside? No, probably not at his age for his rookie season. But his floor is very high, and that's pretty much the best you can expect from a fourth-round offensive lineman. And his athletic ability gives him a higher ceiling than your usual 6th-year offensive guard.\n\nThe other interesting piece about McCormick is his versatility. He can play both guard spots and spent some time under center at the Shrine Bowl, where he looked more than capable. The Steelers made a point to not only add bodies but also versatility to the offensive line group through the draft.\n\n\"For the first time in a long time, I actually think the Steelers are pretty deep up front.\" Kollmann continued. \"It's been almost a decade since I think I could say that. I loved all of the Steelers' offensive line picks.\"\n\nThe Steelers will likely have two rookie Day One starters, in Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier. McCormick would likely only see the field this season if there was an injury to Isaac Seumalo or James Daniels and he could slot in at guard. There's also a chance if Zach Frazier gets hurt that McCormick would be the best in-house option, but we will see how much work he gets there over the offseason.\n\nMcCormick isn't going to thrill any of the casual Steelers fans, and he's not going to be the biggest breakout rookie of the year by any means. But in the fourth round, he's a great value and has a clearly defined role on a team looking to make some noise in 2024.\n\nRelated Items:Bootleg Football, Brett Kollmann, Mason McCormick Recommended for you Report: Multiple Steelers Rookies Receive New Numbers Examining NFL Teams' Pick Value In The 2024 Draft Brian Baldinger Gives Steelers A+ Draft Grade", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_calderone@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Tony Calderone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Kollmann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roland Kollmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_State_Jackrabbits_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota State Jackrabbits football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Seumalo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Seumalo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Baldinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Baldinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie_of_the_Year_(award)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie of the Year (award)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mason-McCormick-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

However, it appears hopes for a blockbuster deal likely won't lead to a big addition.\n\nPittsburgh is well-situated to make a move. With $18 million of cap space available right now and more than $90 million in 2025, per OverTheCap.com, there's enough draft capital and financial flexibility to add a playmaker. Furthermore, a Steelers depth chart led by George Pickens, Roman Wilson and Van Jefferson demonstrates their need for another pass-catcher.\n\nRelated: Former Pittsburgh Steelers player thinks Mike Tomlin could be fired\n\nHowever, as Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated explained in his weekly column, it seems quite unlikely that the Steelers will be making a move for a big-name wide receiver anytime soon.\n\n\"It's never been Pittsburgh's m.o. to do something like that at that particular position. And I can't imagine trading Johnson is some sort of big needle-mover in this regard, either...The last time the Steelers' leading receiver wasn't homegrown was in the year the United States entered World War II -- 1941 (Don Looney, if you're scoring at home). And over the years, Pittsburgh has been able to replace guys such as Plaxico Burress, Wallace, Sanders and Brown as they've left the organization.\"\n\nRelated: Pittsburgh Steelers coaches discussed new role for Justin Fields\n\nIn many ways, it's similar to the Green Bay Packers' philosophy. In both instances of replacing Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams, Green Bay relied on its draft-and-develop philosophy in finding new starters at those positions.\n\nThis isn't to suggest that the Steelers don't make trades, they upgraded their secondary a few years ago by trading a first-round pick for Minkah Fitzpatrick. However, this is an organization that believes in internal replacements and having starters develop in their system. Because of that, trading for Samuel, AIyul or any other high-profile wide receiver seems unlikely.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_johnson@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaxico_Burress", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaxico Burress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davante_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davante Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NFL-Preseason-Buffalo-Bills-at-Pittsburgh-Steelers-21247457.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

With each of their first two contests played at home, the Steelers struggled on offense while showing the previous week that their defense was more than capable of propping up the team.\n\nWeek 3's matchup would be another primetime game, this time against the Las Vegas Raiders. It would be the Raiders home opener, and the first time that the Steelers would be playing since the franchise relocated.\n\nSteelers fans were trying to figure out if the first two games were the result of playing against good defenses, or if this Pittsburgh team wasn't the same one, they saw light up the scoreboard during the preseason.\n\nThey would soon have their surprising answer, though it didn't begin that way (and it still wasn't pretty!)\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Steelers offense would take the field first, running the football all three downs. Najee Harris gained four and five yards on his first two carries, but then offensive coordinator Matt Canada tried to fool everyone and had QB Kenny Pickett hand off to Connor Heyward for no gain on third down. The Steelers would punt.\n\nVegas failed to convert on their first series, also going three and out, but a nice Calvin Austin scamper out to the logo would be setback by a James Pierre holding penalty. Starting at their own 23-yard-line, the Steelers stayed conservative again on first down, with Harris gaining four yards. Pickett would attempt his first two passes thereafter, both incomplete, as the offense stalled with another three-and-out.\n\nThe Raiders took advantage from here. Gaining ground, a would-be fumble was reversed during replay review, giving Las Vegas new life. They would march 74 yards in 7 plays, with a 32-yard connection from QB Jimmy Garoppolo to Davante Adams finishing in a TD.\n\nThe Steelers surprises started right after, as the offense matched the Raiders score with Pickett delivering a 72-yard bomb to Austin to tie the game at seven apiece.\n\nThe Steelers would never trail from this point forward, but the offense still sputtered at times. Chris Boswell would deliver the next three scores with field goals of 43, 42, and 57 yards. In fact, the Steelers would only punt once between the Austin touchdown and another strike from Pickett to TE Pat Freiermuth in the third quarter that put Pittsburgh up 23-7.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nYet, the game was far from over. Oftentimes it felt as if the Steelers were intentionally trying to keep the Raiders in the game.\n\nAt the end of the first half, there was still time on the clock and they had two timeouts. Instead of trying to attempt to put more points on the scoreboard, they simply let the time run out. Interesting, but not completely ridiculous.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, though, with only a five-point lead, Pittsburgh ran three run plays that were obvious and sniffed out easily resulting in a loss of downs and yardage. They couldn't have looked any more like they were purposefully giving the Raiders another shot to possibly go on a game-winning drive than if they'd put up a billboard outside Acrisure Stadium on Friday.\n\nOnly thanks to a nice Pressley Harvin punt that was muffed and recovered by the Raiders did the Steelers prevent a real comeback from Garoppolo and Las Vegas. The punt play took a huge chunk of time off the game clock. And the result, eventually, was that Garoppolo threw an errant pass that ended up being intercepted. It would be Jimmy G's third interception of the game, as the Steelers defense sealed a 23-18 victory and improved to 2-1 on the season.\n\nWhile Pickett looked more impressive than he had all season (this would be his first multiple touchdown game as a pro) his 57.1% completion rate and 235 passing yards (72 of which came on the Austin deep pass) kept fans from being too optimistic. The defense was also a bend but don't break observation, as they allowed the Raiders to have possessions of 10, 11, and 9 plays all in the fourth quarter.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nDespite some struggles early, the offense leaned on running backs Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren to setup the ground game. Compared to 28 pass attempts, the Steelers would run the ball 31 times, with - get this - 28 of those as designed runs. (The other three were by Pickett, with two of those as QB scrambles.)\n\nIn total the Steelers outgained the Raiders 105 to 69 despite Las Vegas having last year's rushing leader Josh Jacobs.\n\nT.J. Watt, who entered the weekend as the league's sack leader, finished the game by adding two more sacks to his six on the season, including three quarterback hits and two tackles for loss. Watt was also responsible for the pressure on Jimmy Garoppolo's interception by Levi Wallace. Both sacks also led to Las Vegas going three-and-out on those respective drives.\n\nMost surprising in this game, however, was the Steelers hadn't won a road game traveling to the Raiders since December 10th, 1995! They had lost their previous four matchups (2006, 2012, 2013, 2018) which were all played in Oakland. Still, there was skepticism on the road ahead despite the 2-1 start to the season.\n\nNext up would be a Week 4 trip to another dome stadium in Houston, as the Steelers would face rookie QB C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans. Join us next week as we continue looking back at last year's games in our weekly recall series.", "source": {"uri": "steelcityunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steel City Underground"},

They took that to the extreme in the NFL draft", "body": "The Pittsburgh Steelers made a serious investment in their offensive line during the NFL draft By WILL GRAVES AP Sports Writer\n\nPITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers spent February overhauling their offensive coaching staff, March doing the same to the quarterback room and the last week of April giving the offensive line a massive injection of youth.\n\nThe huddle and the sideline will look significantly different this fall when the Steelers take the field in Week 1.\n\nHow longtime coach Mike Tomlin wants his team to move the ball, however, will not. The proof came over three sometimes-tense days of the NFL draft, when general manager Omar Khan's took his emphasis on building the team from the inside out to the extreme.\n\nThe Steelers selected offensive linemen with three of their first five picks, grabbing Washington tackle Troy Fautanu in the first round, West Virginia center Zach Frazier in the second and South Dakota State guard Mason McCormick in the fourth.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Doing it again nearly 50 years later highlights that while the game is ever-changing, some aspects remain timeless, particularly in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"It was a strong offensive line group,\" Khan said. \"We've talked plenty of times about how we feel about the importance of the offensive line ... it just kind of worked that way for us.\"\n\nFrazier and Fautanu figure to be given every chance to earn a starting job in training camp. Fautanu started 27 of 28 games at left tackle during his junior and senior seasons with the Huskies while Frazier was a four-year starter for the Mountaineers. McCormick, who figures to learn behind veterans Isaac Seumalo and James Daniels, suited up a staggering 70 times for the Jackrabbits.\n\n\"We're looking for guys with talent,\" Tomlin said. \"Oftentimes that talent is coupled with experience. It's good to have a group that's mature as players and as people. All that means is we should expect those guys to have a high floor and a good presentation of what they're capable of early on.\"\n\nFirst-year offensive coordinator Arthur Smith now has the tools to potentially re-create the dominant ground game he put together while calling plays with Tennessee in 2019 and 2020.\n\nInstead of Derrick Henry, Smith has Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren one of the best running back tandems in the league. Fautanu, Frazier and tackle Broderick Jones -- last year's first-round pick -- give the line a core that shares a pedigree with the group the Steelers had in the mid-2010s with center Maurkice Pouncey, guard David DeCastro and tackle Alejandro Villanueva.\n\n\"There's a certain style of play and intent we want that fits this team and the history here and the Steelers and the brand of football, a shared vision,\" Smith said.\n\nA vision Smith will try to see to fruition. While much of the attention during training camp will be on recently acquired quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, all around them it could be the same as it ever was in Pittsburgh.\n\nWAITING FOR WILSON, PART 1\n\nThe Steelers didn't neglect the other positions entirely. Pittsburgh drafted Michigan wide receiver Roman Wilson in the third round, won over by both his speed (Wilson ran a 4.39 40-yard dash) and his competitiveness.\n\nThe 5-foot-11 Wilson isn't afraid to go over the middle and is a willing blocker, a trait not always shared by his new teammates.\n\nPerhaps just as importantly to Tomlin, Wilson comes from a program coming off a national title.\n\n\"You can't say enough about the winning component in terms of the way it shapes (players like Wilson's) relationship with the game and what they're willing to do and their mettle,\" Tomlin said. \"He checks a lot of those boxes.\"\n\nWAITING FOR WILSON, PART 2\n\nPayton Wilson's college resume screamed high-end talent. That's what made the inside linebacker's availability late in the third round all the more startling to Khan and Tomlin.\n\nWilson won the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker after his final season at North Carolina State. Still, teams appeared to be scared off by his injury history, including multiple knee surgeries.\n\nNot the Steelers, who could pair Wilson with newly signed Patrick Queen at some point down the road.\n\n\"We're really excited about the collection of talent we've been able to assemble,\" Tomlin said.\n\nWHAT'S MISSING\n\nThe Steelers entered the draft with needs at wide receiver and the secondary. They ended the draft by tabbing Roman Wilson and taking a flyer on Texas defensive back Ryan Watts in the sixth round.\n\nWhile both have potential, Pittsburgh -- which is built to win now, as always -- could still use a serious talent influx at both positions before they report to training camp at Saint Vincent College in late July.\n\nOutside linebacker Alex Highsmith restructured his contract to free up a little salary cap space, and there's a very real chance Khan could go shopping in the coming weeks.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Pittsburgh Steelers Nfl Draft

But the team is through the bulk of its roster-building, the main waves of free agency and the 2024 NFL Draft. With that, we can look at the Steelers' veterans who won and lost the last few months regarding how the team's moves impact their status and role heading into the new year.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we'll use \"veteran\" as anyone who was part of the Steelers' roster throughout the 2023 season. Anyone who wasn't added over the last four months will be the only names excluded from consideration.\n\nWINNERS RBs Najee Harris/Jaylen Warren\n\nHarris' name might be weird to put in the \"winners\" column after Pittsburgh surprisingly declined his fifth-year option. But I still see the upside. The Steelers invested heavily in their offensive line in the draft, three of their first five picks dedicated to it, in a way that will obviously boost the running game.\n\nFor Harris and Warren, they'll run behind their best o-line since breaking into the NFL. And Harris, now slated to become a free agent after the season, could have a career year. If he does, he'll turn that into a payday on the other side of the season. And that makes him a winner. Warren will obviously benefit too though he's still two years out from unrestricted free agency. But Pittsburgh has the o-line to match the talent of its runners with a run-minded offensive coordinator.\n\nWR George Pickens\n\nAs of today, the Steelers have one true and proven outside receiver on the roster. That's Pickens. Pittsburgh drafted Roman Wilson but still hasn't fully replaced Diontae Johnson's outside/X-receiver role. Wilson has primarily operated out of the slot the past two seasons. That makes Pickens the current focus of the team's outside passing game and Russell Wilson likes to throw on the perimeter. It sets up Pickens for a big third season and potential extension next offseason.\n\nWR Dez Fitzpatrick\n\nWhile Pickens is an obvious name at the top of the receiver chart, Fitzpatrick is a winner closer to the bottom. Not because of what he can contribute offensively but on special teams. Miles Boykin signed with the New York Giants while James Pierre inked a deal with the Washington Commanders. Meaning, Pittsburgh's starting gunners the past two seasons need replaced.\n\nFitzpatrick made noise late in the summer and landed on the practice squad because of what he did as a gunner in preseason action, making tackles and downing punts. He could push for a No. 5 receiver spot and his special teams usefulness gives him a leg up on Van Jefferson and Quez Watkins, who don't have a skill set there.\n\nCBs Cory Trice Jr./Darius Rush\n\nThrowing both young corners on this list. Trice and Rush have plenty to prove to cement their roster spot. But aside from Donte Jackson, the Steelers have added nothing at outside corner. Instead, James Pierre and Levi Wallace signed elsewhere, leaving either of Trice or Rush to become a top backup and potential sub-package player.\n\nEach man has his obstacles to overcome. Trice tore his ACL during the team's first padded practice last summer, the latest in long line of injuries. Rush couldn't make the Indianapolis Colts' roster despite being a fifth-round pick and the Steelers became the third team he played for as a rookie, seeing scarce snaps down the stretch. But with cornerback depth weak and special teams spots for the taking -- the Steelers will have two new gunners in 2024 -- a good camp from either could have them in the driver's seat for a top backup corner role.\n\nOthers Worth Mentioning: TE/FB Connor Heyward, OLB Nick Herbig, TE Darnell Washington, FS Minkah Fitzpatrick\n\nLOSERS OT Dan Moore Jr.\n\nThough Dan Moore Jr. has shown impressive staying power throughout his career, and the team likes him more than most fans, at some point he's going to be benched. Pittsburgh can't keep drafting tackles and have Moore remain in the lineup. For the first time in team history, the Steelers drafted offensive linemen in the first round of back-to-back drafts. Moore's time as starter is running out.\n\nWith only left tackle experience, it's a tough ask for him to become a versatile swing man. He'll probably receive some right tackle reps this year, as he did last season, but everyone in that building, Moore included, understands he's not comfortable there. There's still value in keeping him even as just a left tackle backup but he's the underdog to start the year.\n\nDL Cam Heyward\n\nWhile Heyward's role hasn't changed, that's sorta the point. Pittsburgh has talked up the need to improve d-line depth and reduce his snap count. Did they? Ehhh. Names were added, a veteran in Dean Lowry and rookie in Logan Lee. But I don't see those as guys you're confident in enough to seriously reduce Heyward's snap count. In sub-packages, the Steelers still seem stuck on Heyward, Larry Ogunjobi, and Keeanu Benton. Who else can come in? Lowry and Loudermilk are base run defenders, Montravius Adams is athletic but an unsuccessful pass rusher, DeMarvin Leal has been better versus the run than pass and is far from guaranteed to make the team, while Lee's game and profile reminds me of Loudermilk.\n\nWhile Heyward will be healthy and should play well, Pittsburgh hasn't found his successor and a name who could help prolong his career by an extra season.\n\nLB Mark Robinson\n\nThe team continues to show its lack of trust in Robinson, loading up on inside linebackers in Patrick Queen and Payton Wilson. Even if Cole Holcomb remains sidelined, that puts Robinson only as the No. 4 inside linebacker to begin the season. Throw Holcomb in, if/when he returns, and Robinson may struggle to dress on gamedays. He can still make the roster and have a role, but he's likely maxed out as a special teamer and small-package, run-situation inside linebacker.\n\nOL Spencer Anderson\n\nA seventh-round pick a season ago, Anderson did well to stick on the roster all year even if he barely played. But after drafting three offensive linemen, Anderson's path to make the 53 has narrowed. He'll enter camp as the 10th offensive lineman for a team that typically keeps nine.\n\nIt could take injury or the team trading/cutting Dan Moore Jr. for Anderson to again make the 53-man roster.\n\nOthers Worth Mentioning: OG/C Nate Herbig, DL DeMarvin Leal, TE Rodney Williams\n\nRelated Items:George Pickens, Pittsburgh Steelers, Spencer Anderson, Trending, weekly Recommended for you

Tampa Instead Of Mason McCormick", "body": "Buy Or Sell: The Steelers should have drafted CB T.J. Tampa instead of OL Mason McCormick.\n\nExplanation: The Steelers drafted more offensive linemen than they needed, arguably, Mason McCormick slated for depth duty. While they valued him highly and view him as potentially a future starter, they had other needs, like cornerback. And T.J. Tampa is a cornerback viewed as having slid in the draft and who fits Pittsburgh's mold.\n\nBuy:\n\nThe Steelers lost four cornerbacks from last season and so far have only added one. Yes, they traded for presumed starter Donte Jackson, but he's not a long-term answer -- potentially a rental. You can argue the cornerbacks now gone are addition by subtraction, but you still need depth.\n\nAll they landed in the draft in the secondary is Ryan Watts. Billed as a cornerback, many believe his ultimate NFL position is safety, so that doesn't help. T.J. Tampa is a player with a lot of talent who we projected as a Day-Two fit.\n\nEven with Joey Porter Jr. and Jackson, who is the Steelers' third cornerback? Cory Trice Jr. and his imploding knee? Darius Rush, the guy who's on his third team since last year's draft? Mason McCormick might be a nice player, but contextually, he was a luxury, while Tampa was a need. And possibly the better player.\n\nSell:\n\nT.J. Tampa would be just another in the mix of Day-Three unproven cornerbacks. Both Darius Rush and Cory Trice Jr. graded higher than team took them last year. It happens to a lot of players every year, because there are more talents per round than picks. And he's coming in as a rookie.\n\nOn top of that, he doesn't have a lot of experience in the slot, and that's where the Steelers need somebody. Behind Porter and Jackson, Tampa wouldn't see the field anyway. In contrast, Mason McCormick could be one snap away from playing.\n\nThe Steelers drafted McCormick because they saw an opportunity to get a future starter on Day 3. You can't always count on that, and they know Nate Herbig and James Daniels are free agents in 2025. They rightly prioritized the offensive line in the past two years, and this was a part of that.\n\nWith the Steelers' 2023 season in the rearview mirror following a disappointing year that came up short in the playoffs once again, it's time to start asking more questions. Questions about the team's future in 2024 and beyond. Questions about The Standard.\n\nThe rookie class of a year ago was on the whole impressive, but they need to step up into staple starters in 2024. And they likely need a strong influx of talent in both free agency and in the 2024 NFL Draft yet again. In addition to a revisitation of the coaching staff.\n\nThese sorts of uncertainties are what I will look to address in our Buy or Sell series.

NBC Sports' Chris Simms certainly believes it is, calling the lack of depth at the cornerback position his biggest question for the Steelers.\n\n\"I'm not big on their DBs, right? Their corners, right? I know everybody likes Joey Porter Jr. and all that, but to me, my other question for them would be, can they play man to man against the really good offenses in football?\" Simms said on the latest episode of his Chris Simms Unbuttoned podcast. \"And I'm not sold on that. Joey Porter's got attitude. He's certainly got a role. He had a good year. I get all of that.\n\n\"But you get to the rest of the names at DB for them. I just go, 'Okay. Alright. So who's covering Tee Higgins when you play Ja'Marr Chase and them, or who's covering the other guy?'\"\n\nIt's definitely a valid question, one we've written about extensively here at Steelers Depot. The Steelers certainly seem to have a true No. 1 cornerback in Porter moving forward. He showed he can handle a true No. 1, shutdown role last season as a rookie, stepping up and playing quite well in some key spots.\n\nIn fact, Porter allowed just 25 receptions for 384 yards and one touchdown on 54 targets last season, according to Pro Football Focus, with a completion rate of just 46.3%. That was the second-lowest completion percentage allowed in the NFL last season, trailing only Kansas City's Joshua Williams, who played only 236 coverage snaps compared to Porter's 535.\n\nBehind Porter, Jackson -- who was acquired via trade from the Carolina Panthers for wide receiver Diontae Johnson and a pick swap -- slots in as the starter opposite the second-year pro. He was solid last season in Carolina with a coverage grade of 66.6. He allowed 45 receptions for 559 yards and four touchdowns last season, but on a better defense with better pieces around him, the Steelers are banking on Jackson rebounding.\n\nAfter that though, there are a bunch of unknowns. Second-year pros Cory Trice Jr. and Darius Rush have GM Omar Khan and the Steelers' front office and coaching staff excited for what's ahead this season for the two young pieces, but they are massive unknowns at this point.\n\nRookie sixth-round pick Ryan Watts has great size and physical traits, but he might be better suited for safety than boundary cornerback. Undrafted rookie free agent Beanie Bishop Jr. might earn a role in the slot, but banking on him being a key contributor right out of the blocks is a stretch, too.\n\nEven \"veteran\" names like Thomas Graham Jr., Josiah Scott, Kalon Barnes and Luq Barcoo are considered options at corner, but those names aren't giving anyone a sense of comfort.\n\nSo, the position is a major need for the Steelers, just like receiver is. Even if that means circling back to Patrick Peterson this summer, or letting the legal process play out with Cameron Sutton and seeing what could be done there, the Steelers have to do something at cornerback to address the depth chart behind Porter and Jackson.\n\nRelated Items:Chris Simms, Chris Simms Unbuttoned, Donte Jackson, Joey Porter Jr., Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending Recommended for you

The Steelers were certainly going to draft a wide receiver, of course, but doing something and planning to do something is an important distinction. With Wilson in the building, Watkin's future with the team is more tenuous.\n\nA 2020 sixth-round draft pick, wide receiver Quez Watkins has spent his entire career on NFL 53-man roster, when healthy. Now on his second NFL team via free agency, however, he's in a vulnerable spot with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nPittsburgh doesn't even have a deep wide receiver room, but Watkins isn't a lock to make the roster. They traded Diontae Johnson, released Allen Robinson II, and lost Miles Boykin in free agency, but it feels like there's another shoe to drop.\n\nAnd it could drop on Watkins. Right now, the wide receiver room consists of George Pickens, rookie Roman Wilson, Calvin Austin III, Watkins, and Van Jefferson. Those are the most notable names, but they also have some veterans like Marquez Calloway and Denzel Mims in there.\n\nA third-round pick, Wilson stands a good chance of playing right away. Pickens is their WR1, and Austin is their punt returner, while Jefferson is arguably a better option. You have four wide receivers right there, and they're unlikely to carry more than five.\n\nSo you potentially have Quez Watkins competing with the field, which is likely to include one more significant name by the end of training camp. Their options for adding meaningful wide receivers feel like they're dwindling, but there's always a deal to make.\n\nEither way, Roman Wilson clouds Watkins' path to playing time even if the does make the roster. For starters, in an Arthur Smith offense, the only role I can see for Watkins is as a situational deep threat. He's not a nuanced route runner and gives variable effort, with non-existent blocking. Wilson is a high-energy route runner with an eagerness to participate in the blocking component.\n\nIf Watkins isn't even going to see the field, possible dress, then the doesn't need a spot on the 53. And I'm not convinced that, if release, he doesn't make it to the practice squad.\n\nAs the season progresses, Steelers players' stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year, with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications, particularly when players lose their jobs, or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions, whether minor or major.\n\nA bad game, a new contract, an injury, a promotion -- any number of things affect a player's value. Think of it as a stock on the market, based on speculation. You'll feel better about a player after a good game, or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor, while others are likely to be quite drastic, so bear in mind the degree. I'll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.\n\nRelated Items:Quez Watkins Recommended for you 2024 Pittsburgh Steelers Pre-Draft Movements - Wide Receiver Steelers 2024 Offseason Roster Rebuild Has Resulted In Cash Savings To Date Dulac: Steelers Already Added Their Vet Wide Receivers, 'Though Not The One They Would've Liked'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quez_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quez Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Smith_(American_football,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Smith (American football, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/QuezWatkinsEagles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Their second-round pick, Frazier offers the best combination of talent and experience in the 2024 NFL Draft class. He comes into the league having already played over 2,500 snaps at center, so he knows what the position demands.\n\n\"It's all about communication\", Frazier told Missi Matthews in an exclusive sit-down interview with the team's website. \"The center and the quarterback have to be on the same page. We have to know where the protection is, who's the Mike. Everyone just has to be on the same page so there's no miscommunications\".\n\nWhile NFL teams seem to devalue the center position -- only Graham Barton went in the first round, who can also play center, and the Las Vegas Raiders drafted Jackson Powers-Johnson in the second round to play center -- they have unique responsibilities along the offensive line.\n\nThe center, ideally, is your most cerebral player, though some of the center's typical tasks can be shared. They need to know the protections and to set them based on the looks the defense shows. They also have the mechanical matter of needing to be able to snap the ball and quickly block. But for Frazier, so much of it happens in the classroom.\n\n\"It's a lot of film study throughout the week\", he said. \"Also studying the game plan for that week, and then it's knowing the calls and communicating that across the line so everyone can hear me clearly. Even when it's loud, just so we're all on the same page\".\n\nFormer Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey helped start weekly offensive line meetings at his house. While they socialized, they also studied the offense, their opponents, and the position itself. Frazier has leadership qualities, but there's only so much you can do as a rookie.\n\nThe Steelers' offensive line now includes considerable pedigree. They have two young first-round tackles in Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu. Veteran guards James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are both former Day-Two picks. Most of them offer a good combination of intelligence and physicality.\n\nCan Zach Frazier exemplify that in the heart of the line? A state wrestling champion and obsessive note-taker, his background reads like a classic center. His college tape also certainly looks the part, but transitioning from college to the pros is always a projection.\n\nOne thing I'm confident about is that Frazier won't fail in the NFL due to a lack of effort or physical or mental acuity. He has the makeup that you look for in an offensive lineman, and a center specifically. That's always a good place to start, but that's exactly where we are: at the start.\n\nRelated Items:Missi Matthews, Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending, Zach Frazier Recommended for you Steelers Veterans Winners And Losers Of 2024 Offseason Kaboly: Russell Wilson Will Start All Of 2024 Barring Injury Fittipaldo: 'Unfair' To WR Roman Wilson If Steelers Expect Him To Start Right Away", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurkice_Pouncey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maurkice Pouncey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Seumalo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Seumalo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Zach-Frazier-Pittsburgh-Steelers-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Along with last year's first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023, it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick, few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.\n\nMason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth, or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect, McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts, it would appear that McCormick's fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?\n\nIn May of 2022, Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring, Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency, they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels, Seumalo, and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.\n\nJust a month after spending that money, the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft, they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson, like McCormick, was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior, as the Steelers had four players (Moore, Jones, Chuks Okorafor, and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.\n\nIt doesn't make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo, Daniels, Herbig, and Anderson already on the roster. It's highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle, Moore is the only one with a season's worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility, but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?\n\nMcCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook, Herbig, and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts, but Daniels is the only one who wasn't hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives, it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.\n\nBy the end of training camp, don't be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition, don't be shocked if McCormick's 57 starts at guard are the reason why.", "source": {"uri": "behindthesteelcurtain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Behind the Steel Curtain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_fox@behindthesteelcurtain.com", "name": "Tom Fox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderick_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broderick Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Seumalo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Seumalo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_State_Jackrabbits_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota State Jackrabbits football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Herbig", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Herbig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4TUIWPHrQU4gkqNmhH0E16RscrM=/0x578:6933x4045/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25434926/usa_today_22685645.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

He won't have to change his scheme either. In a sit-down interview with WQAD's The Score, Lee reacted by landing with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the team's sixth round pick of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\n\"Their base defense is a 3-4,\" he told News 8's Matt Randazzo. \"I would have the opportunity to play the 4i which I believe my skillset will be optimized for. In nickel packages, when they bring in sub-packages for third down opportunities, they'll run down more of a four-down front. I'll be able to play what I played at Iowa.\"\n\nThe Hawkeyes and Steelers' defenses are more similar than they are different. Lee's reference to the \"4i\" is the defensive end shaded to the inside shoulder of the offensive tackle, the typical Pittsburgh alignment in their base 3-4. That role has shifted over the years. A decade ago, the defensive end played more true five-tech, outside shade of the tackle, but has slid inside over the years. Now, this is how the team usually aligns.\n\nLee will battle for a backup role along the Steelers' defensive line. He'll compete with veterans Dean Lowry, Isaiahh Loudermilk, DeMarvin Leal, and Jonathan Marshall for one of the final spots on the 53-man roster or at the least, a practice squad spot. Lowry is likely to have an inside track on a roster spot, replacing Armon Watts, while Loudermilk finished the season ahead of Leal. A third round pick of 2022, Leal will need an impressive training camp that's better than his last one to make the roster. Marshall spent 2023 on the Steelers' practice squad but brings some NFL experience.\n\nFor Lee, he's excited to get started.\n\n\"It'll be somewhat in my comfort zone and it'll be in my skillset as well. The system, I couldn't have asked to be part of a better system.\"\n\nThough he faces longer odds to make the roster as a late-round selection, being familiar with the principles of the scheme will give Lee a leg up. While there will naturally be differences centering about verbiage and terminology, Pittsburgh should feel familiar to Lee. His motor and pursuit will endear himself to the coaching staff and if he prove to be a more well-rounded player than Leal, he might stick as the team's sixth defensive lineman.\n\nCatch the whole interview below.\n\nRelated Items:Logan Lee, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Renner: Steelers 'Went All In' On Arthur Smith's Offensive Vision With Draft Class Haul Albert Breer Confused By Analysts Wanting Steelers To Trade For Big-Name WR: 'Never Been' What They Do Eagles Signing Shon Stephens, Joey Porter Jr.'s Cousin Won't Attend Steelers Minicamp", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nickel defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiahh_Loudermilk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiahh Loudermilk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarvin_Leal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeMarvin Leal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Thundering_Herd_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marshall Thundering Herd football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Porter_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/StockLoganLee2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The Falcons were sixth in the NFL in average depth of target, which will play into what Russell Wilson does well. Wilson was third in the NFL in 2023 in passing yards on passes that traveled at least 25 yards downfield- he still has his deep ball.\n\nIn terms of how the Falcons distributed their targets, tight ends were the biggest beneficiaries. Atlanta led the NFL with 34 percent of their targets going to tight ends. Kyle Pitts and Jonnu Smith combined for 160 targets, and 103 combined receptions. For comparison, Pat Freiermuth averaged less than four targets per game in 2023. In totality, the Steelers only targeted tight ends 91 times last season. Being that Freiermuth is the only proven receiving threat at the position, he is going to see a big uptick in production. Freiermuth's career-high in receptions is 63, and he has a very good chance of topping that in an offense that will feature him more as a slot receiver.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean that George Pickens and whomever the potential new acquisition at receiver won't get looks. Drake London led the Falcons in targets with 110. The next two receivers on the target leaderboard were Mac Hollins (30) and Van Jefferson (28). That's another reason I'm not convinced the Steelers aren't making some sort of move. Jefferson is in Pittsburgh to run block and be the WR4 on the roster, not the second receiver. Overall, the Falcons were last in the NFL in target distribution to receivers at just 41 percent, which was 10 percent less than the Jets and Cardinals who were tied for second-to-last.\n\nBoth the Steelers and Falcons were amongst the league leaders in targets to running backs. The Falcons targeted running backs on 24 percent of targets and the Steelers did so on 23 percent. Jaylen Warren will be continue to be a name to watch in the passing game, as well. Bijan Robinson was the Falcons' third-most targeted player in the passing game with 58 receptions on 86 targets. Tyler Allgeier had 23 targets. I would bet that Najee Harris plays more of the Allegier role in the passing game where he doesn't see nearly as many targets as Warren, simply because being more of a dual-threat is more of Warren's game. For comparison, Warren had 74 targets last season, Harris had 38. In terms of run distribution, both teams were practically the same. The Falcons ran the ball 44 percent of the time, the Steelers ran the ball 43 percent of the time. So for everyone expecting there to be a big jump in total runs, it'll be roughly the same.\n\nIn terms of overall targets, Pittsburgh and Atlanta were roughly the same, as well. The Steelers' pass catchers combined for 484 targets, while the Falcons combined for 504. It's hard to put a true number estimate on targets for receivers at the moment, considering Pittsburgh is likely to add another name on the outside. However, I do expect more receptions for George Pickens, even if his targets slightly decrease from a season ago. A 70-75 reception season is definitely reasonable expectation, even with a potential new target opposite of him. If anything, that would help him. The same can be said for Freiermuth, who will be a go-to target in the offense.\n\nThe Steelers will have a more cohesive offense that has far more tweaks and variety than they've had over the last number of years under Matt Canada and Randy Fichtner. However they divvy up their targets, it's hard to imagine they won't be far more successful than they've been for half a decade.", "source": {"uri": "behindthesteelcurtain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Behind the Steel Curtain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jarrett_bailey@behindthesteelcurtain.com", "name": "Jarrett Bailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Freiermuth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Freiermuth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Pitts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Pitts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Warren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Allgeier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Allgeier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijan_Robinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bijan Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Fichtner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Fichtner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Or2tH1QASFuFxiBqcyNZeQCuLsE=/0x0:6944x3472/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435463/1699576919.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542485", "eventUri": "eng-9542485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

As calculated by Over The Cap's Jason Fitzgerald, the Steelers have only 62.5 percent of last year's roster returning. It's the fifth-highest turnover rate of any team in football. Or presented another way, 28th in roster retention.\n\nAs compiled by Fitzgerald, only the Washington Commanders, Los Angeles Chargers, Miami Dolphins, and Houston Texans have had more turnover.\n\nThe Commanders and Chargers have new regimes, head coaches and general managers, which typically go hand-in-hand with roster changes. Meaning the Steelers have the third-highest turnover of teams that retained their head coaches and front offices.\n\nOffensively is where Pittsburgh has seen the biggest changes, none more than its quarterback room. All three quarterbacks who populated the roster a season ago, Kenny Pickett, Mitch Trubisky, and Mason Rudolph, are gone. Pickett was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, Trubisky released and signed with the Buffalo Bills, and Rudolph a free agent who inked a deal with the Tennessee Titans. Elsewhere, starting WR Diontae Johnson was shipped to the Carolina Panthers.\n\nDefensively, the Steelers' front seven saw fewer roster moves but the secondary underwent turnover. Cornerbacks Levi Wallace, James Pierre, Chandon Sullivan, and Patrick Peterson are no longer on the roster. Wallace signed with the Denver Broncos, Pierre with the Washington Commanders, while Sullivan and Peterson remain free agents with the chance of one of them returning. Safety Keanu Neal was replaced by DeShon Elliott.\n\nSpecial teams saw plenty of churn too. Veteran punter Cameron Johnston replaced Pressley Harvin III while pure special teamers like WR Miles Boykin exited, though the team retained top ace Miles Killebrew on a two-year deal.\n\nA separate tweet showed the Steelers having 25 percent of last year's roster not currently on a 2024 team, also ranking as one of football's highest rates. As for the teams with high retention, the Green Bay Packers return over 80 percent of their players from a year ago. Around the AFC North, the Cincinnati Bengals lead the way with more than 75 percent of their roster intact. Fitzgerald's tweets also show high turnover in Baltimore while the Cleveland Browns aren't listed in his screenshots but likely fall somewhere in the middle of the pack.\n\nRelated Items:Jason

Powell was a first-team all-conference selection in the Northeast Conference last season after leading the Dukes with 713 receiving yards.\n\nHe also added nine touchdowns and had 20.97 yards per catch last season. He measured in at 6025 and 191 pounds while running a 4.72 40-yard dash. He transferred to Duquesne as a graduate transfer after four seasons at Bethune Cookman where he had over 900 receiving yards during his time at the school.\n\nPittsburgh's rookie minicamp will take place this Friday-Sunday, May 10-12 at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex. The Steelers already have a Duquesne alum on the roster, as LS Christian Kuntz attended the school. Powell will look to get signed to a Steelers team with a wide receiver room that has a decent amount of depth with Calvin Austin III, Van Jefferson, Quez Watkins, Dez Fitzpatrick and Marquez Callaway behind George Pickens and Roman Wilson, but no real standout option.\n\nLast season, Powell was sixth in the FCS with his 20.97 yards per reception, and scored a touchdown in seven games. He also had a catch in all 12 games and multiple receptions in nine games last season for Duquesne. He was one of two receivers in the Northeast Conference to have multiple touchdown receptions in multiple games.\n\nDwayne Menders, another Duquesne wide receiver, participated in Pittsburgh's rookie minicamp in 2023 but was not signed to a contract. Given Pittsburgh's depth at receiver, Powell may be facing an uphill battle to get a contract but his ability to work downfield makes him an intriguing add as Pittsburgh's continues to finalize their minicamp invites.\n\nRelated Items:DJ Powell, Duquesne Dukes, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Steelers' Depth Behind Joey Porter Jr. A Major Question For Chris Simms: 'Who Covers The Other Guys?'

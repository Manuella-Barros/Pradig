Andrew Harvey, Nationwide\u2019s senior economist, said, \u201cOur latest analysis suggests that average house price growth in local authorities classified as predominately rural has continued to outpace those of other areas.\u201d \u201cAverage prices in predominately rural areas increased by 22 percent, compared with 17 percent in predominately urban areas. Local authorities classified as \u2018urban with significant rural\u2019 saw price growth of 19 percent over the same period,\u201d added Mr. Harvey. He also highlighted that \u201caffordability pressures\u201d and a rise in \u201cborrowing costs\u201d saw a decline in average prices in both urban and rural areas in 2023. The data in the report was sourced from the UK House Price Index and covered the time period between December 2018, to December 2023. \u201cIn local authorities classed as \u2018predominantly rural,\u2019 more than half of the population live either in rural settlements or market towns,\u201d Mr. Harvey said. \u201cIn authorities classed as \u201curban with significant rural,\u201d between 26 percent and 49 percent of the population live in either rural villages or market towns. \u201cIn local authorities which are classified as \u2018predominantly urban,\u2019 at least 75 percent of the population are either in towns or cities,\u201d he said. Figures also included \u201ctourist hotspots\u201d such as Devon and the Lake District, which could include those buying holiday or second homes. The report outlined that of the 349 local authorities in Britain, 212 are classified as \u201cpredominately urban,\u201d 89 as \u201cpredominately rural,\u201d while the remaining 48 are classed as \u201curban with significant rural.\u201d As for the top performers, rural semi-detached properties saw the strongest price growth with average prices increasing by 24 percent. \u201cIncreased demand for property in rural areas over recent years has been part of the \u2018race for space\u2019 seen during the pandemic,\u201d Mr. Harvey added. Flexible working options made necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many people in urban areas to relocate during the above-mentioned time period. However, a think tank has found that London\u2019s population has begun to bounce back to record highs. The exodus of Londoners from the capital saw a 0.7 percent drop in population between mid-2019 and mid-2021. More than 75,000 people moved out of London during the time period, equivalent to the population of Tunbridge Wells. They reported that the majority of people leaving London moved to southeast England around the time of the pandemic. However, the outflow of people was at a \u201cmodest level,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe population dip during COVID was considerably smaller than the figures in the hundreds of thousands that some predicted,\u201d said Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities. What followed was an influx of 66,000 people moving to the capital by mid-2022, with the London boroughs of Camden and Tower Hamlets seeing a population increase that exceeded their pre-pandemic average. With record levels of immigration from abroad being factored in, London\u2019s population is most likely well above its pre-pandemic peak. The think tank said, immigration is \u201csignificantly exacerbating the housing crisis,\u201d putting pressure on the British rental market and social housing\u2013all which affects housing costs. \u201c\u2018For decades, we have failed to build enough new homes to meet demand from those already living in the UK and record net migration has only exacerbated the problem. The Government needs to deliver on its promise to bring migration down and do more to tackle the country\u2019s cavernous housing deficit by facilitating housebuilding right across the country\u2013greenfield and brownfield, urban and rural, north and south,\u201d said CPS research director, Karl Williams.", "summary": "A paradigm shift in housing has seen prices in British rural areas increase by 22 percent, outshining urban growth by 5 percent.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/rural-house-prices-beat-urban-growth-in-race-for-space-5658325", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/04/06/id5176051-GettyImages-521111912-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:22:58", "author": "Adam Brax", "authors": ["Adam Brax"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.053}

Indian and Pakistan are facing off at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday at Eisenhower Park \u2014 the biggest match of the ICC Cricket T20 Men\u2019s World Cup in the US. The cricket stadium is near the Hempstead Turnpike, and traffic is expected to be disrupted all day due to several nearby roadways closing for the match. The high-profile match, one of the most intense rivalries anywhere in sports, will also have heightened security, which will further snark traffic. An NYPD bulletin noted that the tournament and its related events in the Big Apple could be viewed by extremists as an opportunity for violence. \u201cRecent pro-ISIS propaganda which specifically referenced the upcoming India-Pakistan match at this major event \u2026 raises concerns and reinforces the need for heightened vigilance\u201d among security partners, the bulletin said. Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said the World Cup received an ISIS-K-linked threat in April as well as more specific threats related to the India versus Pakistan match. Cricket World Cup matches between India and Pakistan are among the most viewed sporting events in the world. The last time the two teams faced off in T20 cricket \u2014 a shortened version of the game \u2014 was in 2022. Gov. Kathy Hochul said New York State Police have been directed to increase enforcement presence and security for the tournament. Nassau County police have issued a traffic advisory, warning residents of several road closures taking place during the tournament. Park Boulevard (Eisenhower Park) will be closed in both directions from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. The park will also be closed to the public during the tournament. Merrick Avenue from the Hempstead Turnpike to Charles Lindbergh Boulevard will be closed between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., police said. During that time, only local traffic will be allowed from Stewart Avenue Southbound to Charles Lindbergh Boulevard. The Eastbound side of Charles Lindbergh Boulevard will be closed from Earle Ovington Boulevard from 4:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., while the Westbound side will remain open all day from the Meadowbrook State Parkway ramp, police said. James Doolittle Boulevard will be closed at Charles Lindbergh Boulevard from the Marriott main entrance from 4:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Hempstead Turnpike and Earle Ovington Boulevard will remain open in both directions.

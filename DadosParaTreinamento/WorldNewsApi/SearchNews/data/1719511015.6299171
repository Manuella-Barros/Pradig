Riyadh's new ambassador to Syria will be Faisal Al-Mujfel, SPA said. Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Syria earlier this year after the two countries cut diplomatic ties more than a decade ago. Syria reopened its embassy in Riyadh last year and appointed a new ambassador in December. The re-establishment of ties between Riyadh and Damascus marked the most significant development so far in moves by Arab states to normalize ties with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was shunned by many Western and Arab states after Syria's civil war began in 2011.", "summary": "", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-appoints-first-envoy-to-syria-in-more-than-a-decade/articleshow/110441641.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:22:40", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.067}

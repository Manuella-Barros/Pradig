Judge Juan Merchan denied both motions.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Day 14 of the Trump hush money trial:\n\nAnother day of contentious Stormy Daniels testimony\n\nDaniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair.\n\nTrump's attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter.\n\nShe noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies - questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt \"was so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?\"\n\n\"If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn't expecting to see there, yeah,\" Daniels responded.\n\nNecheles also asked how she described the encounter, pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her \"come here\" and they started kissing on the bed. He did say \"come here,\" Daniels said in response.\n\n\"You made all this up, right?\" Necheles said.\n\n\"No,\" Daniels responded.\n\nNecheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels' work as a writer of adult films. \"You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,\" Necheles asked.\n\nWow,\" Daniels said with a pause. \"That's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.\"\n\nProsecutors, defense spar over Daniels' financial situation\n\nBeyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump's attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation.\n\nNecheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she'd earned 1 million dollars and others where she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted.\n\n\"You're celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,\" Necheles asked.\n\n\"Not unlike Mr. Trump,\" Daniels responded.\n\nTrump's attorney also questioned Daniels about her \"Make America Horny Again\" strip club tour in 2018 - showing posters she had promoted - and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book.\n\nDuring re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers' fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost.\n\n\"On balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?\"\n\n\"Negative,\" Daniels said.\n\nFormer Trump aide describes inner White House operations\n\nFormer White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump's West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office.\n\nWesterhout was asked about a list of Trump's contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff - a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady.\n\nEventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump's work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, \"liked speaking to people in person or on the phone.\"\n\nAsked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn't cite a specific number. \"A lot,\" Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and \"late into the night\" after she had gone to bed, she testified.\n\nThe prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York.\n\nWesterhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution's narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017.\n\nWhen asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn't have and that she was \"very regretful of my youthful indiscretion.\"\n\n\"I've grown a lot since then,\" she said as she started crying.\n\nShe was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, \"Off the Record.\" Westerhout said she \"thought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.\"\n\n\"President Trump forgave you, right?\" Necheles asked. \"He did,\"\u202fWesterhout\u202fsaid. \"He was a really good boss.\"\n\nWesterhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels' account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, \"Madeline, it's past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?\"\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_del_valle@cnn.com",

Judge Juan Merchan denied both motions.\n\nDaniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair.\n\nTrump's attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter.\n\nShe noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies - questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt \"was so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?\"\n\n\"If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn't expecting to see there, yeah,\" Daniels responded.\n\nNecheles also asked how she described the encounter, pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her \"come here\" and they started kissing on the bed. He did say \"come here,\" Daniels said in response.\n\nNecheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels' work as a writer of adult films. \"You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,\" Necheles asked.\n\nWow,\" Daniels said with a pause. \"That's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.\"\n\nBeyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump's attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation.\n\nNecheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she'd earned 1 million dollars and others where she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted.\n\n\"You're celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,\" Necheles asked.\n\n\"Not unlike Mr. Trump,\" Daniels responded.\n\nTrump's attorney also questioned Daniels about her \"Make America Horny Again\" strip club tour in 2018 - showing posters she had promoted - and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book.\n\nDuring re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers' fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost.\n\n\"On balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?\"\n\nFormer White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump's West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office.\n\nWesterhout was asked about a list of Trump's contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff - a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady.\n\nEventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump's work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, \"liked speaking to people in person or on the phone.\"\n\nAsked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn't cite a specific number. \"A lot,\" Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and \"late into the night\" after she had gone to bed, she testified.\n\nThe prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York.\n\nWesterhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution's narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017.\n\nWhen asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn't have and that she was \"very regretful of my youthful indiscretion.\"\n\n\"I've grown a lot since then,\" she said as she started crying.\n\nShe was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, \"Off the Record.\" Westerhout said she \"thought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.\"\n\n\"President Trump forgave you, right?\" Necheles asked. \"He did,\"\u202fWesterhout\u202fsaid. \"He was a really good boss.\"\n\nWesterhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels' account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, \"Madeline, it's past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?\"\n\nTrump's lawyers asked Merchan both to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against him after Daniels was off the stand. The judge rejected both requests.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche asked for Trump to be allowed to publicly defend himself against Daniels' allegations, arguing the former president currently is forced to stay silent in response to the suggestion that there was a non-consensual sexual encounter between her and Trump.\n\nBlanche argued that Daniels has changed her story by suggesting that this \"completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual.\"\n\nYet, Blanche said, \"he is not allowed to say 'I did not do that'\" for voters who are seeing media coverage of the testimony.\n\nMerchan denied the request, saying he must protect the integrity of the proceedings and he doesn't trust Trump not to violate an order if he were to modify it.\n\n\"The reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks, the vitriol,\" Merchan said. \"These were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses.\"\n\n\"Your client's track record speaks for itself here - I can't take your word for it\" that Trump will stick to disputing the facts, the judge also said.\n\nMerchan also denied Trump's renewed motion for a mistrial over the salacious testimony Daniels gave that his attorneys say unfairly prejudices the jury against Trump.\n\nThe judge said Trump's outright denial of the incident and his legal team's attack on her credibility opened the door for prosecutors to bring in Daniels' testimony that turned salacious.\n\n\"The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels' story,\" Merchan said.\n\nMerchan pointed the finger at Necheles who opted not to object to several salacious lines of questioning that the defense later used as reasons the judge should declare a mistrial.\n\nBlanche argued that Daniels' testimony at trial was a new version of the alleged events - a point Merchan disagreed with.\n\nProsecutor Josh Steinglass said Trump was aware of the \"messy details\" of the encounter in 2016 and that shows motive for the hush money payment and cover up.\n\nBlanche argued that the level of detail prosecutors elicited from Daniels went too far. But Merchan said \"details like items in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture,\" add a \"sense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them,\" even as he acknowledged there were some details he would have preferred stayed out.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Trump is accused of reimbursing Cohen and concealing the payment as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and claims the case is politically motivated. This case is the first of Trump's four criminal indictments to go to trial. Trump also maintains his innocence in the three other cases against him.\n\nWhat We Know\n\nOn the 14th day of the Trump trial, Westerhout, who served as director of Oval Office operations in 2019 and remains a Trump loyalist, was called to the stand.\n\nWesterhout was fired from the Trump White House after she reportedly bragged to journalists at an off-the-record dinner that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Boulos (then-Trump). It was also reported that she told journalists that Trump did not like being photographed with Tiffany because he perceived her to be overweight.\n\nWhen asked about the dinner with reporters by the prosecution, \"she begins crying while talking about her regret for her 'youthful indiscretion,' Newsweek reporter Katherine Fung, who was inside the courtroom, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWesterhout said that she had learned a lot from that experience, before being asked about the 2020 book she wrote, Off the Record: My Dream Job at the White House, How I Lost It, and What I Learned, which describes Trump in a favorable light.\n\nFung reported that she began to sob again.\n\n\"I thought it was really important to share with the American people the man I got to know,\" she said through tears. \"I don't think he's treated fairly.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Westerhout", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madeleine Westerhout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loyalist (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Source (journalism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2390902/trump-westerhout.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=49bb7df824d9b430c5177c9ea8e86297", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555084", "eventUri": "eng-9555084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

In 2015, a photograph showing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in Brady's football locker went viral. At the time, Brady said \"It would be great\" if Trump were elected president, a statement he later walked back.\n\nTrump's contact list was revealed when former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout testified on Thursday in the former president's hush money case, where he is accused of falsifying business records in connection with a payoff to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who claimed she had a sexual encounter with him.\n\nWesterhout testified that she reached out to Trump's executive assistant, Rhona Graff, to get an updated contact list from the Trump Organization to use at the White House. Graff testified earlier in the trial that Trump kept contacts in the Trump Organization computer system for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe contacts, which had phone numbers redacted, were displayed on a video screen Thursday as an exhibit as Westerhout discussed its provenance and how she used it.\n\nThe list included names pertinent to the trial, including David Pecker and Michael Cohen, but also a few less expected contacts.\n\nPeter Ward, former president of the Hotel Trades Council\n\nMark Burnett, executive producer of NBC's \"The Apprentice\"\n\nAri Emanuel, CEO of Endeavor, an entertainment agency that owns the UFC and WWE\n\nJerry Falwell Jr., former President of Liberty University", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavor_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endeavor (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhona_Graff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhona Graff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Emanuel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ari Emanuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Burnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Burnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Falwell_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Falwell Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555084", "eventUri": "eng-9555084", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

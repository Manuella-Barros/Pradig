{"id": 239730110, "title": "JoJo Siwa brings good 'Karma' to joyous crowd at 23rd Chicago Pride Fest", "text": "When asked to characterize her performance at Chicago Pride Fest on Saturday, local drag queen Ebonii Michaels used the following description: \u201cenergy, combustion and spreading love.\u201d \u201cAnd sexiness, of course,\u201d she added. That description could easily apply to the overall event, which takes place at Halsted and Addison in Lake View, and continues Sunday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Now in its 23rd year, the fest typically attracts tens of thousands of people, and many packed the area on Saturday afternoon for performances on three stages \u2014 especially for headliner JoJo Siwa. (Natasha Bedingfield, the other main act, was scheduled to perform Saturday night.) Attendees, many dressed in rainbow colors and other bright attire, brought warm and friendly vibes to the fest, which featured about 150 food and merchandise vendors. They snacked on tacos, empanadas, Asian cuisine and Italian beef. Vendors sold clothing, tasteful erotica art, \u201ckinky earrings\u201d and decorative tumblers. But it wasn\u2019t just about having a good time, said Mark Liberson, who chairs the festival committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for the community to come together and celebrate, and also to continue to push towards securing rights for people who in our community are still being marginalized and not being welcomed into society fully as they deserve to be,\u201d he told the Sun-Times. Liberson also wants people to take note of the more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills being considered in state legislatures in the United States, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. He also pointed to the 17 transgender and gender-expansive people violently killed in 2024, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Providing a safe space for young people was also a priority for the fest, which included a Teen Pride Space. Olivia Thiel, 17, who lives in the South Loop, performed there Saturday. \u201cDuring non-Pride season, you can\u2019t really get into many gay spaces because of age,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s really important that teen drag queens can show off their drag to a larger audience because we\u2019re just stuck doing it in our bedrooms.\u201d Vendors such as Skokie-based The Twinkling Talisman also worked to create a welcoming space. \u201cI try to be as inclusive as possible,\u201d said owner Tiffany Price, who makes bracelets representing the colors of many LGBTQ+ flags. \u201cAs a queer woman of color, representation is everything, and I want everybody to feel as beautiful and as happy as they possibly can because this world can be an ugly place.\u201d Vero Mcculloh, 27, of Buffalo Grove ventured to the event in search of such an environment. \u201cIt\u2019s been a super-transformative year for me, and I feel like I have buckled down a lot in embracing my identity,\u201d said Mcculloh, who uses they/them pronouns. \u201cI feel really drawn to being around people like me, [but] who are all shapes, sizes, colors, generations, everything. That is not how it is in the suburbs.\u201d Mcculloh was also there to see Siwa perform her song \u201cKarma.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all over the internet, transcending over people\u2019s algorithms,\u201d Mcculloh said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s watching what. You\u2019re going to see it or someone imitating it.\u201d Siwa, 21, did perform \u201cKarma,\u201d and the crowd went wild when she did her signature dance, a mainstay on TikTok. During the high-energy show, the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and \u201cDance Moms\u201d alum took swigs from a bottle of Fireball and poked fun at some of the controversy surrounding her, including her previous comments about wanting to start a new \u201cgay pop\u201d genre, and accusations that she stole songs. After her performance, Siwa told the Sun-Times that she uses humor to deal with the criticism. \u201cI know my deep morals and deep values,\u201d she said. \u201cMy position on this earth is to entertain the world, and with that comes some messy territory, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d Having performed at several Pride events throughout the U.S., Siwa said Chicago was her favorite so far. \u201cThis one really did stand out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so entertaining for me onstage. I saw more posters dedicated to me and stuff for me.\u201d The crowd also responded to the drag performers, including Michaels, who sang to songs from Beyonc\u00e9 and Dua Lipa. Host Mz Ruff N Stuff \u2014 who was celebrating her 60th birthday\u2014 led crowd singalongs to songs by Miley Cyrus and Sabrina Carpenter with fellow queen Mimi Marks. A standout performer was Joan Jullian, who dazzled in a sheer bejeweled dress. Attendees audibly gasped at her beauty. Overall, the drag showcase was as diverse as the crowd, which Michaels said was a highlight of Chicago Pride Fest, along with the unity around a common purpose. It\u2019s a safe space for all walks of life,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/lgbtq/pride/2024/06/22/chicago-pride-fest-lgbtq-lake-view-jojo-siwa-natasha-bedingfield-drag-shows-dance-music-celebration", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3192748/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x4000+0+336/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F13%2Fe1%2Fe0d68de144bc82c2968313420c61%2Fprid", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:21:39", "author": "Erica Thompson", "authors": ["Erica Thompson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.601}

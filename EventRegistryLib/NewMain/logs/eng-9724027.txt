Just like this time a year ago, nobody is taking notice of the Orange and Black. But maybe they should be. Maybe, the Flyers improved more in the offseason than people realize.\n\nEven after adding Matvei Michkov to their season-ending roster and only losing Cam Atkinson, Denis Gurianov, and Marc Staal, the general consensus is that the Flyers won't be a very good team in 2024-25 despite just barely missing the playoffs last season -- they lost nine of their last 11 games, finishing five points out of a wildcard spot. While they haven't gone all out in the 2024 offseason, perhaps they didn't have to.\n\nWhile the Flyers were technically sellers in the 2023 offseason under new general manager (GM) Danny Briere, they quietly made their roster better. According to the on-ice stats, their two worst defensemen in the 2022-23 season were Ivan Provorov and Tony DeAngelo -- the former was traded for a haul while the latter was bought out.\n\nBy getting rid of their two worst on-ice defensemen, the Flyers turned into one of the best defensive teams in the NHL in 2023-24. Their goaltending regressed heavily, so they weren't exactly among the top teams in the league at keeping the puck out of their net, but the Orange and Black gave up few scoring chances as a whole. Without making any major additions to their roster other than getting Sean Couturier and Atkinson back from injury the season prior, they had successfully gone from the seventh-worst team in the league to almost making the playoffs -- this really wasn't by accident.\n\nIn the 2024 offseason, the Flyers are doing the exact same thing. Their defense was great, but the offense could use some work -- that's where the changes begin. Atkinson was one of their worst players all season in 2023-24 and he was bought out, while the addition of Michkov should serve to bump two other struggling veteran forwards down or completely out of the lineup: Scott Laughton and Nicolas Deslauriers.\n\nCombined, those three played 48.7 percent of the Flyers' ice time in 2023-24, meaning they had a pretty sizable role with the team. Atkinson being gone obviously decreases that number, while Deslauriers doesn't really seem to have a spot at all -- he played 60 games last season. The only player that we can expect to play consistently is Laughton, but he was sixth in ice time among forwards on the team -- that number should go down, too.\n\nBut just how bad were those three? Surely, they couldn't have brought the Flyers down that much. Well, the numbers paint a different picture. When looking at expected goals for per 60 (xGF/60), expected goals against per 60 (xGA/60), expected goals percentage (xGF%), Corsi percentage (CF%), and plus-minus at 5-on-5 action, the difference between Philadelphia with those three and without them is certainly noticeable.\n\nWhen we only include the Flyers' minutes without Laughton, Atkinson, and Deslauriers last season, their numbers are some of the best in the NHL. At 5-on-5, we have to go all the way up to third in the NHL standings with the Carolina Hurricanes (111 points) to find the best comparison -- the advanced numbers are pretty similar:\n\nThe stats here speak volumes. Without their \"junk\" minutes per se, the Flyers were up there with one of the best teams in the NHL. Relentlessly dominating in terms of puck possession and scoring chances, the Orange and Black were incredible despite their lack of talent.\n\nWhen we isolate Laughton, Atkinson, and Deslauriers, the numbers are far less pretty. The best team comparison out there is the Columbus Blue Jackets, who finished with 66 points and fourth-last in the league standings. The difference in the numbers is staggering:\n\nThis night-and-day difference is what made the Flyers a bit frustrating last season. They were a different team when these three players were on the ice, but there was really nothing they could do about it. Now, with Michkov on the team and Atkinson out of the picture, it doesn't have to be like this.\n\nThe Flyers used other depth players like Bobby Brink and Olle Lycksell in place of Deslauriers at the end of last season, while Laughton only got bumped up the lineup because of the struggles of Couturier and Morgan Frost -- he probably won't play ahead of them after such a disappointing campaign. Even Ryan Poehling could play ahead of him at times, so there might be a lot of internal change in 2024-25.\n\nTo hammer home the Flyers' differences with and without these players, let's go to another table. Since we can expect Laughton to stay and likely still get some decent minutes in, eliminating him from the equation is less accurate than if we just got rid of Atkinson and Deslauriers. Even still, the numbers are vastly different from when those last two are off the ice versus when they are on it:\n\nThe closest team comparison without Atkinson and Deslauriers' minutes is the Florida Panthers, while the closest team comparison solely with their minutes is the Anaheim Ducks. The two took up 32.4 percent of the Flyers' ice time at 5-on-5, so there was a pretty profound impact given how much they were playing.\n\nLaughton undoubtedly had the worst season of his career in 2023-24, so we should actually expect him to be a little bit better. With that in mind and adding a superstar prospect to the mix, the Flyers upgraded their roster more than some might think. The addition-by-subtraction model isn't always obvious on the surface, but it tends to be if you look a little bit deeper.\n\nNow, this isn't to say that the Flyers will be one of the best teams in the NHL in 2024-25 -- that is probably not going to happen. Heck, they might not even make the playoffs, and you'd be right to doubt them at least a little bit. But the important thing to note is that Philadelphia got better from their 87-point team, and it's more significant than it appears.\n\nNow, this information would be somewhat misleading if we didn't mention the loss of Sean Walker at the trade deadline. Dealt for a 2025 first-round pick by Briere, it was a move that we knew from the start could derail the season. Ultimately, it did -- he was arguably Philadelphia's best defenseman and they didn't acquire an adequate roster player to replace him.\n\nHowever, all hope might not be lost. Walker played a large majority of his ice time with 31-year-old defenseman Nick Seeler, and for good reason -- their results together were tremendous. This is where 22-year-old Jamie Drysdale comes in.\n\nDrysdale, acquired by the Flyers on Jan. 8, 2024, had a difficult time adapting to the Flyers' style early on -- there are several explanations for this. He was battling injury throughout his 2023-24 campaign and even missed time with an injury that eventually needed surgery during his tenure with the Orange and Black. As well, he was the youngest player on the team, playing a tough position and without enough time to really understand how to play in their system.\n\nRelated: Flyers Were the Perfect Destination for Jamie Drysdale\n\nThe numbers as a whole were pretty awful for Drysdale, but that wasn't the case when he took Walker's role and played with Seeler. In fact, his numbers were actually fairly good, especially when both he and Seeler recovered from their respective injuries during the month of March. With all of our other stats as well as time on ice (TOI) included, here are the numbers:\n\nWe shouldn't hold the poor plus-minus rating against Seeler and Drysdale, mainly because of how horrendous the Flyers' goaltending was toward the end of the season -- the other numbers contradict the plus-minus, anyway. While the 22-year-old Drysdale wasn't a direct replacement for Walker, there is certainly a world where that can be the case moving forward. The potential here is through the roof.\n\nDespite being put into this impossible situation, Drysdale showed some chemistry with Seeler. With an actual offseason to prepare and hopefully no more ailments bothering him, we could start to see the youngster soar under the veteran's wing. If that does end up being the case, the Flyers should not only return back to where they were last season but possibly rise above that.\n\nDrysdale's biggest asset is his talent, which gives him a potential edge over Walker. His numbers might not be as good, but his skating ability and offensive instincts are elite, while his defensive play has an upside but is still a work in progress. If the youngster can start to figure out his game a bit, we can see a strong Flyers team in 2024-25.\n\nNow, there's always the possibility for Seeler's regression, which makes this a two-man game. However, under head coach John Tortorella, the 31-year-old has been great for a couple of seasons now. He had a 4.42 relative xGF% (xGF% Rel) in 2022-23 at 5-on-5, which was second among Philadelphia defensemen with at least 100 minutes of ice time. Last season, his 3.55 xGF% Rel at 5-on-5 ranked third on the team among defensemen, meaning he didn't really progress or regress. Only increasing his average ice time by 1:04, we can confidently assume that Seeler is the real deal -- he is no longer just a fluke. There is always the possibility that he will get worse in 2024-25 or suffer a long-term injury, but the implication here is that this is unlikely.\n\nAgain, all of this does not mean that the Flyers are guaranteed to make the postseason. What it does say is that they did legitimately improve their roster. Briere didn't make any splashes in the offseason, but the reality is that he is doing the same exact thing that set up his team's surprising campaign in 2023-24. This time, he's working with an 87-point club, not a 75-point one.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The tour started Tuesday in North Wildwood and continues Thursday at Excursion Park in Sea Isle City. The tour is meant to build excitement and connect with fans as the Flyers' season approaches.\n\n\"That is so special for me (giving back to his hometown),\" said Hilferty, an Ocean City native and 1974 St. Augustine Prep graduate. He has a summer home in town and attends Hermits' sporting events.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This week was street hockey. Hilferty, who used to work at the camp and played on the same playground there, loved coming back for a second straight summer.\n\n\"I love being in the area,\" added Hilferty, who grew up a Flyers' fan.\n\nThe young campers got an hour to themselves to enjoy the caravan before the actual event started. The caravan included many games like a street hockey rink, slap shot target and much more.\n\nCurrent Flyers players Jamie Drysdale, Tyson Foerster and Joel Farabee and former players Dave \"The Hammer\" Schultz, Bob \"The Hound\" Kelly, Brian Propp, Scott Hartnell, Brad Marsh and Doug Crossman interacted with campers and signed autographs, as well as those fans that came in later. Beloved mascot Gritty was also there greeting fans.\n\n\"To have fellow Ocean City residents line up and meet current Flyers players and then get to meet our stars of the past and engage in a fun day, it's all part of our mission,\" Hilferty said. \"To not only grow the game and grow a young fanbase who are Flyers fans, but also give back to the community. And we want to do it with all communities. But now that it's my hometown, I am extra excited about it.\"\n\nKelly said Hilferty is \"a quality person.\"\n\n\"Since he took over, he kind of revitalized what the Flyers are all about,\" Kelly said. \"He instilled a lot of stuff where we all work together and help each other out. He's a great leader. We are very proud and happy to have him with us.\"\n\nJaci Adams was one of those young fans. She attended the camp Wednesday wearing a Flyers jersey. The 11-year-old Ocean City resident said she loves the team and was excited to be at the event.\n\n\"It's really fun to watch (these) players,\" Adams said.\n\nAnd why is she such a big Flyers' fan?\n\n\"I like that they are actually like a team, like, they actually help each other,\" Adams said.\n\nKate Swayze has been a camp counselor for five years, and has seen the Flyers' caravan in Ocean City many times. She said she is \"an all-around Philly sports fan,\" and enjoyed seeing the kids' smiles just as much as being a part of the fun.\n\n\"It's so amazing to watch the team grow and that team environment they create really inspires kids to want to be on a team and play the sport and be physical and get tough,\" said Swayze, 19, who lives in Pennsylvania but vacations in Ocean City.\n\n\"The community caravan always does a great job. Every year gets better and better. I love that they are interactive with everybody. It really shows they care.\"\n\nKelly, who scored the winning goal to help the Flyers capture the Stanley Cup in 1975, has been doing the caravan for a long time, and enjoys every minute. The Flyers' legend said the team always treated him well and that \"it is important to give back.\"\n\n\"We really enjoy giving back,\" Kelly said. \"If we have the opportunity to help out and give back, that's what we should do. And it pays dividends.\"\n\nFoerster said he wished an event like the caravan would have happened when he was growing up in Ontario, Canada.\n\n\"Unfortunately it didn't happen,\" the 22-year-old said. \"But just to be here and see all these little kids having a blast. It's a lot of fun for us and a lot of fun for them.\"\n\nFarabee also participated in the caravan last summer, and said he \"was excited to be back.\"\n\n\"It's great,\" he said. \"I think it's awesome to have an event like this in the summer. It's special for Flyers fans and the community. It's great to get the turnout we have. We love being here.\"\n\nRebuild starting strong\n\nThe Flyers are a young team aiming to rebuild and bring back the Stanley Cup to Philadelphia for the first time since the 1974-75 season. Under general manager Danny Briere, the Flyers went 38-33-11 this past season and were very close to securing a wild card spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\n\"We had such a young team this past year,\" Farabee said. \"It's great. Each year you get older and more experienced. I think it's going to be good for us.\"\n\nThe Flyers look very promising with young players such as Foerster, Drysdale, Farabee, Owen Tippett, Travis Konecny, Bobby Brink and many others. Matvei Michkov, their seventh overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft, recently signed with the team. He projects to be a top-line winger.\n\n\"They over-performed, as far as I am concerned,\" Hilferty said. \"But what I am excited about is, if you start with hockey leadership (Flyers' general manager Danny Briere, president of hockey operations Keith Jones and coach John Tortorella), they consistently said we will be patient and do this the right way. Over time we will build a great franchise.\"\n\nKelly said Hilferty and the rest of the management \"have done a good job.\"\n\n\"I think they made good strides,\" Kelly said. \"I think they did better than what they thought they would do.\"\n\nPlayers like Drysdale, Foerster, Farabee and Michkov are some of \"the young cornerstones.\"\n\n\"The build will continue and we are excited about it,\" Hilferty said. \"It will take time, but fans should be excited.\"\n\nFoerster said he has not set any expectations for this upcoming season. The Flyers' season-opener is 10 p.m. Oct. 11 at the Vancouver Canucks.\n\n\"But I am just trying to play my game and do what the coaches ask of me, \"he said. \"But I am looking forward to it.\"\n\nContact Patrick Mulranen: 609-272-7217\n\nPMulranen@pressofac.com\n\nTwitter @ACPressMulranen\n\nCan't get enough High School sports?

News of his official signing on July 1 was the biggest news (outside of Hathaway's extension) the Flyers of that day. It doesn't make the Flyers a Stanley Cup contender come October by any stretch, but it does make the consternation of \"will he\" or \"can he\" end up playing for the Flyers at some point in the rearview mirror. It is happening.\n\nHere then are 39 reasons (an appropriate number, of course) why Matvei Michkov coming over is a very good thing for the Flayers, er, Flyers.\n\n1. The Flyers have a 19-year-old, franchise-altering forward on their roster, someone DobberProspects deemed \"a generational goal scoring talent.\" The last time the Flyers had someone so young and talented was June 30, 1992 when Eric Lindros was deemed property of the Flyers and not the New York Rangers after Lindros refused to sign with the Quebec Nordiques.\n\n2. The Flyers notoriously have been terrible in shootouts, often losing a handful of points each season for the simple fact that can't score. With such a talented young player in Michkov at their disposal, it's conceivable the Flyers could end up faring at a .500 winning percentage (or better) if 65 minutes of play has not determined a winner and loser.\n\n3. Having Michkov here now will more than likely allow some of the other players in the pipeline a bit more time (and space) to develop. This will be Michkov's spotlight at least for this season and possibly beyond. All of a sudden Oliver Bonk and Denver Barkey don't quite have the glare or external pressure to be forced into a situation where they aren't quite ready. Not that Briere would do that, but having a possible phenom here now is massive.\n\n4. Matvei Michkov and Flyers coach John Tortorella will have plenty of time to get to know and love (and possibly loathe) each other with Michkov's entry-level deal for three years and Tortorella now most likely going to have a full two seasons with Michkov under his guidance. I'm not sure what the Russian phrase for \"bag skate\" is but I'm sure Michkov will be well informed of it when training camp begins in September.\n\n5. The \"Mad Russian\" also takes some pressure off the younger guys who are on the team now. Tyson Foerster, Bobby Brink and particularly Morgan Frost should relish the fact they will most likely not be the forwards who everybody and their dog overanalyze on a game-by-game or period-by-period basis.", "source": {"uri": "broadstreethockey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Broad Street Hockey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_macneil@broadstreethockey.com", "name": "Jason MacNeil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matvei_Michkov", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matvei Michkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Michkov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dmitri Michkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lindros", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Lindros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bri\u00e8re", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Bri\u00e8re"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Nordiques", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quebec Nordiques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foerster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Foerster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Frost", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tortorella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Tortorella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Rave", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Rave", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.broadstreethockey.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/USATSI_20963670_168390100_lowres.jpg?fit=2400%2C1468&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724027", "eventUri": "eng-9724027", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 242, "textEnd": 248}, {"amb": false, "date": "1992-06-30", "textStart": 906, "textEnd": 919}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Recapping a perspective on both the good and the bad of his tenure as GM, where should he stand in Flyers lore?\n\nAfter former GM Bob Clarke resigned following a disastrous start to the 2006-07 season, Holmgren was thrust into a difficult position. Eventually finishing with the worst record in the league despite making the playoffs every season from 1994-2006, he was faced with two options: he could give up on the core and rebuild or show his confidence in his players and build around them. Ultimately opting for the latter, he set up a fun era for Flyers hockey.\n\nDespite finishing with the worst record in the league, the Flyers were only treated to the second-overall pick when the prize of the class was one of the best American players in NHL history, winger Patrick Kane. Even with that unfortunate luck, Holmgren built his team around forwards Mike Richards, Jeff Carter, and Simon Gagne -- he was pretty successful in doing so.\n\nIn the 2007 offseason, Holmgren didn't miss on a single one of his gambles. He traded just a single late first-round pick for Scott Hartnell and Kimmo Timonen, instantly upgrading his top-six and acquiring one of the best defensemen in franchise history. Still, he wasn't done there. Signing the biggest fish in free agency, Danny Briere, to an eight-year deal, Holmgren reinvented the Flyers' roster -- they were instantly shot into contention.\n\nBoth Carter and Richards became stars in 2007-08, while Briere was a worthwhile addition to the offense. The Orange and Black clinched the postseason with 95 points versus 56 from the season before, completely flipping the script. In the playoffs, they went on a magical run that led to a berth in the Eastern Conference Final. A team led by a couple of young players, the Flyers looked like a team that might be competitive for years to come.\n\nThe Flyers once again made the playoffs in 2009, and that's when they started to see the development of a young Claude Giroux on their roster. He was one of their best players in the postseason as a 21-year-old rookie, but it wasn't enough to return back to where they were a season before. Then, the team's run to the Stanley Cup Final occurred, thanks to a splash to land future Hall of Fame defenseman Chris Pronger in the offseason.\n\nThe Orange and Black qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the 2009-10 regular season, finishing as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Overcoming the New Jersey Devils, a 3-0 series deficit to the Boston Bruins, and a hungry Montreal Canadiens team, the Flyers returned to the Final for the first time since 1997. While they ultimately fell to the Chicago Blackhawks in a hard-fought series, it was an incredible run that made hockey in Philadelphia interesting again.\n\nThe Flyers never returned to the Stanley Cup Final, but they made the playoffs in three of Holmgren's last four seasons as GM. He failed at winning a championship, but he turned a rather poor situation into an accomplished tenure. With a 307-234-73 record (.559 points percentage) and six playoff appearances in eight total seasons, Holmgren was successful with the hand he was given. Aggressive when necessary and the winner of most of his trades in terms of a value standpoint, that's worthy of some praise.\n\nIt was certainly impressive that Holmgren and the Flyers had such a quick turnaround after 2006-07, but that might have been his sign to enter a rebuild. Instead, he entered a retool -- it limited Philadelphia's upside. Trying to find an immediate solution to a myriad of issues including not having a deep enough prospect pool, the result was just a few seasons of success and then a decade of the least successful hockey in team history after that.\n\nIn the end, even Holmgren's best Flyers teams were just not good enough to compete with the juggernauts during that era. This first started in the 2008 postseason when the Orange and Black went up against a young Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin in the Eastern Conference Final. Philadelphia had a 47.9 Corsi percentage (CF%), a 44.1 expected goals percentage (xGF%), and was outscored 14-5 at even strength in their series with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Clearly, the two teams weren't very close -- they only grew further apart over time, with Pittsburgh winning the Stanley Cup in 2009 partially due to a first-round win against the Flyers.\n\nIn the Flyers' appearance in the Stanley Cup Final in 2010, they were also just not as good of a team as the Blackhawks. Not only was that arguably Chicago's most stacked on-paper roster of the three championships they won from 2010-2015, but they outplayed Philadelphia, too. With a 47.5 CF%, 48.9 xGF%, and being outscored 20-16 at even strength, it is evident that the better team won.\n\nWe can always look back and think about if a few things changed, but the reality is that the Flyers did not have the talent required to win the Stanley Cup -- they had a worse even-strength xGF% than their opponent in all but one of their playoff series from 2008-2010. They did have a couple of great runs, but pretty much everything went right for them to happen in the first place. Since the run to the Final, it has been a downward spiral for the Orange and Black even with Giroux's emergence in 2010-11 and the team achieving their best record in the regular season since 2002-03. Swept in the second round by the Bruins, they were still short of being in the conversation with the NHL's best.\n\nAfter that sweep, that's when Holmgren's approach got somewhat strange. Right as Giroux was starting to blossom into something, that's when Holmgren decided to completely alter the roster around him. Looking back, he probably should have gone all-in for the budding superstar -- Pronger and Timonen, the Flyers' two best defensemen, were both in their mid-30s entering the 2011-12 season. Instead of giving Giroux a team to win with, he opted to downgrade his roster instead of upgrade it.\n\nTrading Richards and Carter away for a cumulative package that most notably included Jakub Voracek, Sean Couturier, Brayden Schenn, and Wayne Simmonds, you'd probably think that Holmgren won this trade on paper. However, the Flyers had an evidently minimal window to win a Stanley Cup that completely faded the second that deal was made. With the extra cap space, Holmgren signed goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51 million contract to upgrade from rookie netminder Sergei Bobrovsky -- we'll get back to this later.\n\nRelated: Flyers' 7 Richest Contracts in Franchise History\n\nWhile the Flyers were a great team in 2011-12, they suffered a monumental loss that ended essentially any hope of a championship -- Pronger suffered a career-ending injury. Giroux finished fourth in Hart Trophy voting and scored 14 points in six games in the first round of the postseason against the Penguins, but it was only enough to delay their inevitable playoff exit -- they fell to the Devils in five contests.\n\nFollowing that playoff run, everything fell apart for the franchise. Their short window of opportunity slipped away very quickly, with two of their only three defensemen (Pronger and Matt Carle) with a positive relative xGF% (xGF% Rel) in 2011-12 not playing another game for Philadelphia. Even with the continued growth of players like Voracek and Simmonds the following season, Giroux was unable to carry the load with some of the worst goaltending in the league led by Bryzgalov who was bought out that offseason -- Bobrovsky, who was traded to make room, won the Vezina Trophy.\n\nThe 2013-14 season was Holmgren's last as a GM before he became President and then a Senior Advisor. He had one more chance to take the hint that the Flyers just weren't good enough to compete for a title even with Giroux at his peak, but he instead gave a five- and six-year contract to Vinny Lecavalier and Andrew MacDonald respectively -- the former struggled and was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, while the latter was bought out. This semi-aggressive approach may have been influenced by then-80-year-old owner Ed Snider, who earned the right to not oversee a rebuild -- he sadly passed away in 2016. Regardless of who initiated the approach, it did not set the Flyers up for future success.\n\nInstead of potentially being a great team by this point, the Flyers were mediocre at best. While Holmgren was gone in 2014-15, his impact was still being felt. Philadelphia had no depth, no true first-pairing defensemen on their roster, and had one of the worst prospect pools in the league. Ron Hextall did not do a great job as the next GM, but he was put in a difficult situation and somewhat unsurprisingly failed. He suffered from a lot of indecisiveness, but his case was not helped by his predecessor.\n\nWhile the answer as to whether Holmgren was a good or poor GM for the Flyers is up to perspective, there were undeniably some positives and negatives to his tenure. Even though he hasn't been the GM in a decade, the impact of his time is still being felt today -- Briere, who he signed, is now serving in his old role.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com",

Mandatory Credit: David Kirouac-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWe've now had some time to process the first round of the NHL draft that took place at the end of June, and the Flyers' (slightly) off-board selection of Jett Luchanko. For some of us, that distance has been a good thing and, upon reflection, tracks with how Brent Flahr-the Flyers' \"draft guru\"-makes his selections.\n\nGiven how some of his other choices have panned out, perhaps him and the rest of the scouting department deserve some leeway to make draft choices that leave us amateurs scratching our heads. With that in mind, let's look at how the Flyers' first-round picks since Flahr joined the organization in 2019 are looking.\n\nTwo things to note before we begin: first and foremost, it is way too early to make judgements on some of these players, especially the ones who have yet to play meaningful NHL minutes, or even any NHL minutes at all. Second, drafting isn't always about choosing the player who will have the most immediate impact; it's about selecting the one with the most potential in the future. That means that some picks will look baffling in the moment, but savvy some years down the line.\n\nAh, the first-and most infamous-choice of the Flahr era: Cam York over Cole Caulfield. If you look at just the box stats, it's not great: in 205 career games, Caulfield has 81 goals and 149 points to York's 15 goals and 60 points in 169 games. Under the surface though, things get a little more fuzzy.\n\nAt 5-on-5 over the course of a season, not once has Caulfield posted a positive Corsi-For percentage (CF%); his highest was 48.9 CF% over 46 games in his injury-riddled 2022-23 season. York, meanwhile, posted a just barely positive 50.3 CF% in this recent 2023-24 season-a steady improvement from the 46.8 CF% he had in 30 games in 2021-22 and 48.6 CF% in 54 games in 2022-23 (the latter while playing his off side, opposite Ivan Provorov). It's worth noting, too, that Caulfield's PDO was a hair above average the last two years at 101.1 and 102.4, respectively, while York's was 100.7 and a rough 96.0.\n\nIn the moment of the draft-and the years that followed-York over Caulfield looked like a glaring mistake. However, as York has developed, that choice is looking better and better. Another good year from York, and we might be able to describe that pick as, at worst, basically even; at best, it was prescient, but we still need more time to figure that out.\n\nThis is a weird draft to analyze, given that it happened in the midst of a global pandemic, but we're going to do our best! The Flyers were hot off their best playoff showing in nearly a decade, and haven't made it back since. With their 23rd overall pick they selected Tyson Foerster, a prospect with a promising shot but abysmal skating. That skating, along with pace questions, severely dinged his draft stock, with many scouts ranking him solidly in the 2nd-round despite the enviable tools. The Flyers taking him in the 1st round was a bit of a stretch.\n\nWell, with Foerster's rookie season finished, the Flyers may get to rub everybody else's noses in it: he might be a stud two-way winger in the mold of Mark Stone. Foerster's scoring wasn't there to start 2023-24, but he turned it on in the second half, scoring 14 goals over the final 42 games to finish with 20 goals and 33 points, and a sterling 54.4 CF% at 5-on-5. If that scoring pace continues next season, Foerster could sniff 30 goals-and if he maintains those excellent defensive metrics, look out. Not bad for a projected 2nd-round pick going in the early 20s.\n\nSigh. Moving on.\n\nOf course the Flyers' first top-five pick since Nolan Patrick is also no longer with the organization. We still have to talk about Cutter Gauthier, though.\n\nGauthier was a late riser in the 2022 draft, though many still had him outside the top ten-and certainly not in the top five (full disclosure: I was pulling for David Ji\u0159\u00ed\u010dek the way the board unsurprisingly fell). Well, two years on and it looks like Gauthier may've been the correct pick at five after all. He has one NHL game to his name and had an assist in his debut, as well as solid underlying metrics-though it's a one-game sample size, so that doesn't prove much.\n\nIt's still way too early to know what the Flyers lost in Gauthier-and what they may have gained in Jamie Drysdale-but one thing is clear: ignoring the drama, reaching for Gauthier at fifth overall might've been the right call.\n\nMatvei Michkov is a top-of-the-draft prospect, potentially No. 1 overall in any draft that doesn't include Connor Bedard-him falling to the Flyers at seven was a no-brainer.\n\nThe more divisive pick is Oliver Bonk at 22nd overall when Gabe Perrault-part of one of the most productive USNTDP lines in the league's history-was staring them in the face. Passing on Perrault for Bonk was highly criticized at the time: Bonk was described as a high-floor/low-ceiling two-way defenseman with a clear path to the NHL and projected as a late first/early second round pick; Perrault projected to go high in the first as a top-six left wing with elite hockey sense and serious power play utility, but fell into the 20s.\n\nFor all that consternation of Bonk over Perrault (in the same vein of York over Caulfield), it looks like the Flyers recognized something in his game no one else did. In his D+1 season on a London Knights team that went to the Memorial Cup Final, Bonk put up 24 goals and 67 points in 60 regular season games, plus another seven goals and 16 points in 18 playoff games. Now, that offense is unlikely to translate as a pro (unless the Flyers use him in the bumper on the power play which, at this point, given how bad the man advantage is, why not?), but it is far more than anyone would've expected the day he was drafted.\n\nMuch like the 2022 selection, it's far too early to determine if Bonk was the right choice-neither him nor Perrault have played NHL games-but it might look like less of a reach than we all thought at the time.\n\nAnd now we have the Flyers' most recent 1st-round choice: Jett Luchanko. This was a pick that no one saw coming, as Luchanko was projected to go in the late-teens at the earliest and maybe even the tail end of the 1st round. To get him, the Flyers traded back one spot to pass on highly-rated defense prospect Zeev Buium and then passed on the last of the projected \"top picks,\" Konsta Helenius. Needless to say, we all lost our collective minds over this criminal over reach and lamented the death of the rebuild.\n\nExcept, maybe not? After sitting with the selection for a day, I came around on it-and it was the Bonk pick in 2023 that made me realize that, hey, maybe the Flyers scouts see things we don't, because they may've nailed that reach. In Luchanko's case, he missed the cutoff for 2025 draft eligibility by less than a month; he also tested top five in every physical trial he was put through at the scouting combine as one of the youngest prospects there. Luchanko has nearly an entire extra year of developmental runway compared to his peers, and is already ahead of most of them physically-we can't ignore those factors in the Flyers' selection.\n\nAgain, though, it's way too early to tell-though he did impress in his first development camp last week-but we should all give him a couple years before passing judgement, just as we have had to do with Cam York. After all, scouting and drafting is about listening to and trusting your scouts-not the consensus-and choosing the player who's going to be the best in several years.

And the only hockey we will be watching until the fall (unless you are a sicko and are going to watch the World Juniors Summer Showcase) has already happened with the Flyers' development camp wrapped up over the weekend.\n\nBut we are still on standby for something the Flyers might do. And why is that? Well, this team is currently above the salary cap by approximately $830,000.\n\nThankfully, the Flyers don't need to add any more players. That number is with their two restricted free agents in Bobby Brink and Egor Zamula signed to new, two-year deals, and totally maxing out their roster room with 23 players that breaks down to 14 forwards (this includes Ryan Johansen, who will not be playing), seven defensemen, and the two netminders. So, at least the current team-wide cap hit won't increase at some point this summer.\n\nDuring the summer, teams are allowed to exceed the cap ceiling by 10 percent. The Flyers aren't even close to hitting that limit, but they will need to get that number below the $88-million mark before they drop the first puck of the regular season on October 11.", "source": {"uri": "broadstreethockey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Broad Street Hockey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_williams@broadstreethockey.com", "name": "Thomas Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIHF_World_Junior_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IIHF World Junior Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Johansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Johansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.broadstreethockey.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2023/11/USATSI_21937496.jpg?fit=2530%2C1687&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724027", "eventUri": "eng-9724027", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-11", "textStart": 1397, "textEnd": 1407}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Other notable names in the Flyers' system might soon be knocking on the NHL door after a bit more time in juniors or college, too, while others are going to need more reps and minutes to figure things out.\n\nAnd the goalies like Carson Bjanarson and Yegor Zavragin? Well, they'll probably be the very last to fully develop and break through as goalies often are.\n\nBut as a means to gauge how close, or how far, the numerous Flyers prospects are to possibly reaching the NHL, here's a look at the organization's draft classes from the past six years, along with each pick's current team, level, and contract status...\n\n* Give this class a few years. Luchanko will have the cloud of being a reach at 13th overall over him for a while, but still only 17, he already has excellent skating and vision that he makes good use of across all 200 feet of the ice. Gill is a big, lanky, and physical defenseman who presents a promising project to Sam Morin and the Flyers' player development staff over the next several years. Likewise, Berglund is a big, puck-controlling/protecting center who is developing a solid all-around toolkit, but will need to work on his skating in the seasons to come. And Powell is a hard-skating power forward who is heading off to Ohio State for a bit, but can definitely flash some offensive skill himself.\n\n* Bonk looked like a much more complete and smarter defenseman in development camp, and while he's more than likely looking at one more year in London, he might not be all that far off. \"He looks like he's played pro hockey already,\" Riley Armstrong, the Flyers' director of player development, said last week at camp.\n\n* Barkey, the other piece to the London duo, is likely headed back to the Knights, too, but this time with another (arguably better) shot at making Canada's World Junior roster after his offense spiked from missing the cut last year.\n\n* Ciernik verified during camp that concussions were what took away a huge chunk of his season last year, but the Flyers are still big fans of his game and are hoping that a bounce-back season in Sweden this year will set the stage for a jump over to North America - presumably to start playing in the AHL with the Phantoms.\n\n\"You watch him in drills, he's got an elite skillset as far as his edges, his hands, his ability when he has time and space, he's got the puck on a string,\" assistant GM Brent Flahr said on Saturday. \"I think he's at a younger stage in his game. He's gonna hopefully have success this year and grow his gameplay with the Elite League, have success, and then bring him over. He has a longer path. We knew that when we drafted him, but he's got lots of tools to work with, for sure.\"\n\n* Gauthier happened. He's in Anaheim now. A year has already burned off of his entry-level contract just from playing one game last season with the Ducks. It's what it is at this point.\n\n* Bump had a big freshman season at Western Michigan with 14 goals and 36 points through 38 games, and after three development camps since he's been drafted, Flahr seemed very impressed with how far the 20-year old winger has come.\n\n\"I look at players at different levels who have been here a number of times before but a guy like Bump, for me, every year he's been here you see a dramatic improvement,\" Flahr said Saturday. \"He looks like an NHL player to me going forward. He's an exciting guy.\"\n\nHe just can't sign until his college career wraps up.\n\n* It's no secret: The Flyers really like McDonald as a big, stay-at-home, throwback-type of defenseman. He'll have a spot on the Phantoms this year, and whether he makes the move up to the NHL sooner or later will probably come down to how well his skating and speed of decision-making develop.\n\n\"He's a throwback,\" Nick Schultz, the Flyers' assistant director of player development, said last week. \"You see kids now, I think we lack the physicality around our net and playing hard in the corner, that just comes natural to him. That's the way he plays... He plays hard. He makes it hard on forwards cutting to the front of the net, in the corners, and I think the difference from him from maybe the old-school D like that is that he can skate. He's an unbelievable skater.\"\n\n* Tuomaala definitely has the makings of a great winger. The 21-year old can fly up and down the ice, and snap off a lightning-quick shot before you can even blink. He just still needs to figure out how to wrap that all together into a consistent package. He had it in stretches last season on the way to scoring 15 goals and 43 points for the Phantoms, but did slump down the stretch of the regular season. He's likely looking at more reps in the NHL.\n\n* Kolosov is signed and did come over late last season from Belarus to join the Phantoms, but went back home for the summer and has stayed there since. The 22-year old netminder wasn't at development camp, and what exactly his situation is isn't entirely clear. GM Danny Bri\u00e8re and the organization have been holding to the position that Kolosov will return to play for the Phantoms this season. However, that doesn't exactly feel certain.\n\n* Foerster earned a full-time NHL role last season and netted 20 goals, even while he was sticking to a defense-first approach. He's a Flyer, and will be an important one moving forward. Former GM Chuck Fletcher hit on this one, but when it came to preserving picks or at the very least maximizing their value in trades between here and in 2021...yeah, not so much.\n\n* Andrae made the team out of camp last season, but was quickly overwhelmed by the pace of NHL play and got sent down to the Phantoms for steadier minutes and reps. The 22-year old Swede can be an effective puck-moving defenseman, but just needed time to adapt to the pace of the North American game and the dimensions North American-sized rink. He might still need more for this coming season, but it stands to reason that another NHL look for him will open up soon.\n\nMORE: How Jett Luchanko's speed makes him 'a special player' and key to the Flyers\n\n* York has developed far enough along to be a top-pairing defenseman alongside Travis Sanheim, and he's still growing when it comes to his game. Brink made the team out of camp last year, needed to go back down to the AHL for a bit, but then came back and has shown flashes of some effective offense - he also just re-upped on a two-year deal. And Attard has been on the NHL/AHL bubble for a bit now, but did get time with the Flyers toward the end of last season and could make a push to stick to the roster with a good training camp in a couple of months.\n\nSo that's one regular defenseman, a winger who can hang in the NHL but is still finding his footing, and one more blueliner looking for that last breakthrough. Not too bad, but the back half of the 2019 Flyers draft class ended up a wash.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehigh_Valley_Phantoms", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lehigh Valley Phantoms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Armstrong_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riley Armstrong (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-way contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Michigan_Broncos_men's_ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Ice_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elite Ice Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Schultz_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Schultz (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Fletcher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Fletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bri\u00e8re", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Bri\u00e8re"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Sanheim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Sanheim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/Bonk_Camp_1.5e2e44eb.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724027", "eventUri": "eng-9724027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

There are some avenues they can take to be cap compliant for the upcoming season. [BSH]\n\n*Gritty has blessed us once again.

But the goaltending and the group of defensemen -- really the backbone of this team -- is going to be an interesting group of players who should show some sign of development throughout the next 82 games. [Inquirer]\n\n*Oh, here we go. The only thing that really needs to happen across the NHL is some big-name restricted free agents signing some new contracts.

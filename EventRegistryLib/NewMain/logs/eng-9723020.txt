The evening before, MSNBC had broadcast a story detailing claims from the whistleblower, Dawn Wooten, a former nurse at the ICE facility.\n\n\"The guy has a pretty clean record,\" Scholl said of Amin in the conference call. Scholl added that Wooten \"has no direct knowledge of this stuff\" and \"kind of has a beef,\" though he did not elaborate.\n\nDespite Scholl's concerns, Hayes, Maddow, and Wallace aired several segments about Wooten's allegations on their evening MSNBC programs, sparking a Senate investigation into Amin's activities.\n\nOn her top-rated MSNBC show, Maddow quoted a detainee as saying, \"When I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp.\" Maddow went on to say, \"The nurse says she and her fellow nurses, quote, questioned among ourselves like goodness he's taking everybody's stuff out that's his specialty, he's the uterus collector ...

The liberal cable network spent much of President Trump's tenure pushing the debunked Trump-Russia collusion narrative, including in dozens of segments on Maddow's program. MSNBC settled a defamation lawsuit from Nicholas Sandmann after the network aired more than a dozen segments about the Kentucky high school student's confrontation with a Native American activist at the National Mall in 2019. MSNBC employees accused Sandmann of a \"hate crime,\" among other allegations.\n\nNBC News's involvement in reporting the \"uterus collector\" story began with a Sept. 15, 2020, article by Ainsley, a homeland security reporter, Soboroff, who covers immigration issues for NBC News and MSNBC, and Danielle Silva, an NBC News national reporter who covers immigration and education. The NBC News journalists obtained Wooten's whistleblower complaint and spoke with her for the story. Their story stated that \"women are routinely being sent to a gynecologist who has left them bruised and performed unnecessary procedures, including hysterectomies.\"\n\nBut emails and text messages revealed during the lawsuit's discovery phase show the reporters had lingering doubts about Wooten, and about how many women underwent hysterectomies.\n\nSoboroff wrote in one text message that an immigration attorney he spoke with offered \"mixed feelings\" about Wooten.

Hayes said he initially \"discounted the whole thing\" when he saw whistleblower allegations circulate on social media. Nevertheless, he interviewed Wooten on his show on Sept. 15, 2020, in a segment entitled \"ICE whistleblower speaks out, alleges mass hysterectomies performed on migrant women.\"\n\nHayes teased the interview with Wooten as \"shocking whistleblower allegations of atrocities at an ICE detention center including forced hysterectomies on women who don't need them.\"\n\nIn a conference call with Hayes the following day, Scholl, the MSNBC standards executive, acknowledged they still had no idea whether Wooten's claims were accurate, and whether or not Amin was a \"a good doctor or a shitty doctor.\"\n\n\"We don't know the facts here,\" Scholl said.

While CNN is facing a $1 billion defamation suit for allegedly slandering a security contractor, MSNBC was on the receiving end of a $30 million defamation suit for allegedly doing the same to a Georgia gynecologist who was seeing illegal immigrants at the direction of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). And in this instance too, the judge found that a jury could potentially find \"actual malice\" on MSNBC's part.\n\nAccording to Judge Lisa Godbey Wood's order for the case to go to trial (no trial date has been set yet), plaintiff Dr. Mahendra Amin \"has presented sufficient evidence that could enable a jury to find actual malice\" because of extensive internal communications and notes from MSNBC hosts, producers, reporters, and Standards and Practices folks questioning the report even before going to air.\n\n\"A jury could also conclude that NBC did not act with actual malice given the evidence that it published opposing information. This duel of conflicting evidence must be resolved by a jury,\" Wood added.\n\nThe suit stems from a series of on-air reports conducted between September 15 and 17 of 2020. In their reports, MSNBC reporters Julia Ainsley and Jacob Soboroff and hosts Nicolle Wallace, Chris Hayes, and Rachel Maddow parroted a letter of unverified whistleblower claims that Amin was abusing female illegal immigrants he was seeing as patients, performing unnecessary hysterectomies, and that he was known as the \"uterus collector.\"\n\nBut while they took that reporting to literal prime time, internal discussions at the network showed skepticism of what they were saying.\n\nIn an email to Soboroff and Ainsley, the senior deputy of NBCUniversal's Standards and Practices, Chris Scholl had deep concerns about the validity of the report, evening noting that all the information they had came from one source he admitted had \"an agenda\":\n\nAs I've been mulling, my concern is all we have is a public whistleblower complaint in which she provides no evidence to back up her claims. ICE makes essentially the same point, and it appears a valid one. She has no direct knowledge of what she's claiming, is unable to name the doctor involved (if I understood correctly), and we are unable to verify any of it or determine whether there really is a story here. Essentially, it boils down to a single source -- with an agenda -- telling us things we have no basis to believe are true. At the least, we would have to note all of that in our reporting, but then it's worth asking why we are reporting it in the first place. I think we need more of our own independent reporting before going with this. ICE's statement alone doesn't get us there.\n\nIn a conversation that included Hayes, Scholl admitted: \"We don't know if [Amin] did anything wrong here . . . . In fact, the guy has a pretty clean record.\" Adding: \"And the whistleblower has no direct knowledge of this stuff . . . . [S]he kind of has a beef, right? She's got a whole separate agenda here.\"\n\nHayes said the quiet part out loud in that \"the reason it went viral\" was because it \"conjured the worst kind of like Third Reich, . . . sort of . . . Jim Crow, Mississippi Hospital history.\"\n\nEssentially, it fit perfectly into the narrative they had painted about the Trump administration and it's immigration policies.\n\nHayes admitted all of that, \"is not the case here.\"\n\nMaddow also had expressed concerns about the story in a production meeting and was unsure they should give it airtime on her show:\n\nIn a preproduction meeting, a producer for the show said that the \"hysterectomy part [of the whistleblower letter] is largely based on [Wooten] and anon[ymous] accounts.\" Id. at 3. Maddow commented that there was \"a lot of jumping to conclusions around the complaint . . . I don't want to assume it's true[,] but if it is we should definitely do it.

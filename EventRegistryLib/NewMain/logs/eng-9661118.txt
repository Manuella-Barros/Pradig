You can check out at any time. More info\n\nControversial music mogul Scooter Braun, who famously feuded with Taylor Swift, has announced his retirement from music management. Braun said in a lengthy 1,400-word statement that he will \"cherish every moment\" of managing world-renowned artists.\n\nIn his 23-year career his client roster has included the likes of Justin Bieber, Kanye West and Ariana Grande. But the 42-year-old found himself the centre of a dispute with Swift in 2019, after he acquired Big Machine Records, where Swift had recorded her first six albums, before she signed a new record deal with another label.\n\nThe acquisition meant Braun became the owner of work copyrighted by Big Machine - including Swift's masters (original sound recordings). That in turn meant anybody who wanted to licence any of her back catalogue of music for a film or TV show would have to get Braun's permission - and pay him a fee.

Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and 'earn' one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta [CEO of Big Machine Records] would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.\" For the latest Cardiff news, sign up to our newsletter here\n\nThe controversy was highly publicised and saw Swift re-record four of her albums over two years, renaming them 'Taylor's Version', so she could gain full ownership of her music. Later in August 2023, reports emerged other artists - including Demi Lovato, Grande and Idina Menzel - had cut ties with Braun's management.\n\nNow Braun, 42, has cited wanting to focus on his family - namely his three children - as a motivation for his decision. He added he is moving on to serve as the CEO of HYBE America, a subsidiary of the South Korean entertainment content platform. He claimed he has \"nothing but love\" for the musicians he has worked with - even the artists who have distanced themselves from him to \"spread their wings\".\n\nThe news of his retirement, which comes on the eve of Swift's hugely anticipated gig in Cardiff, has delighted her fans, affectionately known as Swifties. Reacting to the news one fan account wrote: \"And nothing but loud cheers were heard across the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reem_ahmed@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Reem Ahmed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Machine Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scooter Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ariana Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennium Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybe_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybe Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Borchetta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Borchetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idina_Menzel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idina Menzel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Lovato", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demi Lovato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article13091930.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_scooterJPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661118", "eventUri": "eng-9661118", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 1357, "textEnd": 1366}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

'For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead, I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and \"earn\" one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in.'\n\nShe explained she always wanted to own her own music, but entered the music world at the age of 15 and couldn't fight for herself.\n\nWhile performing at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, the singer, 34, performed a mashup of her two diss tracks I Forgot That You Existed and This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things\n\nThe choices immediately sent Swifties into a frenzy as they rushed to social media to point out the performance came on Braun's 43rd birthday, and just one day after he announced his retirement from the music industry\n\nAt the time, Swift said the purchase was a betrayal from her old label and never in her 'worst nightmares' did she 'imagine the buyer would be Scooter.'\n\n'Any time Scott Borchetta has heard the words 'Scooter Braun' escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to. He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn't want to be associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever,' she wrote.\n\nThe performer who ended her post saying 'sad and grossed out.'\n\nNearly a year and a half later, Braun went on to sell the master recordings for more than $300 million to private equity company Shamrock Holdings.\n\nAt the time, Swift wrote in a social media post: 'My team attempted to enter into negotiations with Scooter Braun. Scooter's team wanted me to sign an ironclad NDA stating I would never say another word about Scooter Braun unless it was positive, before we could even look at the financial records of BMLG (which is always the first step in a purchase of this nature).'\n\n'So, I would have to sign a document that would silence me forever before I could even have a chance to bid on my own work,' she explained. 'He would never even quote my team a price. These master recordings were not for sale to me.'\n\n'I forgot that you existed x this is why we can't have nice things on scooter's birthday and first show post his \"retirement\" is HYSTERICAL,' one X user wrote\n\n'ON SCOOTERS BIRTHDAY?!?!' another tweeted\n\nA third wrote: 'Y'all... I Forgot That You Existed x This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things is ICONIC on the heels of the Scooter retirement announcement omg'\n\nOthers joked Swift, who also performed a mashup of I Hate It Here and The Lakes, was a 'comedian'\n\nSwift then announced she would re-record the songs on the six albums she made for Big Machine, calling them 'Taylor's Versions,' which she has already begun with both Fearless and Red.\n\nEarlier this week, Braun, who has had a prolific two-decade career overseeing the likes of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, announced his retirement from music management.\n\nBraun released a statement announcing the end of his 'chapter' as music manager - as he sets forth on his new role as a board member of Hybe and CEO of Hybe America.\n\nHis statement began: '23 years ago a 19 year old kid started managing an artist named Cato in Atlanta, GA and my journey began. Along the way I have had so many experiences I could never have dreamt of.\n\n'I have been blessed to have had a \"Forrest Gump\"-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking \"how did I get here?\" And after 23 years this chapter as a music manager has come to an end.'\n\nBraun infamously was embroiled in controversy with Swift after the music mogul purchased her master recordings from Big Machine Records CEO Scott Borchetta back in 2019 (pictured in 2024)\n\nNews of Scooter's retirement comes after he lost clients such as Grande, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Demi Lovato.\n\nScooter, who shares three children with his ex-wife Yael Cohen, cited his kids as the primary reason he decided to leave the business.\n\n'My entire adult life I played the role of an artist manager on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And for 20 years I loved it. It's all I had known. But as my children got older, and my personal life took some hits, I came to the realization that my kids were 3 superstars I wasn't willing to lose. The sacrifices I was once willing to make I could no longer justify. It was time to step into a new role.'\n\nBraun then addressed his next career move - as the CEO of Hybe America last year. Variety reported last year that Braun became sole CEO of the company.\n\n'In this next chapter, I have been honored to join as a board member of Hybe and serve as the CEO of Hybe America. My brilliant partner these past 3 years, Chairman Bang, has a vision I truly believe in. But even beyond that he has become a true friend who understands where I must be in my life these days. And that is a father first, a CEO second, and a manager no more.'\n\nEarlier this week, Braun, who has had a prolific two-decade career overseeing the likes of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, announced his retirement from music management (seen in 2018)\n\nHe reflected on his incredible career working alongside some of the biggest names in music, including Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.\n\n'Justin and Ariana were both young teenagers when I began with them,' he wrote. 'To see them both come up to be the legends they are today will forever be one of my greatest honors. As we change our working relationships now, I will continue to root for them with the same passion that I did at each of their humble beginnings.\n\n'I remember the pranks and the water park shows with Justin, and the first time Ari opened an arena tour and her excitement side stage. I remember as they both stepped up for others and I got to witness them each change the world and make history. There will never be a day where I don't take great pride and honor in what we accomplished together. The same can be said for so many I have had the pleasure of once being called \"manager.\"'\n\nBraun's statement also alluded to controversies he faced during his time as music manager, however he did not specifically name them.\n\n'There has been a lot said about what is happening in our company... and in my career. When we had success I smiled, and when we were attacked I tried to always take the high road.\n\nIn a June 2019 Tumblr post, Swift expressed her disappointment over the high-profile transaction (her full Tumblr post pictured here)\n\n'But for the last 3 years I have begun to feel that taking the high road has created confusion and ambiguity as to who we are. I may have left my role in management, and my business relationship with many clients will alter and change, but this does not mean we as a company are leaving.\n\n'Both Allison Kaye and Jennifer McDaniels are more than capable to lead and as we combine new resources the opportunities with their leadership are endless. These two incredibly powerful women will now step into a role that I know will grow into the most impressive women-led management business our industry has even seen. While my name may have been on the door all these years, the truth is there is no one as brilliant as Allison Kaye, and few who can manage with the grace and poise of Jen McDaniels.'\n\nHe continued: 'We at Hybe will continue to grow. With the addition of QC to Hybe America and our existing business at Big Machine, we will continue to add amazing execs and artists to the roster. Our WeVerse platform and growing gaming unit is something the whole industry can celebrate and join. Getting the opportunity to A&R and Executive Produce the solo career of Jung Kook last summer, and work with the other members of BTS as we break worldwide records, has been an absolute honor.\n\n'With new acts like NewJeans, TXT, LE SSERAFIM, Seventeen, ILLIT, The Scarlet Opera, Ava Max, and many other new artists and ventures, the future is bright. I'm honored to join Chairman Bang and Jiwon Park as we grow HYBE from the multi-billion dollar publicly traded company it is today to the worldwide multifaceted entertainment platform it is destined to be. With Hybe going strong I am also looking forward to continuing to invest in a new generation of entrepreneurs and serve as a national board member of Make A Wish and help individuals and communities through our family's Braun Foundation. Between all of this and coaching my kids I'm not worried about being busy :).'\n\n'So yes, it's been 23 years. And yes, this chapter has come to an end. But the great Berry Gordy once told me \"young man, it never ends the way you wanted, but it doesn't mean it didn't happen.\" That wisdom has proven to be correct. I never saw how this chapter would end, hell, I never even saw it happening. But it did. And I will cherish every moment of it. I made my plan... but it turns out I like God's plan better.

Discover when and how to watch Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood below.\n\nThe anticipated two-part docuseries delves into the feud between the billionare pop star and the veteran music executive. In 2019, Swift's first six albums were bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings after Braun acquired the singer's former label, Big Machine Records, in a $300 million deal.\n\nSwift asserted that she was never consulted on the deal and, therefore, never given a chance to buy back her catalog. \"This is my worst case scenario. This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term 'loyalty' is clearly just a contractual concept,\" Swift penned on Tumblr at the time.\n\nThe singer continued, \"Now Scooter has stripped me of my life's work, that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.\"\n\nIn 2020, Ithaca Holdings sold the rights to Swift's masters to Shamrock Capitol for $300 million -- the same amount it was reportedly acquired for. To recclaim ownership of her life's work, Swift started re-recording her first six albums in 2021 under a new partnership with Republic Records and Universal Music Group.\n\nSo far, Swift has released re-recorded versions of Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version), and 1989 (Taylor's Version), and has two more to go -- Reputation and her debut album.\n\nIn 2022, Braun told NPR that he wished the Big Machine acquisition was done differently. \"The regret I have there is that I made the assumption that everyone, once the deal was done, was going to have a conversation with me, see my intent, see my character and say, great, let's be in business together.\"\n\nThe upcoming Max special will feature legal experts, journalists, and individuals close to Swift and Braun to explain the situation. Other installments in WBD U.K.'s \"vs\" series include Johnny vs Amber, Kim vs Kanye: The Divorce, and Vardy vs Rooney: The Wagatha Trial. Discover how to watch Taylor Swift Vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood below.\n\nTaylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood will have two 60-minute episodes. The docuseries will be in the \"vs\" format, with each segment focusing on each side of the debate.\n\n\"True to the 'vs' format, the two episodes will examine the opposing sides of the argument; one exploring Swift's side that the sale was conducted without consulting her and that she has since been blocked from buying back her masters, and the other examining Braun's allegations that Swift refused to negotiate and instead incited a public feud by pitting her fan base against him,\" the logline reads.\n\nTo watch the Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood documentary in the US, you'll need to sign up for a Max subscription.

you listen to Taylor Swift or not, you've probably heard that she's re-recording and re-releasing all of her original records.\n\nThe reason she's doing this has a lot to do with a long-standing feud between Taylor, CEO Scott Borchetta, and now-retired music manager Scooter Braun.\n\nHow did the beef between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun start?\n\nThe complications between Braun and Swift began partly due to a man named Scott Borchetta.\n\nBorchetta owned Big Machine Records, with whom Taylor first signed as an artist when she was 15 years old.\n\nTaylor was Big Machine Records' first client, and many other popular artists followed in her footsteps.\n\nTaylor decided after her sixth studio album, Reputation, to sign her future music with Republic Records and Universal Music Group.\n\nThey'd made her a deal that she would own all her future masters, which Borchetta hadn't done.\n\nTaylor left Big Machine Records on seemingly good terms with Borchetta until mid-2019.\n\nIn June 2019, Braun purchased Big Machine Records for $300 million, which included the masters of the first six of Taylor's albums: Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation.\n\nTaylor alleged that Scooter Braun had bullied and manipulated her for years, including through his client Kanye West's release of the song Famous.\n\nWhat caused the beef to escalate between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun?\n\nAs with all beef, there are multiple moving parts to this story.\n\nIn August 2019, Taylor announced on Good Morning America that she'd be re-recording her albums, which her contract would allow her to do beginning in 2020.\n\nIn November 2019, Taylor Swift was named Artist of the Decade at the American Music Awards, where she wanted to play a medley of her music, including many songs from her first six albums.\n\nShe claimed that Borchetta and Braun wouldn't approve it and also, that they wouldn't approve her use of recordings for her 2020 Netflix documentary, Miss Americana.\n\nBorchetta and Braun ultimately said they'd allow Taylor to play some of her songs if she agreed not to re-record the albums and stopped talking about them to the press.\n\nTaylor asked her fans for help, and through the power of social media, the duo finally agreed to let her sing her songs live as long as Braun was still in charge of her masters (meaning where and when any of her recordings or visuals were used).\n\nTaylor showed up to perform wearing an oversized white shirt with the names of her first six albums written on it.\n\nHow did Taylor Swift react to Scooter buying her masters?\n\nAfter the acquisition, Taylor wrote a letter to her fans on Tumblr.\n\nShe said that she had been trying to get Borchetta to buy back her music for years and that instead, he'd only offered her deals, including repurchasing one of her existing records with a future release.\n\nShe wrote: \"I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future.\"\n\n\"I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past.\"\n\n\"Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.\"\n\nWho owns Taylor Swift's albums now?\n\nTaylor announced in August 2019 that she had plans to re-record her old music, which she would then fully own.\n\nAs of June 2023, Taylor has re-released four of her original six albums, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, and 1989, all of which have been distinguished as 'Taylor's Version.'\n\nLawyer and YouTube sensation Leeja Miller explained how Taylor can re-record the music if it's technically owned by someone else.\n\nLeeja said: \"So because she's the songwriter, she still owns copyright in that music; she just doesn't own the copyright to that particular version of the song.\"\n\n\"So she can now go on and re-record these songs on her own and own the masters on them, and then she'll have ownership of the new recordings.\"\n\nIn addition to re-releasing her first four original albums, Taylor has released five studio albums since her beef with Borchetta and Braun began: Lover (2019), Folklore (2020), Evermore (2020), Midnights (2022), and The Tortured Poet's Department (2023).\n\nThe pop star, who is now dating NFL star Travis Kelce, is also traveling the world on her international Eras Tour.\n\nThe Eras tour is slated to end on December 8, 2024, after 152 shows.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"},

Taylor had penned a scathing post over the sale of her masters to Scooter, and called him an \"incessant, manipulative bully\". This also informed the decision of the pop singer to release re-recorded versions of her six albums in order to take control over her music.\n\nReacting to Scooter's retirement, a fan wrote: \"Reputation Taylor's version announcement tonight!\" A second fan wrote, \"I haven't seen the TL this united by someone's downfall since Queen Elizabeth's passing like this man is universally hated.\" A comment read, \"And I'll say GOOD RIDDANCE!\" \"Karma's a relaxing thought!\" read another comment.\n\nMeanwhile, last month Variety reported that Taylor's feud with music producer Scooter will be explored in the docuseries commissioned by Warner Bros.

Keeping track of what went on between Swift and Scooter Braun isn't easy, but let's start in July of that year.\n\nThe complicated drama became public that summer when the 10-time Grammy winner penned a Tumblr post in response to the news that Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, acquired Big Machine Records, Swift's former label, for a whopping $300 million. The acquisition encompassed all aspects of Big Machine's business, including the rights to Swift's first six albums, all of which are multiplatinum: Taylor Swift (2006), Fearless (2008), Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017).\n\nSince then, a lot has happened. People took sides. Lawyers and publicists got involved. Calibrated responses were crafted and posted. Petitions went viral. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nSwift claims to be \"sad and grossed out\" that Braun owns her music.\n\nOn Tumblr, Swift described Bruan, who has worked with artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, and Demi Lovato -- as an \"incessant, manipulative [bully].\"\n\n\"When I left my masters in Scott's hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell them,\" Swift wrote. \"Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine the buyer would be Scooter.\n\n\"Scooter has stripped me of my life's work, that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy,\" the \"You Need to Calm Down\" singer said, adding that Scott Borchetta, the founder of Big Machine Label Group who discovered Swift at Nashville's famed Bluebird Cafe in 2004, knew about her disdain toward Braun and still went through with the acquisition. A detailed explanation about the acquisition (and more on if Swift can actually get the rights to her music back), here.\n\nSwift claims she can't play her songs at the American Music Awards and Netflix can't use them in a documentary.\n\nThe singer planned to perform a medley of her biggest hits later this month at the AMAs, where's she's being honored as Artist of the Decade. She wrote on Twitter that Borchetta and Braun will not work with her privately to find a fair way forward so that she can sing her own songs. She claimed Netflix, which is working on a Swift documentary, can't use any of her old songs. She also called on the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm (which, according to Business Insider, \"played a key role in the sale of Swift's back catalogue to Braun\") for help. \"Don't know what else to do,\" Swift wrote in the caption of her tweet with screenshots of her tweet.\n\nGuys, it's been announced recently that the American Music Awards will be honoring me with the Artist of the Decade Award at this year's ceremony. I've been planning to perform a medley of my hits throughout the decade on the show. Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun have now said that I'm not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year.\n\nAdditionally -- and this isn't the way I had planned on telling you this news -- Netflix has created a documentary about my life for the past few years. Scott and Scooter have declined the use of my older music or performance footage for this project even though there is no mention of either of them or Big Machine Records anywhere in the film.\n\nScott Borchetta told my team that they'll allow me to use my music only if I do these things: If I agree to not re-record copycat versions of my songs next year (which is something I'm both legally allowed to do and looking forward to) and also told my team that I need to stop talking about him and Scooter Braun.\n\nI feel very strongly that sharing what is happening to me could change the awareness level for other artists and potentially help them avoid a similar fate.\n\nThe message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished.\n\nThis is WRONG. Neither of these men had a hand in the writing of those songs. They did nothing to create the relationship I have with my fans. So this is where I'm asking for your help.\n\nPlease let Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun know how you feel about this.\n\nScooter also manages several artists who I really believe care about other artists and their work. Please ask them for help with this -- I'm hoping that maybe they can talk some sense into the men who are exercising tyrannical control over someone who just wants to play the music she wrote. I'm especially asking for help from The Carlyle Group, who put up money for the sale of my music to these two men.\n\nI just want to be able to perform MY OWN music. That's it. I've tried to work this out privately through my team but have not been able to resolve anything. Right now my performance at the AMA's, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November of 2020 are a question mark. I love you guys and I thought you should know what's been going on.\n\nTaylor\n\nBig Machine Label Group responded. Then Swift's publicist fired back.\n\nA spokesperson for Big Machine Label Group (Swift's former record label now owned by Braun) said the singer is misrepresenting the situation. The organization posted a statement to its website.\n\nAs Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information. At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\n\nThe truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career. We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward. We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.\n\nTaylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness, and support waiting for you on the other side. To date, not one of the invitations to speak with us and work through this has been accepted. Rumors fester in the absence of communication. Let's not have that continue here. We share the collective goal of giving your fans the entertainment they both want and deserve.\n\nSwift's publicist Tree Paine responded in a statement posted on Twitter, writing: \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, [sic] an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nMany of the Swift's famous friends have voiced their support.\n\n\"My heart is so heavy right now,\" Selena Gomez wrote on Instagram Story. \"It makes me sick and extremely angry. (I don't mind if there may be retaliation) this is my opinion. It's greed, manipulation and power. There is no heart or thought of anyone else's. No respect for the words my friend has written since she was a 14 year old in her bedroom. You've robbed and crushed one of our best song writers of our time an opportunity to celebrate all of her music with fans and the world [sic].\"\n\n\"Scott and Scooter, you know what the right thing to do is \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f,\" Gigi Hadid tweeted. \"Taylor and her fans deserve to celebrate the music!!\"\n\n\"Solidarity with Taylor here, this sounds awful,\" Lily Allen wrote on Twitter, \"and people wonder why music hasn't had its #MeToo moment?\"\n\n\"Fuck that. We're with you,\" tweeted Tinashe.\n\n\"[W]hat a complete power pull @scooterbraun @scottborchetta,\" tweeted Rebecca Black. \"The way this industry is set up, there are times where we have to get legal permission to perform anything we share rights to. but [sic] denying access like this is solely to play with and diminish a person.\"\n\n\"Not only are we looking at an awful business movie, (because one would be incentivized to allow Taylor to perform her songs seeing as it would direct to rediscovery of a catalog they currently profit off of) but this is just mean,\" Halsey wrote on Instagram. \"This is punishment. This is hoping to silence her from speaking about things by dangling this over her head.\n\n\"These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear,\" she continued, \"banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over reacting. You're barking up the wrong tree. It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her the Artist of the Decade.\"\n\nJustin Bieber chimed in on the drama.\n\nAs People reports, Bieber, a longtime friend and client of Braun, posted this cryptic message on his Instagram Story: \"I'm having a rough day, thought I'd share, remind you ur not alone. Keep pushing.\"\n\nSwift starts re-recording her albums.\n\nIn November 2020, Swift announced she was going to be recording her first six albums again so she could once more own the masters to her songs. She claimed that she initially tried to negotiate with Braun, but he had sold the masters to Shamrock Holdings and was still making money off of them.\n\nWith a new album and the massive Eras Tour taking Swift around the world through 2023 and 2024, it's no wonder she hasn't finished all her album re-records. But it's clearly still on her mind.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 17, while performing at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, Swift did a mashup of her songs \"I Forgot That You Existed\" and \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\"\n\nThe songs are considered some of Swift's \"diss\" tracks about her unnamed enemies, and the show coincided with Braun's 43rd birthday. The concert also happened to come a day after he announced his retirement from music management. Swift laughed loudly at the crowd's response to the tunes.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rose_minutaglio@elle.com", "name": "Rose

Both \"I Forgot That You Existed\" from Lover and \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things\" from Reputation are savage tracks that call out those who have wronged the pop star. So, you can imagine the weight they carried when Swift sang them together as surprise songs. Now, Swifties have also realized that she chose to mash these two tracks up on a significant day that alludes to the idea that she may have been dissing Scooter Braun through this performance.\n\nAs Swifties continue to speculate about Taylor Swift's upcoming projects, they're also paying close attention to the choices she makes on the Eras Tour. We know that she plants Easter eggs all over her work, so it's not farfetched to think that she's sending a message through this surprise song combo. Plus, she sang these two tracks that call out the people who have done her dirty in Cardiff on Scooter Braun's birthday.\n\nCoincidence? The fans think not, as @pieceofurheart posted:\n\nLots of fans caught on to this coincidence, and they think the performance could have been intentional. Swift and Barun have seemingly been in a feud for years. When Braun purchased Big Machine Records, the singer's former label, in 2019, he got the majority ownership of her master recordings. This has led to the \"The Man\" singer re-recording her first six albums, and she's made it pretty clear through her music and performances just how fed up she is with this deal.\n\nAs I mentioned, fans were quick to note how connected the song selection could be to Scooter Braun, as @take0utcoffees wrote:\n\nAlong with this happening on his birthday, there are some other coincidences surrounding this performance that also add more to the ongoing theory that Swift was dissing Braun through this mashup.\n\nFor one, in the fall of 2023, he reportedly parted ways with Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato and other longtime clients. Then a few days before the singer's performance in Cardiff, the music mogul announced on Instagram that he was retiring from music management.\n\nAlso, a documentary titled Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood will premiere on the 2024 TV schedule today (June 19) for those with a Max subscription.\n\nBasically, there are just a lot of things that line up and point to Swift possibly calling out Braun. While it's not confirmed in the slightest, there's no question that this is a lot of interesting coincidences. Plus, when you watch the performance (which you can see above), hearing all the lyrics together really re-emphasizes her feelings about being wronged, and one of the biggest wrongs that happened to her was because of the former music manager.\n\nWe'll likely never get official confirmation about this mashup and who it was about. However, these Swifties have made a compelling argument that it could have been a diss at Braun.

And after 23 years this chapter as a music manager has come to an end,\" Braun -- who has worked with Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Tori Kelly and more -- shared on his Instagram account earlier this week.\n\nGoing forward Braun, who's dad to three kids (with ex-wife Yael Cohen), will be a \"father first, a CEO second, and a manager no more,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scooter Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulation_(psychology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manipulation (psychology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybe_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybe Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultratop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultratop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Borchetta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Borchetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Machine Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forrest Gump (character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tori Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariana Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/ki8m9bOQ95obteEFM7RTeIvuiGY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-1-2000-5aa4e46373d6420f963ba86bfc494d93.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661118", "eventUri": "eng-9661118", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 19}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 872, "textEnd": 879}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

If you've spent any time on the internet in the years since, you're likely familiar with at least some of the drama between the singer and the infamous manager. What started as a dispute over Taylor's masters evolved into one of the biggest feuds to go down in Hollywood in recent history. But unless you're a diehard Swiftie, you might not realise just how deep this lore runs. So ahead of the release of Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood, we're taking a deep dive into the fraught history of this infamous duo. Below, everything you need to know about the feud between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun.\n\nFor a little back story, Scooter Braun is a talent manager who shot to fame for discovering a 12-year-old Justin Bieber in 2008. Since then, he has managed some of the biggest singers in the world, including Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato.\n\nIn 2018, Taylor left Big Machine Records -- the record label with whom she had recorded her first six albums -- and signed a new deal with Universal Music. However, because of stipulations in her contract (which she signed at just 15), when she left Big Machine Records, the company retained ownership of the masters of all the music she had recorded under them.\n\nFor those playing along at home, a master recording is the first recording of a song, from which all later copies are made. In other words, Big Machine Records owned all of Taylor's work to date.\n\nAt the time, however, Billboard reported that Universal Music Group was in talks to buy Big Machine Records, which, if successful, would mean Taylor would take ownership of her previous songs again.\n\nWhen the singer announced the move, she released a statement: \"I'm ecstatic to announce that my musical home will be Republic Records and Universal Music Group. It's also incredibly exciting to know that I'll own all of my master recordings that I make from now on.\"\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, in June 2019 Big Machine Records took to social media to announce that it had been acquired by talent manager Scooter Braun. As a result, Scooter and Big Machine Records' CEO, Scott Borchetta, took ownership over Taylor's masters.\n\nThe same day, Taylor took to Tumblr to share her frustration over the deal.\n\n\"For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and 'earn' one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums,\" she wrote.\n\n\"When I left my masters in Scott's hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell them. Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine the buyer would be Scooter. Any time Scott Borchetta has heard the words 'Scooter Braun' escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to. He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn't want to be associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever.\"\n\nAs for exactly why Taylor hates Scooter so much, she went on to explain:\n\n\"I learned about Scooter Braun's purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world. All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I've received at his hands for years. Like when Kim Kardashian orchestrated an illegally recorded snippet of a phone call to be leaked and then Scooter got his two clients together to bully me online about it. Or when his client, Kanye West, organised a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked. Now Scooter has stripped me of my life's work, that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.\"\n\nShe signed off the post by announcing her upcoming album - and the first of her music that she would officially own.\n\n\"Thankfully, I am now signed to a label that believes I should own anything I create. Thankfully, I left my past in Scott's hands and not my future. And hopefully, young artists or kids with musical dreams will read this and learn about how to better protect themselves in a negotiation. You deserve to own the art you make.\n\nI will always be proud of my past work. But for a healthier option, Lover will be out August 23.\"\n\nOf course, Big Machine Records wouldn't take Taylor's accusations lying down. In response to the viral Tumblr post, Scott Borchetta said:\n\n\"Taylor's dad, Scott Swift, was a shareholder in Big Machine Records, LLC. We first alerted all of the shareholders on Thursday, June 20, for an official shareholders' call scheduled for Tuesday, June 25. On the 6/25 call, the shareholders were made aware of the pending deal with Ithaca Holdings and had 3 days to go over all of the details of the proposed transaction. We then had a final call on Friday, June 28, in which the transaction passed with a majority vote and 3 of the 5 shareholders voting 'yes' with 92% of the shareholders' vote.\"\n\nBut Taylor's team were just as swift in their response, denying claims that Scott Swift had any involvement in the deal.\n\n\"Scott Swift is not on the board of directors and has never been. On June 25, there was a shareholder phone call that Scott Swift did not participate in due to a very strict NDA that bound all shareholders and prohibited any discussion at all without risk of severe penalty,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Her dad did not join that call because he did not want to be required to withhold any information from his own daughter. Taylor found out from the news articles when she woke up before seeing any text from Scott Borchetta and he did not call her in advance.\"\n\nIn her original Tumblr post, Taylor referenced an image posted to Instagram by Justin Bieber, which showed him on FaceTime with Kanye West and Scooter Braun, captioned, \"@TaylorSwift what up\"\n\nJustin responded by sharing an old image of he and Taylor, alongside a lengthy caption which appeared to be an apology, but quickly diverted into a defence of Scooter.\n\nSeveral other celebs commented on the post, including Hailey Bieber, who called her husband a \"gentleman,\" and Cara Delevingne, who called out his faux apology.\n\nKelly Clarkson took to Twitter to share what would actually turn out to be very fruitful advice for Taylor.\n\nLater, in an appearance on Good Morning America, Taylor confirmed that she intended to act on this wisdom, saying, \"It's something that I'm very excited about doing because my current contract says that starting November 2020 -- so next year -- I can record albums one through five all over again. I'm very excited about it because I think that artists deserve to own their work. I just feel very passionately about that.\"\n\nOn November 14, 2019, Taylor returned to Tumblr, to claim that Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta had barred her from performing her old music at that year's American Music Awards, where she was set to receive Artist Of The Decade.\n\n\"I've been planning to perform a medley of my hits throughout the decade on the show. Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun have now said that I'm not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be rerecording my music before I'm allowed to next year,\" she wrote.\n\nShe continued, \"The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished. This is WRONG. Neither of these men had a hand in the writing of those songs. They did nothing to create the relationship I have with my fans. So this is where I'm asking for your help.\"\n\nAgain, Big Machine Records denied Taylor's claims, saying the \"narrative\" she had created \"does not exist.\" They also argued that Taylor owed \"millions\" of dollars to the company, \"which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career.\"\n\nTaylor's PR, Tree Paine, was quick to clap back, not only sharing (now-deleted) receipts of Big Machine allegedly barring Taylor from performing her music, but also claiming that the label owed her $7.9 million.\n\nFast forward a few years (and plenty of shade-throwing in between), and Scooter Braun sold Taylor's masters for $300 million. The deal was done with an investment company which Taylor confirmed she was not affiliated with and, despite years of trying, she still did not own her masters.\n\nIn 2021, Taylor delivered the first of what we now know and love as 'Taylor's Version' of her original albums. First cabs off the rank were Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). In a clever marketing twist, Taylor also included previously unreleased tracks 'from the vault,' which encouraged fans to listen to the new albums as opposed to the original versions. And it's a tactic that paid off: Billboard reported that Fearless (Taylor's Version) sold 1 million equivalent album units in its first year of being released, versus 242,000 equivalent album units in the span of a year when it was originally released in 2008.\n\nAs of June, 2024, it seems the feud between Taylor and Scooter is alive and well. In fact, on June 19, when Scooter announced his retirement from the music industry, many Swifties think Taylor celebrated with a pointed 'diss track' mashup during her Eras concert in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nThe singer performed a medley of Lover's \"I Forgot That You Existed\" and Reputation's \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\" We know that, when it comes to Taylor, nothing is coincidental, so it seems likely that these tracks were pointed at Scooter's retirement.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The acquisition kicked off a lengthy public feud between Braun and Swift, and led the pop superstar to re-record her studio albums from Taylor Swift (2006) through Reputation (2017).\n\nNow, the feud is getting a deep-dive docuseries treatment in Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood. The two-part series, airing in the U.S. on Max, will give an episode to each side of the story. \"The $300M feud between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun made headlines,\" reads the series description. \"But is Taylor bravely standing up for artistry and fighting the misogyny of the music industry, or has Scooter Braun been unfairly framed for what was just a business deal?\"\n\nTaylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood is being released on Max in the U.S., and Discovery+ in the U.K. To watch the series in the States, sign up for Max or get a VPN to watch on Discovery+.\n\nMax offers three subscription tiers: With Ads, Ad-Free, and Ultimate Ad-Free.

Pop music folklore is marked by its infamous feuds. But perhaps none have been more seismic for the future of the industry than the rupture in the professional relationship between Taylor Swift and Scott \"Scooter\" Braun. The fallout is explored in a brand new docuseries from Max, and this guide explains how you can watch Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood from anywhere and for free.\n\nWith the epic Eras Tour currently still entertaining baying Swifties around the globe, this two-part documentary takes us back to 2019. A 29-year-old Taylor is six albums and 10 Grammy Awards into a career that is fast transcending mere superstardom. New album Lover is on the way and things are looking pretty rosey for TayTay.\n\nBut behind the scenes, there is some serious disquiet. Ithaca Holdings, the company owned by record executive extraordinaire Scooter Braun, buys Big Machine Records and, with it, the masters of all Taylor Swift records made to date - much to the artist's very obvious chagrin. What resulted was a very public beef and a power move made by Swift that may have just changed the music industry forever - rereleasing her first six albums dominating much of Taylor Swift's upcoming projects.\n\nTold in two parts, each episode sees the dispute through the eyes of one of its protagonists. Were Braun's actions unacceptable and a symptom of \"toxic male privilege\"? Or did Swift enlist her huge fanbase of Swifties to besmirch his reputation?\n\nA timely release considering Braun's recent announcement of his retirement from the music industry, whether or not you stand with Taylor, you can watch Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood online and for free on Max for a limited time.\n\nUS Swifties are in luck. Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood is being shown on HBO's premium streaming service Max. And, for a limited time, it's offering new subscribers a 7-day FREE trial, which means you can watch the two-part docuseries absolutely free - just so long as you register to the service before Sunday, June 23.\n\nBoth parts of Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood hit Max at the same time at 3am ET / 12am PT on Friday, June 21.\n\nIf you want to continue your Max subscription at the end of the free trial, plans start from $9.99 a month. But if you want to skip ads and download shows to watch on the go, you'll want to pick the $16.99 a month plan instead. Max also has its Ultimate tier, which allows 4K streams and Dolby Atmos sound for $20.99 a month.\n\nWhile services like Max block access from IP addresses outside of the US, there's a handy piece of software called a VPN that can change your IP address to make it look like you're accessing streaming services from any country in the world.\n\nFor example, US citizens overseas can subscribe to a VPN, join a US-based server and access their subscription from anywhere in the world, just like they would back home.\n\n1. Choose your ideal VPN and install - our go-to recommendation for unblocking is NordVPN, currently costing from just $3.99 a month with its 2-year plan\n\n2. Connect to a server - for Max, for example, you'll need to connect to a server located in the US\n\n3. Stream away! - login to your streaming service - Max in this instance - and stream like you were in your home country\n\nWith the Eras Tour currently on its UK leg, TaylorMania is at fever pitch around the British Isles. To watch Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood, you'll need access to Discovery Plus.\n\nThe streaming service costs from only \u00a33.99 per month and, as well as this docuseries, gives you access to content across channels such as Discovery, Animal Planet, Food Network, Quest TLC and more. Or you can pay more and add live sports providers like Eurosport and TNT Sports.\n\nTaylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood will land on Discovery Plus on Friday, June 21. Assuming that will be at the same time as it is on Max in the US, you should be able to watch from 8am BST.\n\nMost shows that land on Max usually end up on the Binge streaming service Down Under, but there's no sign that Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood will be shown there or anywhere else in the near future.\n\nSo if you're a US or UK resident currently in Australia and desperate to watch this docuseries, then we can only suggest that you download a VPN and watch it on your domestic streaming service as explained above.\n\nRight now, there's nothing to suggest that Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood will be shown in Canada. We had imagined that, like so many other HBO and Max shows, it would be streamed on Crave. But it isn't listed among its upcoming shows.

The 34-year-old pop sensation is currently on her Eras Tour and she combined two diss tracks: I Forgot That You Existed and This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things on the eve of her nemesis Scooter Braun's 43rd birthday on June 18, 2024.\n\nThe singer/songwriter sang the songs and when she reached the lyric, Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do, Swift threw both her hands in the air and let out a prolonged laugh with loyal fans cheering her on in the stadium. She seamlessly flowed from 2019's Lover album to her notoriously revengeful album Reputation, with both songs having some kind of shades, per PEOPLE.\n\nFans on X, formerly Twitter, flooded the social media confirming that the tracks were aimed at Braun who recently announced his retirement. For instance, this X user, @flame4goinghome, \"I FORGOT THAT YOU EXISTED X THIS IS WHY WE CANT HAVE NICE THINGS RIGHT AFTER SCOOTER BRAUN ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT, TAYLOR SWIFT WILL NEVER NOT BE FUNNY.\"\n\nAnother Swift fan account, @SwiftNYC, shared the video of the Bad Blood singer having a laugh, \"Taylor giggling and then saying 'with a straight face...' THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE! THINGS!\" @pieceofurheart echoed, \"I forgot that you existed x this is why we can't have nice things on Scooter Braun's birthday?\" @kazxnikolai appreciated Swift for her perfect timing, \"And on Scooter Braun's birthday of all days we do not give her enough credit for being the comedian she is.\"\n\nBraun and Swift had a fallout after the former's media company, Ithaca Holdings, acquired the rights of the singer's former label, Big Machine, for a reported $300 million. This gave the record executive rights to the majority of Swift's master recordings which led her to re-record all of her earlier works: Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation.\n\nThe Enchanted singer condemned the business deal on Tumblr, calling it her \"worst-case scenario\" and claiming that as a consequence she'd faced \"incessant, manipulative bullying\" for years, per US Weekly. During her appearance on Good Morning America, she announced that she'd be recording her first six albums again to gain the rights back, \"I think artists deserve to own their own work.\"\n\nIn April 2021, she wrote in the album's prologue letter, \"I've spoken a lot about why I'm remaking my first six albums but the way I've chosen to do this will hopefully help illuminate where I'm coming from. Artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really knows that body of work.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Braun announced his retirement as a music manager 5 years after his dispute with Swift. In a lengthy Instagram post, he shared the news with his followers, \"I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?' And after 23 years this chapter as a music manager has come to an end.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scooter Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SWIFT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulation_(psychology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manipulation (psychology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enchanted (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mastering (audio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forrest Gump (character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Machine Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/700413/uploads/462ca0a0-2e3c-11ef-9558-1135b2081239_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661118", "eventUri": "eng-9661118", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 331, "textEnd": 338}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The executive is known for having discovered Justin Bieber and has worked with stars such as Ariana Grande and Kanye West. It was a rather emotional feud, with Taylor taking to the Internet at the time to describe what what it had meant to her.\n\n\"For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work,\" she wrote in a Tumblr post back in 2019. \"Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and 'earn' one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.\"\n\n\"This is my worst case scenario,\" she wrote. \"This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term 'loyalty' is clearly just a contractual concept. And when that man says 'Music has value', he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it.\"\n\nShe also called out both Scooter and the founder of her former label Big Machine, Scott Borchetta. \"He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn't want to be associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever.\"\n\nAs a result, in 2021 Taylor started re-recording her albums, hence treating us to \"Taylor's Version\" of Fearless, Speak Now, Red and 1989 thus far. This move was a way to reclaim the creative rights over her back catalogue and career.\n\nHere's everything we know about the Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun: Bad Blood documentary.\n\nFeaturing commentary from legal experts, journalists and those close to both Swift and Braun, the documentary will be split into two one-hour segments, each tackling claims made from both sides.\n\nSwift has argued that her recordings were sold without her being consulted, with her being cut of the sale itself so she didn't have a chance to bid, and without the offer for her to buy them back. There have been arguments that her father knew about the purchase before she did, which have been refuted.\n\nScooter claims to have received death threats from Taylor Swift fans because of the issue and, according to a synopsis for the documentary, insists that Taylor \"refused to negotiate and instead incited a public feud by pitting her fan base against him\".", "source": {"uri": "glamourmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamourmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scooter Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_Stadium_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reputation Stadium Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mastering (audio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Borchetta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Borchetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Machine Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ariana Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6672c6fc323c70bc3ac645e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TAYLOR%20AND%20SCOOTER%20190624%20TAYLOR-AND-SCOOTER.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661118", "eventUri": "eng-9661118", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Scooter Braun purchased the rights to Swift's records for $300 million in 2019. This meant that Braun had total control of when, where, and how her old music could be used, and of course, he would be the sole receiver of all future royalties. The singer was not happy with the acquisition and voiced concerns about Braun's bullying behavior towards her, as well as not being given a fair chance to purchase her own songs.\n\nIn a social media post, she called him out, writing, \"For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and 'earn' one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past,\" adding, \"This is my worst case scenario. This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term 'loyalty' is clearly just a contractual concept. And when that man says 'Music has value', he means its value is beholden to men who had no part in creating it.\"\n\nIn retaliation, she started re-recording her albums so that she would have complete artistic and financial authority over the new versions (now called 'Taylor's Version').\n\nFive years on, Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood will examine the complexities of music licensing rights, gender dynamics in the music industry, and the strength of fan influence. Audiences will see legal experts, reporters, and those close to both parties present their cases for opposite sides of the beef. According to a press release, on the one hand, the show will focus on Swift and how the sale was executed without her involvement, and that she has since been barred from buying back her work. The other side will scrutinize Braun's claims that Swift declined to make a deal and started a public rivalry by instigating her fans against him.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a couple of ways to watch the Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun series in the US and UK that we have mentioned above in this article. However, if you're in an unsupported or blocked region, you need to use a VPN to change your virtual location.\n\nFinally, we propose NordVPN as the best tool to defeat geo-restrictions.

One episode will focus on Swift's side of the story, while the other will examine the situation from Braun's perspective. The central story is the sequence of events that led Swift to re-record her first six albums in order to maintain full control of those new masters, thus diminishing the value of her old masters that she claims were sold against her will.\n\nBraun, a controversial music industry impresario even separate from his entanglement with Swift, maintained that his business deal was simply a straightforward acquisition of Swift's old music label, which included her masters. His side contends that Swift had an opportunity to purchase her masters but chose to cast herself as a victim and turn the situation into a personal attack when it was a label acquisition -- that kind of business transaction that happens all the time.\n\nThe docuseries will premiere on Discovery+ in the UK and globally on Max on June 21 at 3:01 am ET and 12:01 am PT.\n\nWarner Bros.

As she approached the guitar set, fans were treated to yet another mashup -- fresh off the \"murder mashup\" in Liverpool -- this time combining \"I Forgot That You Existed\" and \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\"\n\nWhile she started with the first song, which hails from 2019's Lover -- the first album which she owned the masters for -- Swift seamlessly flowed into the second song from 2017's Reputation, her notorious revenge album. Both songs contain motifs of \"shady\" people who she no longer has time for as she moves on with her life.\n\nIt's not the biggest jump for fans to draw a line between the tunes and her relationship with Braun, which infamously soured after he purchased Swift's former label, Big Machine, for a reported $300 million. Via the purchase, Braun received majority ownership of Swift's master recordings and triggered a domino effect resulting in the re-recoding of all her earlier works, now known as \"Taylor's Version.\"\n\nFans who have stuck with Swift since the beginning easily connected Braun's June 18th birthday to the mashup of two of her most pointed diss tracks, calling the choice to blend the two songs anything but fortuitous.\n\nFurthermore, one video posted to X (formerly Twitter) shows the singer on stage and strumming along to \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,\" unable to fake sincerity as she delivers the line, \"And here's to you 'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do... Hahaha, I can't even say it with a straight face.\"\n\nOn social media, the singer's fans reacted to the \"hilarious\" mashup by not so subtly calling out Braun -- persona non grata among the Swifties -- and sarcastically wishing the music manager -- who announced his retirement earlier this week -- a happy birthday.\n\n\"i forgot that you existed x this is why we can't have nice things on scooter braun's birthday? #CardiffTSTheErasTour,\" one fan wrote in a tweet.\n\n\"its scooter braun's BIRTHDAY and she plays i forgot that you existed/this is why we can't have nice things HAHAHA,\" another Swiftie shared.\n\nA third lover of the \"Karma\" singer quoted one tweet announcing the surprise songs, adding, \"and on scooter braun's birthday of all days we do not give her enough credit for being the comedian she is.\"\n\nThe mashup comes a full five years after Swift first teased her interest in re-releasing her first six albums during an appearance CBS Sunday Morning in August 2019. Just days later, she followed that up on Good Morning America, where she confirmed she would be back in the studio to officially own her music.\n\n\"It's something that I'm very excited about doing because my contract says that starting November 2020, so next year, I can record albums one through five all over again. I'm very excited about it. I just think that artists deserve to own their own work. I just feel very passionately about that,\" she told host Robin Roberts.\n\nAt the time of the purchase, Swift claimed that her team attempted to enter into negotiations with Braun for her masters, but that Braun wanted her to sign an ironclad NDA stating that she would never say another word about him unless it was positive before they could even look at any financial records.\n\nBack in 2021, Braun -- who's famously worked with Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber -- disputed claims made by Swift and her team, telling Variety that while he regrets how the whole situation went down, there were some factual errors in how the story was perceived, according to him.\n\n\"I regret and it makes me sad that Taylor had that reaction to the deal. ... All of what happened has been very confusing and not based on anything factual,\" Braun told the outlet at the time. \"I don't know what story she was told. I asked for her to sit down with me several times, but she refused. I offered to sell her the catalog back and went under NDA, but her team refused.\"\n\nHe added, \"Open communication is important and can lead to understanding. She and I only met briefly three or four times in the past, and all our interactions were really friendly and kind. I find her to be an incredibly talented artist and wish her nothing but the best.\"\n\nUltimately, Braun sold off the catalog, netting a reported $160 million in the process, but the damage had already been done.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastering_(audio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mastering (audio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Machine Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennium Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motif (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domino effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_non_grata", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Persona non grata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(newscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin Roberts (newscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News_Sunday_Morning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News Sunday Morning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariana Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2019-11/eto_dn_taylor_swift_amas_111919.jpg?h=d1cb525d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661118", "eventUri": "eng-9661118", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1265, "textEnd": 1274}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-", "textStart": 2624, "textEnd": 2635}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 2871, "textEnd": 2884}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Many believe her surprise picks were subtly aimed at her former adversary, Scooter Braun.\n\nDuring her concerts, the 34-year-old pop star selects at least two surprise songs to add to her set list, with some shows featuring up to four or five unexpected tracks.This time, the timing and choice of songs caught the attention of many fans.\n\nSwift's feud with Braun began in 2019 when he acquired her previous record label, Big Machine Label Group, for over $300 million. This purchase included the rights to the master recordings of her first six albums, prompting Swift to start re-recording those albums under the \"Taylor's Version\" banner.\n\nOn Tuesday, which coincidentally was Braun's birthday and just one day after he announced his retirement from music management, Swift performed a mash-up of two songs that fans consider diss tracks: \"I Forgot That You Existed\" and \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\" The combination of these particular songs at such a significant moment led fans to believe they were chosen as a subtle jab at Braun.\n\nWhile Swift didn't explicitly mention Braun during her performance, the timing and selection of the songs left fans convinced that they were aimed at him. The ongoing saga between Swift and Braun has been a highly publicized aspect of her career, especially since it fueled her decision to reclaim her music by re-recording her earlier works.\n\nThe Eras Tour has been a platform for Swift not only to showcase her extensive music catalog but also to subtly address personal and professional issues through her song choices. Fans continue to dissect each set list for hidden meanings and potential messages, making each concert a subject of much discussion and speculation.\n\nAs Swift's tour progresses, fans eagerly await to see what other surprise songs she will perform and if there will be more moments that seem to reference her past conflicts. Whether or not these choices are deliberate, they certainly add an extra layer of intrigue to her already captivating performances.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

While both of the songs weren't necessarily written about Scooter, 43, fans pointed out the noticeable timing of when the pop star decided to perform them together.\n\n\"taylor said f-k you scooter i forgot that you existed but you're why we can't have nice things,\" one fan wrote on X, while another added, \"i forgot that you existed? As in the first song taylor swift ever owned? Right after the news that [scooter] is retiring broke? Oh taylor swift the woman that you are.\"\n\nMany Swifties also cracked up at the long laugh Taylor let out during the bridge of \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\" The lyrics feature her singing, \"Here's to my baby, he ain't hearing what they call me lately, and here's to my mama, who had to listen to all this drama, and here's to you, because forgiveness is a nice thing to do,\" before bursting into laughter. However, the laugh at the Cardiff show was noticeably drawn out compared to what's on the recorded version of the song.\n\nWhen Scooter purchased the rights to Taylor's masters from her original record label, Big Machine, in 2019, the \"Fortnight\" singer openly spoke about the years of issues she'd had with the executive. Scooter previously managed Kanye West and Justin Bieber, and Taylor accused him of \"bullying [her] on social media when [she] was at [her] lowest point.\" She was referencing when Justin, 30, posted a photo of himself on FaceTime with Ye, 47, and Scooter with the caption, \"Hey Taylor what's up,\" amid the Grammy winner's feud with Ye over his song \"Famous.\"\n\n\"When I left my masters in Scott [Borchetta]'s hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually, he would sell them,\" she wrote on Tumblr in 2019. \"Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine the buyer would be Scooter. Any time Scott Borchetta heard the words 'Scooter Braun' escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to. He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn't want to be associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever.\"\n\nTaylor has since been in the process of rerecording her first six albums, which are the ones she put out before switching record labels and earning the rights to her own work. So far, she has released four of the rerecorded albums, with just Reputation and Taylor Swift (debut) left to share.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooter confirmed on Monday, June 17, that he would be stepping away from his position as a manager to artists. \"It's a strange feeling because I think I have wanted this for a while, but I was truly afraid to answer the question 'who would I be without them?'\" he explained in an Instagram post. He also confirmed that he would be joining the board of the entertainment company Hybe and serving as CEO of Hybe America, while also focusing on his role as a father.", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@sunherald.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Borchetta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Borchetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scooter Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Machine Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybe_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybe Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Scooters", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Scooters", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/kg9adj/picture289387964/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5e9bcdaf-5cd4-4c19-b5c3-366d7cb080e0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661118", "eventUri": "eng-9661118", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 67, "textEnd": 74}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 2578, "textEnd": 2585}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

After graduating with honors from the University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'em, Horns!), Lauren wrote about film, television, awards season, music, and more for the likes of The Hollywood Reporter, Deadline Hollywood, Us Weekly, Awards Circuit, and others before landing at EW in May 2019.\n\nTaylor Swift was feeling her big Reputation during her Eras Tour show in Cardiff, Wales, on Tuesday, when she performed not one but two diss tracks from her oeuvre: \"I Forgot That You Existed\" and \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.\" Eagle-eyed fans were quick to point out that the mashup, which came during the surprise acoustic song set that differs every night of the tour, came just one day after Scooter Braun announced his retirement as a music manager. Tuesday also happened to be Braun's birthday.\n\nSwift did not mention Braun or their yearslong dispute over the rights to the master recordings of her first six albums, which Braun's Ithaca Holdings acquired in 2019 (and later sold to private equity company Shamrock Holdings both to Swift's dismay, ultimately resulting in her re-recording said albums to own them herself).\n\nShe did, however, bust out laughing on stage during the mashup, which she performed on acoustic guitar. In videos shared by attendees, Swift can be seen getting to the part in Reputation track \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things\" where she sings \"Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,\" but instead of a short cackle like in the original recording, she just could not stop laughing, much to the screaming crowd's delight. Eventually, she continued with the lyrics, \"I can't even say it with a straight face,\" before finishing the performance.\n\nThis was not the first time the 14-time Grammy winner had performed these particular songs during the Eras Tour, though. She previously performed both during other acoustic sets earlier in the tour, although it was the first time they'd been combined together. The set, which always features one performance on guitar and one on piano, is a fan-favorite, as Swift aims to perform a different song (or mashup) for each at every tour date.\n\nBraun announced with a lengthy statement on Monday that he was stepping back from music management after 23 years, sharing that he instead will focus on his position as CEO of HYBE America and on his family. He unofficially stepped back from managing top artists such as Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato, and Ariana Grande last year.\n\n\"It's a strange feeling because I think I have wanted this for a while, but I was truly afraid to answer the question 'who would I be without them?'\" Braun mused in his statement Monday. \"I was really just 19 years old when I started. So for my entire adult life I played the role of an artist manager on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And for 20 years I loved it. It's all I had known.\"\n\n\"But as my children got older, and my personal Iife took some hits, I came to the realization that my kids were 3 superstars I wasn't willing to lose,\" he added. \"The sacrifices I was once willing to make I could no longer justify. It was time to step into a new role.\"\n\nSwift's Eras Tour continues this weekend with three shows in London.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"},

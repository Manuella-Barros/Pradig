Price has officially filed with the Department of Elections; Ramone announced to the press he would file on May 6.\n\nThe victor of the Republican primary will face off against whoever wins the Democratic primary on Sept. 10. There are three candidates vying for the Democratic nomination: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer, Lt. Govenor Bethany Hall-Long and former DNREC Secretary Collin O'Mara.\n\nIf either Ramone or Price are elected, they would become Delaware's first republican governor in roughly three decades. The last was Gov. Dale Wolf who served for three weeks after then-Gov. Mike Castle resigned to ascend to Delaware's lone congressional seat in 1993.\n\n\"Truly, I'm not running to be the first Republican governor in 30 years, I'm running to be the first governor elected by the people,\" Ramone told the Delaware Business Times. \"With how the political dynamics are today, I thought we can do business a little differently: with compassion and without toxicity. As a leader in the house, I've been able to build relationships and it's by focusing on our similarities, not our differences.\"\n\nRamone kicked off his gubernatorial campaign by holding a press tour of all three counties, ending with Wilmington this afternoon. The Delaware GOP has also shown signs that it will back Ramone's bid. Julianne Murrary, the state GOP chairwoman, had declared she would file for the race but, as of Monday afternoon, she decided to back down and work to rally the party behind a single candidate.\n\nRamone, a husband, father and grandfather, is a Newark native that held his seat for the 21st District for 16 years. A serial entrepreneur, Ramone opened his first business, Ramone's Flower Shoppes, when he was 21 years old.\n\nOver the years, he and his wife Lisa opened a funeral home and landscaping business, pool maintenance company Aquatic Management Systems, property management firm BC Communities and swim center D-Fit. His businesses employ 200 people throughout the year.\n\nRamone was driven to run for office as far back as 1998 when he ran for the 22nd House District seat, later running twice for the state senate. When then-Rep. Pam Maier decided to step down, she threw her support behind him in a highly-watched race.\n\nIn 2008, the 21st district was a battleground state with a slim voter margin between the two parties. At the time, The News Journal reported that the district had a 788 registered voter advantage over Republicans.\n\nStill, Ramone won that race by 1,000 votes. Over the years, he's faced stiff competition at the polls. In the 2022 election, Ramone narrowly defeated scientist and business owner Frank Burns by 35 votes.\n\nRamone told DBT that he won those races by appealing to the third party - the independents. By his research, there were around 250 more independent voters than registered Republicans in the district.\n\n\"I try to be helpful and, the truth is, over the years through my businesses, I've met and connected with a lot of people,\" Ramone said. \"It's not that I didn't knock on someone's door if they were a Democrat. You just do your job and try to help people.\"\n\nRegardless of the gubernatorial race, Ramone said that he and his wife were also preparing to move to Dewey Beach, so he would eventually have to step down from his office sooner or later.\n\nRamone told DBT that his priorities would be to improve Delaware's education through offering more autonomy in the districts among other measures; addressing the opioid crisis; and focusing on business.", "source": {"uri": "delawarebusinesstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Delaware Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_tabeling@delawarebusinesstimes.com", "name": "Katie Tabeling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_E._Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dale E.

Murray lost to Gov. Carney in 2020.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the 2024 elections? What major issues do you want candidates to address? Let us know.\n\nFor months, the race to succeed Delaware Gov. John Carney has focused on three fellow Democrats seeking the office in a state their party dominates.\n\nBut with the Sept. 10 primary just four months away, Republicans now have a two-person race for the GOP nomination. That scenario surfaced this week when House Minority Leader Mike Ramone joined political newcomer Jerry Price, a former New York City cop, on the ballot. Price filed for the office in December.\n\nWhen Ramone filed Monday, state GOP chair Julianne Murray, who had said she was also entering the race this week, announced that she would forgo a run in the interests of \"party unity.\" The party will endorse a candidate later this month during its annual convention.\n\nMurray, a lawyer, had run against Carney in 2020, winning 39% of the vote -- about the same as other GOP statewide candidates that year. She also ran unsuccessfully for attorney general against incumbent Kathy Jennings in 2022.\n\nDemocrats hold all nine statewide elective offices and have a nearly two-to-one advantage in voter registration. The last Republican governor was Mike Castle, who held the post from 1985 to 1993.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the candidates are Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer, and former state environmental chief Collin O'Mara.\n\nPrimary winners will face off in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nRamone, who owns a swim club, fitness center, landscaping, pool and property management business, has represented the Pike Creek area since 2008. He became the minority leader in 2023.\n\nRamone announced last week that he's not seeking re-election to the House for two reasons: he is moving to Dewey Beach, where he has long had a second home, and he was seeking the GOP gubernatorial nod.\n\nRamone, 62, told WHYY News that his business experience, 16 years in the General Assembly, and a lifetime spent in Delaware qualify him to head the state government.\n\nHe said the governor's office needs new direction after 32 years in Democratic hands, especially since the state House and Senate are dominated by the majority party.\n\n\"I think Delaware needs a breath of fresh air -- somebody who's not as politically motivated, but somebody who would represent Delawareans, not one party or the other.\"\n\nAs a state representative for 16 years, \"I've learned an awful lot about the way people do things, what they do, why they do it,'' he said. \"And you know, I'm just concerned. I'm concerned our schools are deteriorating. I'm concerned health care [costs have] gone up and up and up and up.\"\n\nRamone also cited the state's high rate of traffic fatalities, including three in recent days, as well as the opioid crisis.\n\n\"There's just so much that it's concerning and it's painful. I think we need to start prioritizing what we need to do for the people, start using a little bit of common sense, and get out of this polarizing political environment we have.\"\n\nAsked about the Democrats' 145,000 registration advantage over Republicans in a state with 775,000 voters, Ramone asserted that should he win the nomination, he trusts voters of all political persuasions to give him a fair hearing.\n\n\"I don't think it's about blue and red. I think it's about doing things better and solving problems,'' Ramone said. \"We're all buying the same groceries, We're all paying the same inflation. We are all having our same taxes go up. We're all under the same social unrest and concern for safety.\"\n\n\"We're all in the exact same environment, with trying to get children coming out of our schools with the ability to function in society. We all have the same problems. It doesn't matter if you're red or blue. We're all trying to make Delaware a better place to live.\"\n\nRamone said he'd also like to make it easier for small businesses to be successful by easing the \"overzealous quantity of regulations\" that currently exist.\n\nHe said that as an entrepreneur who started a family flower business when he was 21, \"I have the experience of knowing how to run a significantly large payroll, what it's like to have to sign the front of the checks.\"", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We must break the stranglehold of one-party rule.\"\n\nPENSION PLANS: Delaware made changes to its lawmaker pension plan 27 years ago. Why they didn't stick\n\nWith Murray out of the gubernatorial race, this now leaves Ramone to face Price in a Republican Primary in September.\n\nThe winner in the primary would then face one of the three Democratic candidates for governor: Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer or former state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Collin O'Mara.", "source": {"uri": "delawareonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethany_Hall-Long", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethany Hall-Long"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Collin County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Castle_County,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Castle County, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Castle County, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/11/09/PWIL/0cce57c6-e0df-4447-b473-c6eda9e16dad-110822-342.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2099,1181,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543925", "eventUri": "eng-9543925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

MM suffers a major panic attack, A-Train puts himself closer to danger, and we discover Joe Kessler is literally a figment of Butcher's imagination. But the most uncomfortable part of this episode of The Boys (besides Homelander sucking milk from Firecracker's breasts) is Tek Knight and his Tek Cave.\n\nRelated: Who Is Tek Knight? His Comic and TV History in The Boys Universe, Explained\n\nA-Train reveals to MM that Cameron Coleman was brutally killed after Ashley set him up as the Vought leak. He also tells MM about Homelander bringing the Seven, Cate, and Sam together to form a supe army for some reason and Tek Knight was talking to Sage in secret. So, Hughie, MM, Starlight, and Kimiko go on their own undercover mission at Tek Knight's federalist society party (I know...) at his estate to find more information. (Frenchie turned himself in for his crimes, so he is locked up. And Butcher is off torturing Sameer like a psychopath, unbeknownst to everyone else.)\n\nMM is able to accost Webweaver, a very gross supe who is an obvious parody of Spider-Man, and get Hughie into his smelly suit to infiltrate the party. It is a risky move considering Tek Knight has superhuman smell/taste and he can sense when a person's heart rate increases or if they are nervous. Things are initially going well despite Hughie discovering that Sage, Homelander, Firecracker, and Victoria Neuman are also at this party.\n\nThen, it goes quickly awry when Tek Knight invites Hughie, whom he initially seems to believe is the real Webweaver, to his Tek Cave (a play on Batman's Bat Cave). The Tek Cave is deep under his estate, minded by his butler/right-hand man Elijah (read: Alfred). It is basically a BDSM and/or torture chamber for Tek Knight to appease his sexual proclivities. That guy loves all sorts of holes. Hughie goes along with Tek Knight's weird request to sit his naked butt on a cake and pass gas into it.\n\nBut everything goes way left field with the arrival of Ashely, who apparently matches (and perhaps exceeds) Tek's freak. Oh, and Tek Knight's former sidekick Laddio is in a full leather outfit and chained to the wall to watch it all.\n\nAshley binds Hughie up, tickles his feet, and says some pretty explicit things about what she will do to him. We don't see any of them happen thankfully but she does, um, climax and wipe her fingers on the mask Hughie is wearing. Tek Knight is watching it all and asks Hughie what the safeword is, which Hughie doesn't know because he is not a regular member of the Tek Cave Sex Club. Meanwhile, the Boys crew decides to stage a rescue mission (To the Tek Cave!) which predictably goes wrong. After a few setbacks, Starlight and Kimiko reach the Tek Cave and subdue Tek Knight, who is preparing to torture and assault Hughie.\n\nThey try to torture information out of Tek Knight, which doesn't work because he's a masochist. So they hit him where it really hurts: his pockets. They send millions to liberal organizations but he doesn't crack until they almost make a donation to Black Lives Matter. He tells them that Sage and Homelander want to use the many prisons he owns to create internment camps for regular humans. This is highly disturbing for a couple of reasons. First, as we heard earlier in the episode, this is why Tek Knight is so filthy rich. Second, this is a scary development in Homelander and Sage's plan to control the masses while supes rule with impunity.\n\nTek Knight admits he doesn't know the details of their plans. And, to be honest, it would not be smart for him to say no considering Homelander could kill him. He might as well have said no because Elijah steps in and suddenly kills Tek Knight. Elijah says he's been tired of Tek Knight's entitlement and gross behavior but creating internment camps takes things too far. The crew escapes while Elijah and Laddio stay behind to make Tek Knight's death look like an accident. Hughie is very disturbed by what he endured and has a breakdown, saying he misses his father. That poor guy is having an awful time.\n\nLater on, Firecracker tells Homelander Tek Knight is dead and that she saw Starlight at the house. Now, he knows the leak wasn't Cameron, but someone else. Between this and a kid spotting A-Train saving MM's life, it is not looking good for the speedster. Tek Knight's death is a lot less weird than it was in The Boys' comics but that Tek Cave makes this version of the character one to remember.\n\nWe will have to see how his demise throws a wrench in Homelander and Sage's plan and if Laddio and Elijah will step up to help the Boys in the near future. The Boys do have access to Tek Knight's information via that laptop for now, so there could be other secrets that will help them end this plan for good.", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man (2018 video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panic attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elijah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeword", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safeword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flatulence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhuman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BDSM"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidekick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidekick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heart rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Caving", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Caving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/02090210/Tek-Knight-The-Boys-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Yep, apparently this was Hugh Sr.'s wish, to have his ashes spread throughout the city at the filming locations of his favorite movie. Hughie's mother (Rosemarie DeWitt) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) are both there, along with the rest of the Boys. Well, most of them, anyway.\n\nFrenchie (Tomer Capone) is notably absent, and that's 'cause last episode, overcome with guilt, he turned himself in to the police, confessing to the murders he committed in his past life as a Russian mafia hitman. But even worse than the murders, according to Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), is the fact that Frenchie surrendered without talking to her first. So after Hugh Sr.'s \"funeral\", she goes to visit him in prison... but he won't see her.\n\nMeanwhile, Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) receives a call from a panicked A-Train (Jessie T. Usher), who's worried about being fingered as a traitor, after leaking intel to the Boys. MM's able to talk A-Train off a ledge and get a key piece of information from him - supe Tek Knight (Derek Wilson) is hosting a \"Federalist Society\" get-together at his estate, where it seems like some truly evil stuff is gonna be going down.\n\nSo MM gathers the Boys and tasks them with infiltrating this alt-right party to find out what they're up to. But his plan to get someone inside is as risky as it is hilarious.\n\nA supe named Web Weaver, they learn, has been invited to audition for the role of Tek Knight's new sidekick. So MM visits Web Weaver... and sticks a roofie up his butt (not by choice, it's just WW's preferred injection site, to our and MM's disgust). Once WW's out cold, they take his suit... and put Hughie in it, so he can pose as WW, attend the party, and bug the place.\n\nAnnie's hesitant about sending Hughie on a dangerous mission so soon after his father's death, but Hughie insists that focusing on work is exactly the distraction he needs. So Hughie dons the suit (smelly as it is), and waltzes into the lion's den.\n\nAll the power players are gathered there: Homelander (Antony Starr), Sage (Susan Heyward), Neuman (Claudia Doumit), Firecracker (Valorie Curry), the U.S. Speaker of the House, and a litany of billionaires. As Hughie plants listening devices throughout the house, he's approached by Tek Knight, who invites him down into \"the Tek Cave\" for his sidekick audition. To avoid arousing suspicions, Hughie is forced to oblige.\n\nSo he follows Tek into his \"cave,\" which turns out to be a creepy sex dungeon. To maintain his cover as Web Weaver, Hughie has to perform some truly bizarre acts (for the sake of your browser history, do not google \"Cake Farts\") before things quickly escalate and he finds himself tied to a table while Ashley (Colby Minifie) mercilessly tickles his feet and pleasures herself. If this isn't the most bizarre sentence I've ever written....\n\nIf only that's as bad as it got in the Tek Cave. But this is The Boys, so that was just an amuse bouche. Now, Tek wants to carve a new hole into Hughie so he can... use it for his pleasure... and the only way for Hughie to get out of it is to utter Web Weaver's safe word. But when it becomes clear that Hughie doesn't know it, Tek rips Hughie's mask off and blows his cover. So as Hughie squirms and Tek prepares to get into some true sadism...\n\nThe Boys sneak into the estate to save Hughie, having lost communication with him when he descended into... well, pretty much hell. MM and Kimiko find Sister Sage in Tek's study, where the entrance to the Tek Cave is hidden. MM urges Sage to step off, but she dashes to hit the alarm, and in a fit of anxiety, MM shoots her in the head before fainting from a panic attack. Kimiko convinces A-Train to dash MM to the hospital.\n\nKimiko and Starlight find their way into the Tek Cave just in time so save Hughie, then tie Tek to his own torture rack and press him for information on what he and Sage are up to.\n\nThey beat and stab Tek, trying to force him to squeal... but all the pain does is get him super horny. Hughie asks: \"How do you torture a masochist?\" and soon they come up with a brilliant solution - you torture him by doing good.\n\nSo with the help of a Pulp Fiction-style sex gimp Tek's been keeping in the dungeon (you can't make this stuff up... unless you write on The Boys, I guess), they hack into Tek's bank accounts and start donating money to charitable causes. Tek's furious, doing his best to hold out, but when they threaten to donate $100 million to Black Lives Matter, he breaks. \"Not those people!\"\n\nEarlier in the night, Tek was bragging about how his family made their billions - centuries ago, they were slave catchers, and now they do... sort of the 21st century version of that: they own the largest network of private prisons in the world. And that's what Sage wanted with Tek: she and Tek struck a deal to allow Vought to use his prisons as internment camps for dissidents.\n\nThere's plenty of drama playing out upstairs as well. Homelander and Sage's plan here is to gather up all the most powerful people in the world so Sage can talk them into invoking the 25th amendment, ousting Singer and making Neuman president.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nOnly problem - Sage got shot in the head by MM, and while she heals from it, the temporary brain damage leaves her, well... not quite as intelligent as she usually is, to put it lightly. Homelander is left on his own to convince \"35 percent of the U.S.'s GDP\" to play along with their 25th amendment plan. But his bluster only takes him so far, and he quickly finds himself out of his element when these power players ask about his plans to keep the markets and the Justice Department calm amidst this proposed presidential coup.\n\nWith Homelander floundering, Neuman steps up, essentially promising these elites a blank check to do whatever the hell they want once she becomes president. Neuman's speech successfully persuades the .01 percenters, but Homelander's left feeling useless and pathetic.\n\nLater, back at Vought, we find Homelander in a sorry, self-pitying state... when he's visited by Firecracker. Initially, he wants nothing to do with her after she got embarrassed by Starlight on VNN, but then... she takes her shirt off, and squirts breast milk in his face.\n\nAnd if you remember season 1, you'll know that breast milk is Homelander's kryptonite. Firecracker knows this too, and, obsessed with attaching herself to Homelander, has been taking medications to help her lactate. So as her juices drip down the supe god's face, Homelander instantly melts, and we leave him curled up on Firecracker's lap, suckling like the little man-child he is.\n\nNow, at this point you might be wondering where Butcher (Karl Urban) has been all episode. Fear not, he's been a bit busy... leading us through perhaps the most mind-bending storyline of the whole season.\n\nLast week, Butcher kidnapped Vought scientist Sameer (Omid Abtahi) and brought him to Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) with the intent of forcing him to make a dose of the supe-killing virus strong enough to eliminate Homelander. But now we learn Sameer's refusing to do it.\n\nEventually, Butcher learns why. Sameer tells them that through Vought's research, they discovered that in order to make the virus lethal enough to end a supe, it'd also become airborne and highly contagious, infecting and killing every supe on the planet.\n\nKessler, of course, loves this idea. But Butcher's conscience comes burning through in the form of a hallucination of his departed wife Becca (Shantel VanSanten). As Becca urges Butcher to find his humanity and let Sameer go, Kessler pushes him to grow a pair and do what's necessary to keep the world safe from supes. The angel and devil on Butcher's shoulders pull him back and forth, when suddenly... Kessler snaps at Becca, trying to shut her up.\n\nBut wait... how can Kessler see Becca if she's a hallucination? Because he's one too. That's right, we've now gone full Fight Club. Kessler was always a figment of Butcher's imagination, as flashbacks to the rest of the season help clarify for us.\n\nKessler is Butcher's dark side, Becca is his light, and the fate of the world now rests on the twisted, conflicted conscience of Billy Butcher.

Tek Knight first appeared in The Boys franchise via its spin-off show Gen V after getting brief mentions in the previous three seasons. He more recently appeared in the fifth and sixth episodes of The Boys Season 4.\n\nSo does Tek Knight die or is he alive after The Boys Season 4 Episode 6? Who killed him? Here are your answers.\n\nDid Tek Knight die or is he alive after The Boys Season 4 Episode 6?\n\nTek Knight seemingly dies after The Boys Season 4 Episode 6.\n\nIn The Boys Season 4 Episode 6, Tek Knight hosts a house party attended by Supes and important people. Hughie disguises himself as Webweaver and arrives at the house on an undercover mission to gather information on Homelander and Sister Sage's plans.\n\nHowever, Tek Knight catches Hughie disguised as Webweaver and starts sexually assaulting him alongside Ashley Barrett. Knight soon unmasks Hughie and attempts to kill him to gain Homelander's approval. Unfortunately for Knight, Starlight and Kimiko appear and save Hughie. Starlight and Kimiko then start torturing Knight to gain information on Homelander and Sage's plans.\n\nAt Laddio's suggestion, they start emotionally torturing Knight by hitting him where it hurts and sending most of his money to charities. Knight finally gives in and reveals Homelander's plans. Later, Tek Knight's butler Elijah, starts strangling him, telling Hughie, Starlight, and Kimiko to leave, claiming they will make Knight's death look like an accident.\n\nWho killed Tek Knight in The Boys Season 4?\n\nTek Knight is seemingly killed by his butler Elijah and his former protege Laddio. However, whether Tek Knight died for certain remains unclear. This is because he was neither seen dying nor was his dead body shown.

Spoilers for The Boys season 4, episode 6 below.\n\nSummary The Boys season 4, episode 6 highlights flaws as it heads towards a conclusion, with Butcher weighing the choice of using the Supe virus and risking genocide. Joe Kessler is revealed to be a hallucination, and Butcher may be getting ready to make major sacrifices in the last two episodes of season 4. The episode's political commentary feels like a copy-paste of real-world situations, leaving The Boys spinning its wheels towards an endgame.\n\nDespite a few major revelations, The Boys season 4's episode 6 is the series at its most reductive, highlighting some of its flaws as it heads towards a conclusion. We get another classic sting operation for the titular team as Tek Knight holds a gathering of rich right-wingers who will be pitched on Homelander and Sister Sage's plan to take over the United States.\n\nThe Boys ActionDramaCrime Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nCast Elisabeth Shue , Jensen Ackles , Goran Visnjic , Jessie T. Usher , Chace Crawford , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Nathan Mitchell , Aya Cash , Colby Minifie , Karl Urban , Erin Moriarty , Karen Fukuhara , Jack Quaid , Antony Starr , claudia doumit , Tomer Capon Release Date July 26, 2019 Seasons 4 Streaming Service(s) Amazon Prime Video Showrunner Eric Kripke Expand\n\nElsewhere, Butcher is still at Victoria Neuman's farm upstate, torturing her lab tech Sameer to coerce him into making more of the Supe virus. He only needs one dose, enough to take out Homelander, but Sameer warns that the dose could turn into an airborne virus that kills all Supes, effectively making Butcher complicit in genocide. He's forced to weigh the choice and this culminates in a surprising reveal.\n\nButcher Is Doing A Lot Worse Than We Thought On top of the V-related sickness, he's also hallucinating Close\n\nButcher's world gets blown wide open in episode 6 when Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character, Joe Kessler, is revealed to be a hallucination when he directly addresses Becca Butcher, who has been appearing to Butcher in key moments. It's a reveal that's been telegraphed from the beginning -- in the image above, the perspective of Butcher from the point of view of the coffee cup hints at something deeper happening in the scene -- but that only dims the surprise a bit.\n\nButcher may be getting ready to make some major sacrifices in the last two episodes of season 4.\n\nIt's now very clear that a part of Butcher is willing to wipe out every Supe in existence if that means taking out Homelander and this only confirms that the former leader of the Boys may be too far gone. His quest to save Ryan and take out Homelander has fundamentally altered him and, like the V inside his body, is working like a poison as it moves through his system. Butcher may be getting ready to make some major sacrifices in the last two episodes of season 4.\n\nSo What The Hell Is Going On At Tek Knight's Mansion? The Boys' latest mission puts many of them in compromising positions Close\n\nThe festivities at Tek Knight's mansion are an easy set-up for a new mission. The objective: To bug the rooms so that they can hear what is being said between Homelander, Sister Sage, and various high-ranking politicians and billionaire types. Hughie is meant to plant the bugs in disguise as Web Weaver, a drugged-up Supe who is incapacitated by Mother's Milk in a particularly disgusting scene.\n\nUnfortunately, Hughie is only able to plant a few bugs before he's lured to Tek Knight's sex dungeon and tied up for some psychosexual torture. Turns out, Tek Knight's desire for a sidekick is only so he can take out his sadomasochistic fantasies on someone in a superhero suit and, when Ashley joins, we're treated to an extended sequence of Hughie's torture.\n\nIf it weren't discomforting, it would just be boring.\n\nThe scene is played for laughs, but it's not all that funny, nor is it as boundary-pushing or shocking as The Boys seems to think it is. That Hughie is essentially being sexually assaulted is of no concern in the scene and while that topic is not outside the show's wheelhouse, it does feel especially strange in this instance. Peppered in with some vicious racism from Tek Knight (more \"satire\" I'm sure), and the whole dungeon scene leaves a bad taste. If it weren't discomforting, it would just be boring.\n\nElsewhere, it is revealed that Homelander's plan actually involves Tek Knight because of the latter's empire of private prisons in the United States. Homelander and Sage plan to imprison political dissenters and Tek Knight is more than willing to help. As the only other revelation in the episode, it's a startling one, and it illuminates more of Homelander's plan that will presumably come to a head on January 6th, the date the finale is leading up to.\n\nRelated The Boys Season 4's Pattinson Batman Parody Hides A Seriously Disgusting Joke\n\nThe Boys is a clear parody of superheroes and comics, but Tek Knight's Batman parody is one of the most subtly disturbing bits in the whole show.\n\nElsewhere in Tek Knight's mansion, Annie confronts Firecracker, MM has a panic attack, and Kimiko and Annie are able to save Hughie with the help of Tek Knight's chained up sex slave. A-Train's redemption continues when he runs MM to the hospital while Neuman formally sides with Homelander in front of the billionaire gatherers. In one last scene, Firecracker attempts to push Sage out of the way by revealing that she can now produce breast milk, much to Homelander's chagrin.\n\nWhile The Boys season 4 has proven entertaining at times, much of it has felt like the series is spinning its wheels while it crawls towards an endgame. The show ending with season 5 looks more like a good idea every day, as this latest episode proves my fears -- there's not much more shock value to be pulled from this series and there certainly isn't any more incisive satire being aimed at the audience.\n\nMuch of the season's political commentary (and this episode, in particular) is a copy-paste of real world situations -- billionaires meeting in wood-paneled backrooms, a joke about one of those men who refuse to be alone with a woman who isn't his wife, Tek Knight's explanation of the prison industrial complex and his gleeful complicity, Firecracker's Q-Anon-esque podcast and her brain-dead supporters. There's no joke or commentary here, and it's certainly not shocking -- we've seen it all before.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Episode\n\nRelease Date\n\nEp. 6: \"Dirty Business\"\n\nJuly 4\n\nEp. 7: \"The Insider\"\n\nJuly 11\n\nEp. 8: Assassination Run\n\nJuly 18\n\nI have faith that The Boys has some juice left in it. Butcher and Homelander's inevitable showdown, the former's reunion with Ryan (in whatever form that may be), the various fates of all the characters we've come to know over the past four seasons -- these are all things that I can't wait to see.\n\nBut as it stands right now, the show feels like it's playing its cards too close to the chest when it comes to plot while flinging around on-the-nose commentary that's as sharp as an overused knife. This latest episode solidifies those fears and The Boys will have to take significant leaps to escape this rut before the end of season 4.\n\nThe Boys season 4, episode 6 is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name. Set in a \"what-if\" world that reveres superheroes as celebrities and gods who experience minimal repercussions for their actions. However, one group of vigilantes headed by a vengeance-obsessed man named Billy Butcher will fight back against these super-charged \"heroes\" to expose them for what they are.\n\nPros Cons", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "craig_elvy@screenrant.com", "name": "Craig Elvy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "justin_epps@screenrant.com", "name": "Justin Epps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kyle_mcleod@screenrant.com", "name": "Kyle McLeod", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "amanda_mullen@screenrant.com", "name": "Amanda Mullen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brandon_zachary@screenrant.com", "name": "Brandon Zachary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

The members of the Seven aren't hiding their inspirations. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and The Flash have perfect comedy copycats. Some of the satirical takes are a bit less obvious. The Boys has a parody of Iron Man, one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's flagship characters. With such interesting source material, why did the series keep Tek Knight in the background?\n\nThe Boys might be the strongest argument for creators taking liberties with adaptations. The original comic is an unmitigated disaster that puts every aspect of decent storytelling to one side in favor of grotesque, insufferable, edgelord garbage. It's a troubled eleven-year-old's idea of maturity, in which gross sex stuff, gratuitous violence, and meaningless brutality are the only available languages. The Boys gets a lot of flack for falling back on pointless gore and nudity, but it manages to pack in strong social commentary, excellent characters, and stirring emotional moments. It's a tremendous improvement that should silence anyone claiming that adaptations should stay faithful.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys: Sister Sage, Explained\n\nWho is Sister Sage in The Boys and why is she helping Homelander?\n\nWho is Tek Knight in The Boys comics?\n\nRobert Vernon is the third person to carry the name Tek Knight. He's a supe who works for Vought, but he is a rare example of a supe without superpowers. Each Tek Knight wears a suit of technologically advanced super armor that grants a variety of superhuman abilities. He's a broad parody of Marvel's Iron Man, with a dash of Batman for fun. Tek Knight can fly, launch EMP blasts, wield flamethrowers, and emit an electrical charge from his armor. He has a young sidekick called Laddio, who is also regularly replaced. Robert's Laddio is the fourth young man to wear the costume. Tek Knight was initially the leader of the Maverikz, a minor team of young superheroes who lost relevance after Tek left. A new leader replaced Tek, and Billy Butcher and his Boys delivered the team a savage beating after Tek's replacement murdered a sex worker. They all presumably died after Homelander's failed coup. Tek joined Payback, but his career there wasn't especially long.\n\nRobert is a comparatively decent supe. He doesn't kill a ton of people or abuse his powers in nightmarish ways. Soldier Boy goes out of his way to describe him as one of the few people ever to be nice to him. Robert is homophobic, but that's a consistent element of the comic series. The Boys only cross paths with Robert because he comes up as a suspect in the murder of a young gay man. He was innocent, and the Boys later found his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Swingwing, guilty of the crime. Robert is, however, suffering from a massive tumor in his brain. Because this is The Boys comic, this terminal growth causes Robert to develop intense paraphillia. He engages in inexplicable and uncontrollable sexual actions with objects and people, seemingly with little input of his own. His bizarre actions leak to the press through his butler, ending his superhero career. Shortly thereafter, Robert dies trying to save a woman and her child from a wheelbarrow full of falling bricks. His presence is limited, embarrassing, and grim.\n\nWho is Tek Knight in The Boys show?\n\nActor\n\nDerek Wilson\n\nFirst Mentioned\n\nThe Boys Season 1, Episode 6: \"The Innocents\"\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nGen V Season 1, Episode 4: \"The Whole Truth\"\n\nRobert Vernon plays a slightly different role in The Boys on the small screen. The show mentions him in the first season. When Butcher and Hughie attend a support group meeting for victims of superheroes, a woman explains that Tek Knight saved her life, but his carelessness also left her paralyzed. She expresses gratitude while wishing he'd been more gentle, disgusting Billy Butcher. Tek Knight's armor has never appeared in the series. He appears to have superpowers in this iteration, almost certainly provided by Compound V. He properly appears in Gen V, where he conducts a bogus investigation to bury Vought's complicity in Golden Boy's suicide. Tek Knight's superhuman senses allow him to sniff out several hidden truths, including the fact that Jordan Li stopped Golden Boy instead of Marie Moreau. He attempts to lay the blame on Dean Indira Shetty, but Shetty blackmails him into changing his story. This version of the character still has paraphillia, leading to him frequently pleasuring himself with various inanimate objects. Whether a tumor is involved remains unknown. His most recent appearance saw him promote his upcoming film, a parody of Matt Reeves' The Batman.\n\nCould Tek Knight become more important in The Boys?\n\nClose\n\nThe Boys season 4 is quickly becoming the turning point in the franchise. The most recent episode (at the time of this writing) depicts Homelander proudly informing his allies that the supes will no longer be celebrities. They'll now be \"wrathful gods.\" Homelander has finally abandoned his desire to be loved, choosing instead to impose his will upon the world through brute strength. Tek Knight popped up a couple of times in season 4, and he's set to appear again in future installments. This could finally be the season that fans get to see Tek Knight in action.\n\nTek Knight is a one-off joke character in The Boys comics. He exists to make a bunch of jokes about men having sex with objects, then die in an embarrassing way. The Boys and Gen V series handle him in a slightly more interesting way by leaning into the Batman-style detective gimmick. With him back to join Homelander's campaign of terror, Tek Knight might suddenly become much more important. Someone should probably recommend he get an MRI while he's there. It would be pretty ironic if the guy with superhuman senses died from failing to notice a fist-sized tumor in his head.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys: Homelander Feels Less Intimidating Than Ever\n\nHomelander has always been a menacing presence on The Boys, however, the latest season makes him less intimidating than ever before.", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_kristian_mccoy@gamerant.com", "name": "Joshua Kristian McCoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Vernon,_1st_Baron_Lyveden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Vernon, 1st Baron Lyveden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_(TV_pilot)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquaman (TV pilot)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wonder Woman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_commentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social commentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Flash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Art_History/Online_Courses", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Art History/Online Courses", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tek-knight-gen-v-boys-cropped.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The episode highlights Homelander's suspicion towards Neuman, who he believes is responsible for Edgar's escape from prison. Meanwhile, Tek Knight invites Hughie to visit the Tek Cave, which leads to uncomfortable situations and revelations. Annie and Kimiko convince Mother's Milk to join them in breaking into Tek Knight's mansion to save Hughie, while Butcher continues to hallucinate Becca.\n\nLast week's episode of The Boys Season 4 delivered one of the series' most heart-breaking moments to date, as Hughie (Jack Quaid) was forced to euthanize his newly V-ed-up father (Simon Pegg) after Hugh Sr. hysterically caused havoc in the hospital. In the meantime, Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and The Boys are forced to forge an uneasy alliance with former Vought CEO Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) and VP-elect Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) to escape an estate where the latter had been testing animals with Compound V and the Supe-killing virus. This storyline concluded with Butcher kidnapping Neuman's lover Sameer (Omid Abtahi), forcing him to make more Compound V.\n\nThe Seven were also quite busy, promoting their exhaustingly expansive slate of Vought original movies and shows at their \"fan-run\" expo V52, but backstage chaos erupted as Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) suspected that A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) was behind the leaks outside of Homelander's (Antony Starr) trial. The speedster ends up finally coming to a truce with Ashley (Colby Minifie), framing VNN newsman Cameron Coleman (Matthew Edison) for the leak. As a result, Homelander rounded up the Seven alongside Gen V's Cate Dunlap (Maddie Phillips) and Sam Riordan (Asa Germann), to take turns beating Coleman to death. Episode 6 of Season 4 is titled \"Dirty Business,\" and delivers one of the series' grossest and kinkiest episodes to date. Whether or not all of it works is another story in itself, but it is certainly one trip to the Tek Cave that you won't forget.\n\nThe Boys TV-MASuperheroAction Sci-FiDramaCrime\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019 Creator Eric Kripke Cast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash Main Genre Superhero Seasons 4 Studio Amazon Studios Expand Mother's Milk Has An Awkward Encounter With Webweaver in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 6\n\nThe episode opens with Billy Butcher and Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) interrogating Sameer, who they now have chained up in an abandoned warehouse. The scientist is initially resistant, but Butcher continues to inflict pain on him by poking the stub where his leg was amputated. Butcher tells him he has only a matter of weeks to make the serum, or he'll kill him. It is also apparent that Butcher's illness is worsening.\n\nPaying tribute to Hugh Sr. and to spread his ashes, Hughie and Daphne (Rosemarie DeWitt) go on a walking tour through the streets of New York to visit the sets of the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan. Annie (Erin Moriarty) is also on the tour and is harassed by a Hometruther, shouting \"Abortion is murder.\" Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) attempts to visit Frenchie (Tomer Capone) in prison, but is turned away, with the guard claiming that \"he refuses visitation.\"\n\nFirecracker (Valorie Curry) has now taken over Cameron Coleman's timeslot on VNN, where she continues to spout absurd conspiracy theories. Firecracker reports that Coleman is on sabbatical, despite having been a part of his murder. Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) is watching the broadcast but is interrupted by a call from A-Train, who tells him he's in Toronto, revealing the truth about Coleman. MM is worried that Homelander has begun using Supes as his private military, and tells The Boys that Sister Sage was seen talking to Tek Knight (Derek Wilson) about the potential rebellion. He tasks the team with breaking into a gala being held at Tek Knight's estate, by getting Hughie to disguise as the arachnid-powered Supe Webweaver (Dan Mousseau). MM goes to Webweaver's rundown apartment, giving him opioids as a payment. Webweaver, already high off of other substances, asks MM to inject the drugs into his \"web-shooting\" hole, located right above his butt, and then falls unconscious. Hughie walks into the apartment and helps MM steal Webweaver's costume.\n\nHughie Takes a Trip to the TekCave in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 5\n\nHomelander and Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) arrive at Tek Knight's mansion for his gala, alongside a confident Firecracker, an annoyed Sister Sage, and an uncomfortable A-Train. Speaker of the House Calhoun (David Andrews) approaches the father-and-son, expressing his excitement about the young Supe one day joining The Seven. Homelander is then approached by Tek Knight, who talks about a future \"team-up,\" but Homelander says that his and Sister Sage's rebellion is not a \"team-up.\"\n\nHughie puts on the Webweaver costume in front of The Boys and complains about this foul smell, which MM assures him will help throw Tek Knight off their scent. Hughie walks into Tek Knight's mansion wearing the costume and is shocked to find The Seven in attendance. While planting bugs around the party, Hughie is caught by Neuman, who fails to recognize him. Tek Knight approaches the disguised Hughie, also unable to recognize him, having also never previously met Webweaver. Tek Knight talks about his excitement over hiring Webweaver as his sidekick, much to Hughie's confusion. Neuman walks up to Homelander and Sister Sage, complaining about the gala. Homelander tells her that Sage will be hosting a sidebar at the Gala, intoxicating the ultrarich GOP donors into invoking the 25th Amendment. Once Sage leaves, Homelander implies that he suspects that Neuman broke Edgar out of prison.\n\nTek Knight invites Hughie to visit the Tek Cave, which is hidden underneath his library, cutting off his contact with The Boys. The TekCave is no Batcave, and, much to Hughie's discomfort, is filled with BDSM paraphernalia. Tek Knight berates his butler, Elijah (Tyrone Benskin), for failing to clean the cave properly. In The Boys' van, a panicked Annie expresses that they need to go inside the mansion, fearing Hughie's fate. Hughie, going into panic mode, finds a stranger tied up in a red gimp suit, and is informed that he was Tek Knight's \"last sidekick.\" Meanwhile, The Deep (Chace Crawford) finds Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) drinking sak\u00e9 maskless. Noir talks about how he feels unimportant to the team, and not being able to grasp Noir's bizarre personality, including his obsession with Buster Beaver. He then reveals to The Deep that he is quitting The Seven, and convinces him to stay by threatening him.\n\nAnnie and Kimiko finally convince Mother's Milk to join them in breaking into Tek Knight's mansion, fearing that Hughie will be exposed and killed. Butcher, in another episode, hallucinates Becca (Shantel VanSanten), where she questions his end goal of killing Homelander only to stand with another. Neuman imagines blowing up her own head while listening to Calhoun mansplaining abortion. Expressing her growing frustration to Sage, the brainy Supe replies by telling her story from her youth, when she created a cure for her grandmother's cancer only to be laughed off by the establishment. Elijah and Tek Knight present Hughie with a German Chocolate Cake, claiming that Webweaver enjoys the feeling the texture gives to his bare cheeks. Tek Knight chains himself up and forces Hughie to sit on the cake with his bare butt and fart into it. Ashley arrives down the elevator, revealing that she is a part of Tek Knight's playtime before he offers Hughie sandpaper to wipe his cake-smeared behind.\n\nHomelander Plans to Invoke the 25th Amendment in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 6\n\nKessler continues to chide Butcher about Sameer's resistance, before reflecting on his PTSD and saying that being a stay-at-home father wasn't his true self, the real version of himself likes inflicting pain. Tek Knight begins tickling Hughie's feet with a feather while Ashley whips him and insults him. Tek Knight references that Webweaver has a safe word, which makes Hughie shout out random words such as \"spiderweb\" and \"tarantula\" in the hopes of getting it right. Firecracker, feeling insecure about herself and dismissed by Sage and Homelander, runs into Annie while exiting the bathroom. Annie begins to apologize to Firecracker for bullying her as a child. Just as Firecracker seems ready to forgive her, Annie stabs her in the neck. Tek Knight begins to suspect that Hughie is in the Webweaver suit, quizzing him on his safeword and realizing that he doesn't have the Supe's signature \"web-shooter.\" He unmasks Hughie and takes out several surgical instruments, planning to torture him.\n\nMM and Kimiko discover Sister Sage rummaging through Tek Knight's library, resulting in MM holding the Supe at gunpoint. Sage begins to mock MM about his daughter, causing him to shoot her in the head out of sheer rage, just as Kimiko activates the elevator to the Tek Cave. In shock at his actions, MM collapses, causing Kimiko to convince A-Train to take him to a hospital. Annie and Kimiko then take the elevator to the Tek Cave and attack Tek Knight before he harms Hughie. As A-Train sets MM on a gurney outside the hospital, he sees a young boy watching him in awe, and the two exchange smiles.\n\nHomelander finds a now conscious Sage, tending to her head wound, demanding whether or not she knows where the other members of The Seven went. Sage ignores his questions while talking in childish gibberish. As A-Train returns to the estate, Homelander begins to talk in front of the intoxicated GOP donors, claiming that President-elect Robert Singer (Jim Beaver) will destroy the country, claiming that Neuman is on their side. Homelander then reveals that he wants them to invoke the 25th Amendment, which would make Neuman the new President. The donors begin questioning Homelander's plan, causing him to become increasingly agitated. He turns to Sage to have her reveal that she's the mastermind, but turns around to find her shoving cake into her mouth. Neuman then steps in, claiming that she is the mastermind, denouncing democracy, promising the GOP donors that she will make sure that their businesses will receive zero government interference.\n\nKessler's Shocking Secret Is Revealed in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 6\n\nHaving freed Hughie, Annie and Kimiko have now tied up Tek Knight and proceeded to stab him, which only arouses him. Tek Knight's former sidekick breaks free from his restraints and hands Hughie his laptop. Having gained access to all of Tek Knight's bank accounts, the three begin to send all of his money to liberal causes, including an Elizabeth Warren Super-Pac, the Innocence Project, and Black Lives Matter. Tek Knight finally breaks down, revealing that Sage and Homelander are using him to gain access to his privately owned prisons so that they can turn them into internment camps for their dissenters. Elijah sneaks behind Tek Knight and begins strangling him to death, letting Annie, Hughie, and Kimiko get away.\n\nAt the hospital, MM is told that he suffered a panic attack and needs to stop whatever he's doing that is making him stressed before he gets a real heart attack. Kimiko returns to the prison where Frenchie is being held and tells the guard that she has nowhere else to go.\n\nThe next day, Homelander questions Firecracker about her sudden disappearance at the gala, and in turn, she reveals that she was attacked by Starlight and that Tek Knight is now dead, believing Annie was behind it. Annie accuses Sister Sage of lying to Homelander about the leak while criticizing Sage's competence. Homelander questions whether Firecracker is the true leak, which she denies. She tells Homelander that he gave her a platform where she can continue to spread propaganda about him and Vought, before telling him that he is \"everything to her.\" Firecracker begins to unzip her costume, which Homelander quickly turns down, claiming he is not sexually attracted to her. However, Firecracker replies that it isn't about sex, but about loyalty, and proceeds to spray him with her breast milk. While not pregnant, Firecracker reveals that she has been taking drugs to produce milk for Homelander and begins to breastfeed him.\n\nHughie and Annie watch a recording of Neuman's speech. Annie tries to talk to Hughie, but he is too paralyzed by what happened to him at the Tek Cave. Hughie confides in her, telling her that he is \"not fine.\" The episode ends with Butcher bringing Sameer the material to create the virus. The scientist tearfully confesses that creating a strain of the virus powerful enough to kill Homelander would be unstable and become airborne, killing every single Supe on Earth. Butcher hears Becca's voice saying \"Annie, Kimiko, Ryan.\" Butcher begins having a moral crisis by the news, but Kessler is excited, claiming that the virus is their \"silver bullet.\" Becca begins arguing directly with Kessler, confusing Butcher. Kessler then reveals that he too is just a figment of Butcher's imagination.\n\nWhile the previous two episodes offered some of the strongest storylines of the series yet, this week's episode felt like a pretty big step backward. While it's not truly terrible and offers some great scenes, including A-Train rescuing MM, most of this episode relied almost entirely on shocking the audience with gross-out gags. Shock value isn't a new concept to The Boys. It has become synonymous with the series, but this episode took things to a whole other level. The entire Tek Cave BDSM scene and MM's interactions with Webweaver felt like they were stretched out for far too long. Even the Season 3 episode \"Herogasm,\" showed restraint. Despite its grimness, The Boys is not entertaining, but this episode just pushed things way too far.\n\nThe political commentary also just felt off in the episode, with the references to real-life politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and AOC being jarring. Eric Kripke and Starr have done a brilliant job at making Homelander into this universe's version of Donald Trump, but name-dropping real-life politicians takes you completely out of the show. This episode isn't without some merit. Firecracker's reveal at the end of the episode is just as memorable as when Stormfront professed her Nazism in Season 2. Curry may just be this season's secret weapon. Doumit also gives a remarkable performance as Neuman as her character goes through a crisis of her own, proving she is almost as unpredictable as Homelander himself.\n\nREVIEW The Boys\n\nSeason 4, Episode 6 of The Boys feels like a giant step backward from the previous two episodes, relying too much on shock value.\n\n410\n\nProsClaudia Doumit and Valorie Curry are excellent and easily this episode's biggest stand-outs.

As you may recall, last week's episode was total farm-ageddon as the team battled a group of seriously V-d-up animals, Hughie lost his dad and Vought news anchor Cameron Coleman was beaten to death by The Seven.\n\nThis week, the titular team infiltrate an alt-right cocktail party, which quickly takes a pretty nasty turn - strap in folks, this is easily the most NSFW episode of the entire fourth season. Elsewhere, Butcher is having his own issues trying to create more doses of the anti-Supe Virus, with a shocking twist that sets up future episodes.\n\nWith that, there's plenty to unpack, so join us as we dive right into The Boys season 4 episode 6. Warning! The following features plenty of spoilers for The Boys season 4 episode 6, so make sure you have watched the latest episode before reading on!\n\nWe pick up with Butcher, Joe Kessler, and their hostage Sameer, as the former two put pressure on the latter to make more doses of the anti-Supe Virus. The duo give him a week to \"make something strong enough to top Homelander\".\n\nElsewhere, Hughie, alongside his mom and the rest of The Boys, scatter his late father's ashes on the Maid in Manhattan tour - it's what he would have wanted. Kimiko then goes to visit Frenchie in jail but she is told he refused her visitation, while MM receives a call from a panicking A-Train who informs him about Coleman's death and demands a meeting.\n\nThe Boys come up with a plan to infiltrate an alt-right party at Tek Knight's estate which is the main setting of the episode, where Hughie poses as drug-addicted Supe Webweaver. That's a pretty dangerous move given that The Seven are also at the gathering... And like with any party, there's plenty of awkward conversation as Tek brags to the working class Firecracker about being rich and discusses his family's slave-owning past with A-Train.\n\nHughie manages to successfully get into the manor where he plants several bugs, before Tek invites him to his 'Tek Cave' to audition to be his side-kick. In truth, the cave is a grim sex dungeon and Hughie is in trouble, as Tek and Vought's Ashley subject him to their increasingly toe-curling kinks. Before long, Tek senses something's off and unmasks Hughie, then threatens to make holes in his body to well, penetrate them.\n\nConcerned about the radio silence from Hughie, Annie, Kimiko, and MM head into the party themselves. There, Annie encounters Firecracker who is upset over Sage and Homelander ignoring her all night. Annie apologizes for her past actions before drugging Firecracker to remove her from the scene.\n\nKimiko and MM then come across Sage, who begins to make digs at his family. Things escalate to the point of MM shooting the Supe in the head, but has a panic attack following her comments and passes out. Seeking help, Kimiko brings A-Train into the room, encouraging him to get MM to safety. He drops MM off at a local hospital, where he encounters a young boy excited to see the hero, giving A-Train a sense of fulfilment.\n\nAnnie and Kimiko finally reach the dungeon where they save a traumatized Hughie and torture Tek by donating all his money to charities he hates, such as Black Lives Matter. Eventually Tek breaks, revealing to The Boys that Homelander wants to turn his private prisons into internment camps, which causes his long-serving butler to murder him.\n\n\"I've cleaned cum out of more holes than you can believe, but internment camps?!\" he says, having throttled his former boss and revealing that the safe word was \"Zendaya\". Good to know the guy has some sort of conscious...\n\nAlso at the party, Homelander's plan to convince a bunch of rich assholes to support The Seven's power-hungry schemes is thrown off course thanks to Sage's brain damage following the shooting. He takes things into his own hands giving a lecture on how useless politician Robert Singer is, and asking those in the room to invoke the 25th amendment which will give Homelander significant power. After facing some backlash Neuman steps in, winning them over with a strong speech.\n\nMeanwhile at Vought Tower, the actor portraying Black Noir expresses to The Deep his frustrations about being part of The Seven, emphasizing that he wants to quit. However, The Deep convinces him to stay by opening up about how killing turned the previous Black Noir on, saying \"violence is power\".\n\nFollowing the party, Homelander asks Firecracker where she was that night - she tells him that Annie was there and Tek is dead, revealing that Coleman isn't the leak after all. Wanting to demonstrate her love to Homelander, she invites him to breastfeed from her which, well, certainly wins him over. If there's one thing Homelander likes, it's breast milk.\n\nDuring the episode, Butcher is also having his own struggles, talking to an imaginary Becca and his friend Joe about what to do with Ryan. In the final scenes, we once again see Billy and Joe put Samir under pressure to create another dose of the virus. He reveals that a drug strong enough to kill Homelander would evolve into something unstable, airborne, highly contagious, and lethal to every Supe on Earth - including Ryan.\n\nJoe is delighted by the news telling Butcher this is how they wipe them all out, but the imaginary Becca tells him not to go along with this. Then it happens - as Becca and Joe starting arguing with each other, Butcher realizes that the latter only exists in his head too. Imaginary Kessler confirms this, saying that Butcher left the real Joe to die and that he killed Ezekiel (who mysteriously died earlier on in the season). The final shot of Butcher's face says it all - this can't be good at all.\n\nWebweaver: This Supe makes his debut in the episode, as The Boys steal his superhero outfit so Hughie can wear it as a disguise at the party. In the comics Webweaver is a Spider-Man parody, able to create his own organic web. Not much else is known about the Supe there given his reserved personality but we do know that his death ultimately led to the creation of The Boys team.\n\nTek Knight: Following his appearance in episode 5, this Supe certainly has his impact on this installment as we enter his Tek Cave a.k.a. his horrific sex dungeon. For more on the Iron Man inspired Supe, check out our who is Tek Knight guide.\n\nLaddio: When Hughie enters the Tek Cave, he spots another person gagged and tied up in the corner of the room. We can safely assume this is Laddio, who is Tek Knight's side-kick in the comics and a parody of Batman's Robin. Here whilst Tek calls him a \"side-kick\" he is a sex slave who eventually breaks free from his chains to help The Boys torture the Supe.\n\nThe anti-Supe Virus: This has been mentioned a few times this season but here we learn that it could potentially cause a pandemic that might kill off every Supe on the planet. It first introduced in spin-off show Gen V and you can learn more about it with our Supe Virus guide.\n\n120 Days of Sodom: When Kimiko is searching for how to open the door to Tek Knight's dungeon, she comes across this book by writer Marquis de Sade. The unfinished novel is often cited as being one of the most obscene stories ever, following four men as they seek the ultimate sexual gratification. It's placement here then ties in well with what goes on in the Tek Cave.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 episodes 1 - 6 are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video right now with new episodes dropping every Thursday.

He needs to go undercover to attend a Federalist Society gathering to honor Homelander (Antony Starr) at Tek Knight's Bruce Wayne-like estate.\n\nWearing the costume of The Boys' Supe informant Webweaver, Hughie goes to the function to find out about nefarious plans Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) and Tek (Derek Wilson) have in the works. Hoping to lure Tek away from the party so The Boys can interrogate him, Hughie is instead lured by Tek down to the \"Tek Cave,\" which is his BDSM dungeon.\n\nSuddenly, Hughie finds himself in a precarious situation that involves Tek's S&M partner Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) -- and things get weird fast.\n\nNote: The next section contains major spoilers from the episode.\n\nBilly Butcher (Karl Urban) and Joe Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) are holding Vought scientist Sameer (Omid Abtahi) captive after immobilizing him by amputating one of his legs. Butcher orders Sameer to create more of the virus that will infect and kill Homelander.\n\nLater, an ailing Butcher returns to The Boys' headquarters, where he's once again visited by the specter of Becca (Shantel VanSanten), who asks Butcher why he cut off an innocent man's leg in another act of \"blood lust.\" Becca also questions Butcher's motivation for killing Homelander, which she says will only result in another Homelander-like Supe taking his place.\n\nReturning to see Sameer, the scientist tells Butcher that the virus would kill all Supes, including his allies Annie (Erin Moriarty), Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and Becca's son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti). Butcher realizes he would be committing global genocide but Joe pushes back. When Joe suddenly starts talking to the apparatition of Becca, Butcher has a startling revelation that's related to his terminal illness.\n\nHughie and Daphne (Rosemarie DeWitt) memorialize Hugh Sr. on the streets of New York City. Per Hugh Sr.'s wish, Hughie and Daphne spread his ashes during a walking tour of the filming location of the Jennifer Lopez movie Maid in Manhattan in New York City. Joining them on the tour are Annie, Kimiko, and Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso).\n\nKimiko tries to visit Frenchie (Tomer Capone) in jail after he admitted to committing the murders of his boyfriend Colin's (Elliot Knight) family years before, but Frenchie refuses visitors.\n\nFirecracker (Valorie Curry) steps in as \"interim anchor\" of the Vought News Network after Cameron Coleman (Matthew Edison) goes on \"sabbatical.\" Coleman isn't coming back, though, since he was executed at the hands of The Seven in Episode 5 when he was accused of leaking the video data from The Seven's Crime Analytics Division. The data, of course, exonerated two Starlighters charged with killing three Home Teamers.\n\nFreaking out over Coleman's execution, A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) calls Mother's Milk and tells him of the Federalist Party gathering. Mother's Milk shares A-Train's intel about Homelander assembling an army of Supes.\n\nBlack Noir II (Nathan Mitchell) unmasks himself and gripes to The Deep (Chace Crawford) about not being invited to the Federalist Society gathering while downing a bottle of sake.\n\nA-Train saves Mother's Milk from what is believed to be a heart attack while he's trying to rescue Hughie from the Tek Cave. While dropping off Mother's Milk at the hospital, a young boy standing outside looks at the Supe in wonder because he's seen a superhero in action, making A-Train smile knowing he's done something good with his powers.\n\nKimiko and Annie save Hughie from the Tek Cave and make Tek Knight pay both physically and monetarily by gaining access to his bank account making multi-million dollar donations to social justice organizations. Tek spills the plan and tells them that Homelander and Sister Sage have made a deal with him to put their \"dissidents\" into his private prisons all over the country.\n\nFirecracker surprises Homelander by revealing she's been taking lactation pills. As such Firecracker becomes Homelander's new wet nurse -- a la Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue) in previous seasons of The Boys -- and provides him with a new supply of breastmilk. The idea seemingly is for Firecracker to keep Homelander under control as the late Stillwell did or at the very least keep the Supe from killing her.\n\nAfter a mostly political-free episode in Episode 5, The Boys creator Eric Kripke once again infuses politics into Episode 6, but mostly in a way that works within the context of the story and doesn't feel preachy.\n\nAs such, Kripke satirizes a right-wing conspiracy theory during Firecracker's VNN appearance, but the purpose of the Federalist Society gathering is to have Sister Sage convince the most powerful politicians in the room to commit high treason and invoke the 25th Amendment so Vice President-elect and secret Supe Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) can become president. From a narrative standpoint, it drives the storyline of Season 4 forward.\n\nKripke also inserts some hot-button political issues into the scenes at Tek Knight's estate by having Senator Calhoun (David Andrews) explain to Victoria Neuman why he backs a nationwide abortion ban, which makes Victoria's head literally explode (but in a fantasy sequence). Again, though, the scene works from a narrative standpoint since it convinces Victoria that she needs to go along with Sister Sage's plan to participate in the government coup.\n\nWhile Episode 5 largely brought back the excessive gore in a laugh-out funny way (flying feral sheep -- what's not to love?), Kripke's BDSM scenes in Tek Knight's dungeon amplifies the bizarre sexual perversion of The Boys that puts The Human Centipede-like cringe scene in Episode 2 this season to shame. In short, the Tek Cave scenes are revolting and ultimately far more disgusting than the laugh-out stupid scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey.\n\nAnd adding to the weirdness, of course, is the return of Homelander's obsession with breastmilk, which is one of the most bizarre ongoing storylines of the entire series.\n\nWhile The Boys Season 4 continues to be uneven in tone from episode to episode, at least Episode 6 resulted in some interesting takeaways that raise the stakes for Season 4 as it drives toward its conclusion.\n\nWeirdness aside, at least Kripke is displaying some great storytelling sensibilities with the Billy Butcher-Joe Kessler twist and revealing more details about Homelander's plans to turn the country upside down by installing Victoria Neuman as president. Dirty Business may not be the best episode of Season 4, but at least it's one of the most creative from a storytelling standpoint.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federalist Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Minifie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colby Minifie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_Abtahi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omid Abtahi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantel_VanSanten", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shantel VanSanten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elliot Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Pegg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simon Pegg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BDSM"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Shades_of_Grey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fifty Shades of Grey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadomasochism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

The word just makes people feel safe,\" she tells a bunch of superheroes and donors at a tight-knit right-wing fundraiser. She emphasizes that nations don't exist and corporations run the country, name-dropping Apple, Exxon, and Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nVictoria promises the billionaires in attendance they can basically operate without laws if they support her and help overthrow POTUS-elect Robert Singer (Jim Beaver). And so a dangerous coup is underway. Or as Homelander (Antony Starr) frames it, they're replacing Singer and his woke mob before they let transgender liberals take over. (Yes, I had to take several deep breaths during these scenes.) They're apparently playing a long game instead of Homelander or any Supe killing Singer and pretending he died of natural causes. Sure.\n\nThe bullshit spewed at this cocktail event is to tell rich people what they want to hear. Of course, democracy isn't crap, and the masses aren't idiots. The system is just fucked. Whether in actual life or The Boys, the culprit is an imbalance of power that benefits the one-percent while the people, or \"the labor force,\" as Victoria calls them, suffer. Real-world politics have forced us all to ponder the meaning of democracy though especially because the last election cycle ended with an insurrection and the upcoming one is already in shambles. Not to mention, the Supreme Court gave Trump some amount of immunity earlier this week, while Homelander casually mentions that the Justice Department appointees are in their pocket. (Kudos to Starr for making Homelander multifaceted in his villainy considering the actor expressed a desire to add more layers to his performance when asked about comparisons to Trump. But also: If the shoe fits...)\n\nPerhaps this speaks more to the state of our governance, or that Prime Video's drama has overstayed its welcome, or that it has forgotten to enjoy its actual superhero content. This has sucked the fun out of what the writing was great at satirizing. Homelander was always meant to be feared (even if we laughed at the implications of his growing power) because he is a powerful, evil, racist misogynist with a superiority complex -- no law can stop him if he wears the flag and parades his false patriotism. So dubbing him as the \"symbol of America\" in this episode feels bleak. And if their coup occurs on January 6 (because when else will Vic take over Singer?), someone let Eric Kripke know being too on the nose doesn't make for interesting storytelling.\n\nWhile Victoria and Homelander are luring the elite, this fundraiser has plenty of other shit going down that no one, not even Homelander's super hearing, is aware of. I hope you weren't watching \"Dirty Business\" with much company because it is possibly one of The Boys' most NSFW episodes. It's on par with \"Herogasm\" and Termite (Brett Geddes) shrinking himself to enter his lover's urethra in the season-three premiere. Is there a point to any of the madness besides the show trying to make our jaws drop? If there is, I don't see it.\n\nThere's a deeper understanding of how Tek Knight (Derek Wilson) operates. In case you needed a reminder: Robert Vernon, a.k.a. Tek Knight, is a shrewd detective superhero and Godolkin U alum who hosts various shows for Vought+. He even showed up in Gen V and has been a bigger presence in season four of The Boys, even if it's related mostly to the movies he stars in. But \"Dirty Business\" allows us to know him better through the eyes of Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid). Still mourning his dad's death, Hughie volunteers to go undercover at the fundraiser as Web Weaver, who scored an invite. He regrets his decision immediately because Tek and Ashley (Colby Minifie) pull a masked Hughie into their sex games. Hughie, a total trouper, goes through with it.\n\nI don't necessarily want to revisit every single thing Hughie experiences for their pleasure, and it's impressive the cast made it through filming it all, but my jaw was already on the floor when he was made to sit on the chocolate cake, rub his ass on it, and fart. No kink-shaming will be tolerated -- to each their own -- but the entire time I kept thinking of how Hughie is handling this emotionally. The man just sprinkled his dad's ashes on Manhattan's dirty sidewalks earlier that day. And it only gets worse for him after Ashley enters in her dom avatar, licking his feet and whatnot. So I'm glad \"Dirty Business\" closes with a relatively human moment of Hughie breaking down and telling Annie (Erin Moriarty) he's not okay. How the hell can he be? Much has been said in these recaps about his contribution to the team, but I'm glad The Boys has leveled him up.\n\nHughie is saved when Annie and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) find Tek Knight's lair. They fight off Sage and Firecracker (Valorie Curry) to get there, but they make it in time to torture Tek to find out why he's teaming up with the Seven. But how do you make a masochist Conservative talk? Starlight figures out no pain is worse for him than donating $100 million of his money to Black Lives Matter or $65 million to the Innocence Project. So that's how they learn that Homelander and Sage are attempting to set up internment camps. Who knows what horrors they have in store?\n\nWell, Homeander will have to carry on their plan by himself because Sage's superpowered brain is currently in crisis mode. She gets shot in the head by MM (Laz Alonso) when she's trying to stop the Boys from invading Tek Knight's lair. It results in a seemingly longterm problem, not like the kind her lobotomy was causing. Does it mean she's done forever as a Supe? If yes, that's disappointing because The Boys could do so much with a hero who found the cure for cancer in three days. Anyway, she's being replaced by Firecracker, who serves up her breastmilk to Homelander knowing it's his weakness. That shot of him sucking it off of her tits was a classic reminder of Madelyn Stillwell (Elizabeth Shue) and of the fact that The Boys always goes boldly where no other TV show has gone before.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

This show, about a superhero group called The Seven, couldn't be further from the comic-book movies that dominate cinemas; the MCU wouldn't dream of being this transgressive. Shock factor is practically ingrained in the show's DNA -- whether it's extreme violence and gore, or the vicious lampooning of alt-right politics, the show, created by Eric Kripke, is never afraid to \"go there.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the show's plentiful sex scenes, outrageousness seems to be the show's mission statement. Let's not forget the infamous Season 3 premiere when one supe exploded inside another man's penis, killing him instantly. That seemed to set off a theme: There was even an exploding penis moment in the Boys spin-off series, Gen V. Heck, just a few episodes ago on The Boys, there was a moment that's best described as a rimming train in the vein of The Human Centipede. Its plethora of penetration is often gasp-worthy, but even the raunchiest sex in The Boys is brief. Or at least it was. In Episode 6, \"Dirty Business,\" The Boys tops itself (pun intended) with its longest and single most outrageous sex scene to date.\n\nThe scene takes place in the home of Tek Knight (Derek Wilson), an uber-wealthy supe who's invited leading politicians and The Seven to his home for a party. Hughie (Jack Quaid) and the Boys want in so they can figure out The Seven's secret plan. To infiltrate the party, Hughie has to assume the identity of Tek Knight's potential new sidekick Web Weaver, who conveniently has a super suit that covers his entire body, therefore hiding Hughie's identity.\n\nTek takes Hughie on a tour of his mansion, and when they're alone, he asks Hughie if he wants to see the Tek Cave. While I was expecting a high-tech secret base \u00e0 la the Bat Cave, with remarkable surveillance possibilities and world-class gadgetry, Tek's secret haven is actually a seedy sex dungeon. And I do mean seedy -- dildos, masks, ropes, and whips adorn the walls. There's a urinal that looks like it needed a deep clean two decades ago. Some things in the room would make even the kinkiest person blush, including a medieval torture device (a gibbet cage) and various other objects that defy description. There's even Tek's old sidekick, chained to the wall in a red gimp suit. And things only get weirder from there.\n\nThe next time the episode shows Tek's cave, Tek is self-asphyxiating off a chain hanging from the ceiling -- and while this is happening, he prompts Hughie to sit on a chocolate cake. Tek is delighted as Hughie hesitantly puts his bare ass on the cake. \"Smush it,\" he commands, which Hughie does. \"Now, fart,\" Tek orders. Hughie does, and a look of ecstasy flashes on Tek's face: \"That's fucking hot,\" he snarls.\n\nWhat's remarkable about this unhinged cornucopia of sexual fetish is that it never seeks to kink-shame, instead taking these sexual taboos at face value. It's funny, sure, but the laughs come from the sheer outlandishness of the scenario Hughie has found himself in, rather than the specific desires on display. Things are weird, but it's the weirdness, rather than people getting off on unexpected things, that's amusing. In the cake moment, laughter is almost a defense mechanism. It's not funny because Tek is turned on, but rather because Hughie is so uncomfortable that chuckling is the only way to make the scene palatable. It's worth noting too that Tek believes it's Web Weaver behind the mask, not Hughie. As far as he's concerned, Web Weaver is more than happy to play along with his sexual proclivities, in order to become his sidekick. The reality that it's actually Hughie, who is deeply opposed to participating in every second of the ordeal makes this more complicated and infinitely more queasy.\n\nIf the cake felt like too much, things ramp up into overdrive when Ashley (Colby Minifie), Vought CEO and close friend of Tek, enters the cave. It turns out their relationship runs way deeper than a mere friendship. To the dulcet tones of Chrisopher Cross' soft-rock \"Sailing,\" Hughie is chained on all fours on a leather chair, feet exposed. Ashley, now wearing a black latex dominatrix outfit, tickles Hughie's feet with a feather, threatening to piss all over his face.\n\nAshley clearly relishes the role of the dom, delivering unforgettable (and extremely graphic) lines like \"I'm gonna bite your dick off and cook it. I am 100 percent a cannibal\" and \"I'm going to feel your pink asshole around my wrist until you shit.\" It proves to be too much for Hughie, who begs for her to stop -- but he doesn't know Web Weaver's safe word so he continues concealing his identity as the antics wear on.\n\n'Interview With the Vampire' Stars Unpack That Shocking Finale Twist\n\nThe sequence begins as amusing, but grows increasingly uncomfortable as Hughie becomes terrified over the situation he's in. It's clear Tek is truly balls-to-the-wall, and uses sex as a sort of weapon. There's no guarantee that Hughie will survive this interaction. The Boys is a show that viewers expect to feel uneasy while watching, but seeing Hughie earnestly beg and plead for the sexual escapades to stop while Ashley and Tek parade on, believing it's all part of a sexual fantasy they're all in on, is more extreme than the show has ever been.\n\nThe punchline of the scene comes as Ashley achieves orgasm while tickling Hughies feet, and goes over to make out with Tek in the throws of passion and debauchery. The camera pulls back to a medium shot, revealing them kissing over Hughie's rigid, traumatized body. She wipes her bodily fluids on Hughie's mask, and he limply says, \"Thank you so much.\" The sequence is simultaneously upsetting, hilarious, disgusting, and respectful. And it's gotta be seen to be believed.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Well, odds are Tek Knight's big bash is probably not going to be what anyone expects.\n\nIn advance, what we can say about the guy is simple: He's got a Vought+ series called The Whole Truth, he fancies himself a detective and in reality, he is basically the show's version of Batman. After all, the new promo for episode 6 (watch here) hypes up what you can argue is his version of a Batcave. (Did we mention that Tek loves holes? Well, he does, in a particularly grotesque sort of way.)\n\nSo why are a lot of important characters going to be around Tek Knight now? That is an important thing to wonder, given that for The Boys in general, they are relatively adrift at the moment. After all, Butcher is the one focusing mostly on the Supe virus and really, a lot of these characters are off dealing with their own problems. Hughie's in mourning, Annie's struggling with a sudden loss of her abilities, and Frenchie just got himself arrested. Are they all basically rudderless and incapable of stopping any further plans?\n\nRemember here that for now, Homelander seems to be more enabled and empowered than ever. He also has at his side someone in Sage who can be really valuable to him -- that is, provided of course he actually listens to her. He's long had a tendency to be a \"my way or the highway\" sort of guy, though in his case \"the highway\" typically just means someone getting themselves killed.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more news on The Boys, including some other details all about what lies ahead\n\nWhat do you think we will learn about Tek in here?

But aside from the abundance of strange sexual displays and awkward scenes, you may be wondering, what is up with Tek Knight, and why does he have a... hole fetish?\n\nWarning: this article includes some major spoilers for The Boys season 4 episode 6, so make sure you have seen that before you read on!\n\nSo... that happened. In The Boys season 4 episode 6, we were treated, or rather subjected, to one of the most vulgar and kinky episodes since the likes of Herogasm in season 3. We saw Webweaver shoot whatever that was out of his web hole all over MM and at Tek Knight's house we witnessed Ashley in a latex suit and Hughie pass gas on a chocolate cake, all whilst a gimp watched on from the corner. Shiver. But perhaps the strangest thing, which is saying a lot, is the fact that Tek Knight was drawing holes into Hughie's body, revealing that he wanted to cut these out and... enter them. So, what is up with Knight's weird hole kink?\n\nI won't go into too much detail here as we have already covered who the character is and where he comes from in our Tek Knight explainer. But the gist is that Tek is an extremely rich Supe who uses his wealth to his advantage. The Bruce Wayne type also hosts various Vought shows, and as we saw in Gen V and now in The Boys, has an uncontrollable urge to stick his member into anything with a hole.\n\nSo, why does he do this? In the comics, Tek is said to suffer from paraphilia, developing an intense sexual compulsion towards any object with a hole in it as a result of having a brain tumor. This means that any human, animal, or object with a hole, is basically a goal in Tek's mind. Or even if there isn't a hole there, he seeks to make one, just as we saw with Hughie.\n\nBut believe it or not, his sexual outbursts are way worse in the comics. In one issue, he tries to have relations with a robot after seeing his rear end, and in others he sets his sights on a coffee cup, a cat, and even his sidekick. All without consent of course. Truly despicable. But Tek was outed to the local newspaper when he tried to assault his butler in his ear hole, which explains the butler's actions at the end of episode 6.\n\nIn the comics, Tek meets his end by having sex with a giant asteroid and causing it to explode, saving the planet in the process. But in actual fact he was killed by a falling wheelbarrow and hallucinated the whole meteor ordeal.\n\nSo, there you have it, that is the lowdown on Tek and everything we know about his on-screen depiction and his comic book character. Let's just hope we don't meet another Supe like him in the future!\n\nThe Boys season 4 is currently streaming on Prime Video, with new episodes dropping every Thursday.

Well, let's just put it in rather simple terms for a moment: He's hosting an event! The Seven are going to turn up, which leads to him thinking that he's a part of the team. The problem here is that clearly, Homelander does not think of him that way ... or anywhere close to it.\n\nIf you head over to TVLine, you can see a sneak preview for what lies ahead, one in which Antony Starr's character completely belittles Tek after the suggestion is brought up that they could team up. After all, Tek's abilities are just a mere fraction of what most of the Seven can do and really, a lot of his skill set is tied more to deduction and wealth. If the show wanted to show us different sides of what a \"hero\" can be, they are doing so here.\n\nBased on this preview and also the promo unveiled earlier this week, The Boys may be doing their version of a Batman / Superman spoof here where Homelander is evil Superman and Tek Knight is more Batman, someone who thinks that they can excel based solely on some fancy tricks or tools at their disposal. This is one of the classic arguments that comic-book fans have been having for years, though in the eyes of Homelander it is pretty clear at this point there is no real need for debate. After all, one of them is clearly head and shoulders above the other in terms of winning in a fight.\n\nRelated - Get more news entering this episode of The Boys, including the aforementioned promo\n\nDo you think he's going to get over this delusion of grandeur?

This was never a subtle show, but season four in particular has leaned into real-world parallels, especially when it comes to Homelander and Donald Trump. As of \"Dirty Business,\" the all-powerful white supremacist at the top has persuaded some of the richest and evilest people in America to participate in a coup on January 6 -- possibly with the on-the-ground assistance of some of the most radical right-wing Fox News (sorry, Vought News) viewers in America.\n\nDepending on your tolerance when it comes to blatantly cribbing from real life, this type of thing can be annoying in its on-the-nose-ness -- but it's also unfortunately as relevant as ever, especially considering this week's Supreme Court decision regarding presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. (\"In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \"With fear for our democracy, I dissent.\")\n\nSetting aside our own declining nation, \"Dirty Business\" is another pretty entertaining episode of The Boys. It continues the season's upward trajectory after it got a little too fragmented and too mired in misery early on. Of course the torture streak continues here in both major stories -- and personally, I could've used a little less of Tek Knight and Ashley traumatizing Hughie -- but at least all the characters feel part of the same story now.\n\nHughie has been somewhat sidelined lately, especially compared to those first two seasons, so it's nice to see him play a central role this episode. A mission to infiltrate Tek Knight's estate during a Federalist Society party offers the perfect opportunity for Hughie to pour himself into a mission and get his mind off the loss of his dad; he'll be undercover as Webweaver, Butcher and Mother's Milk's go-to informant, who scored an invite as a new candidate to be Tek's sidekick. This leads to possibly the most disgusting scene in a pretty disgusting episode with MM rectally roofie-ing Webweaver and getting facialed by a spurt of white goo from his \"web hole\" as a result. (I hated even typing that.)\n\nThere's some solid comedy in watching Hughie adopt the slang of Webweaver to impersonate him at the party, croaking out unconvincing \"dog\"s and \"no cap\"s from inside his smelly suit. As MM informs the Boys (and viewers who haven't watched Gen V), Tek Knight has extremely heightened senses, which makes him a brilliant lie detector. But Hughie manages to pull off the act and plant some bugs at the party, even after an almost disastrous run-in with Victoria Neuman and the Seven.\n\nIt's when Hughie loses signal down in the hidden \"Tek Cave\" that everything slowly goes to shit. Hughie never signed up to sit his bare ass on a German chocolate cake while a billionaire chokes and strokes himself, and he certainly didn't sign up to get tickle-tortured or pissed on. These scenes contain some effective comedy, like when Hughie starts yelping out random words -- like tarantula -- when trying to guess Webweaver's established safe word. But the dominant feeling is horror, especially the longer it goes on. It's almost a relief when Tek does finally unmask Hughie and figure out the truth, though it doesn't diminish the threat of sexual violence one bit.\n\nThankfully, Kimiko and Annie manage to sneak into the mansion, locate the secret entryway to the Tek Cave, and save Hughie in time, sparing us the sight of Tek drilling new holes into Hughie's body to stick his dick in. And with the help of Tek's former \"sidekick,\" a man in a red gimp suit, they get access to Tek's bank accounts, allowing them to finally get the truth out of him: He and Sage made a deal to use his private prisons for locking up dissidents once she and Homelander put their plan into action.\n\nAfter the shit we've seen, it would be hard to watch Tek Knight walk away from this episode alive, so it's satisfying to see his butler (and supposed father figure), Elijah, choke him to death after he hears about the camps. But this story ends on a refreshingly emotional note when Hughie starts to process his feelings and open up to Annie about what he had just experienced. \"I'm not fine\" might be a predictable line, but Jack Quaid's choked-up delivery of \"I miss my dad\" is downright heartbreaking.\n\nBut the most surprisingly moving moment of this episode, to me, concerns A-Train, who makes the risky move of leaving the party to drop MM off at the hospital after the latter shoots Sage in the head and has a heart attack. (It's actually a panic attack, which makes sense; MM has been trying to practice mindfulness, but it's impossible with all the responsibilities on his shoulders.) Noticing a wide-eyed kid who witnessed the rescue, A-Train is touched by the smile of awe on the kid's face. Just a few episodes ago, we saw this guy bragging to his nephews about people whose lives he hadn't actually saved; now, he's truly helping people, and it feels good.\n\nWhile A-Train is changing and becoming a better person, very few other people on this show seem interested in the same path. I've been curious for a while about Sage's actual belief system and motivations, so it was gratifying to hear her open up to Neuman about the moment she became radicalized: She discovered a cure to her own grandmother's leukemia at 11 years old, but she was ignored and laughed at and her grandma died. If she wanted to, she could single-handedly solve all of the world's problems, but she has no respect for humanity. So even if she doesn't have anything in common with all these fat cats, she's happy to drain their wallets and discard them when she no longer has any use for them.\n\nIt once seemed possible that Sage had some deeper hidden agenda, one that could even involve discarding Homelander eventually. (I suppose she still could.) But this monologue helps us understand her superiority complex, which is rooted in a totally different place from Homelander's. Both of them consider humans animals that should be controlled and subjugated, but Homelander has an innate sadism and scorn for human life, while Sage learned to see humans this way over years of outthinking everyone she met yet still failing to gain their respect.\n\nUnfortunately for Homelander, the bullet in Sage's head temporarily prevents her from thinking about anything beyond her Taco Bell order and which TLC show she's going to watch later, so she's no help during the exclusive meeting in which Homelander cheerfully announces his insurrection plans. But Neuman steps up to the plate, combining her political acumen (she can handle the Justice Department, the military response, and OPEC, among other practical issues) and a persuasive emotional appeal (\"The masses are fucking stupid,\" and billionaires shouldn't be regulated or restricted in any way).\n\nNeuman has been too far gone for a while, and last week's unlikely team-up didn't really change that. But Butcher has been hanging somewhere in the middle, morally speaking, for the whole show. At any given point, he has an angel on one shoulder and the Devil on another. Since the beginning of this season, his wife, Becca, has functioned as the angel, appearing to him in hallucinations. But in \"Dirty Business,\" the truth finally comes out: Joe Kessler is the Devil, and he's just as imagined as Becca. He was conjured up by Butcher's brain tumor as a manifestation of Butcher's dark, violent side that always does what needs to be done, no matter the cost. When Butcher blacked out and somehow violently tore Ezekiel apart, that was Kessler taking the wheel.\n\nViewers have been speculating about Kessler for weeks, and the reveal here is pretty well done with Kessler unmasking himself by turning and barking at Becca to shut up. It's a reaction to Sameer's head-spinning intel on the virus, which leaves Butcher with an interesting conundrum in these final two episodes: Is it worth risking the lives of supes like Kimiko, Annie, and (most important) Ryan just to take out Homelander? According to Kessler -- who speaks to a good half of Butcher's psyche -- a supe pandemic doesn't have to be an unfortunate side effect. It could be exactly what the world needs. And once you start justifying a genocide, it's hard to come back.\n\n* No sign of Frenchie, who refuses to let Kimiko visit him in jail.\n\n* \"You didn't get all the santorum off the gibbet cage!\" Wow, can't say I've heard that word in a while, but this line-reading reminded me of one of Glenn Howerton's deliveries in It's Always Sunny.\n\n* The Speaker directly parroting Todd Akin's infamous comments about \"legitimate rape\" is one real-world reference that feels a little more lazy than clever to me.\n\n* \"Firecracker, it's kind of a private conversation, but I'm sure the bar has some SunnyD and Everclear.\"\n\n* Of course the book that opens the entrance to Tek's lair is The 120 Days of Sodom.\n\n* Love the moment when Annie owns up to her mean-girl behavior on the pageant circuit and apologizes to Firecracker, only to tranq her. Pretty satisfying turn, and it doesn't detract from the sincerity of her reflecting.\n\n* Hughie, Annie, and Kimiko transfer $40 million from Tek's account to Elizabeth Warren's super-PAC along with $65 million to the Innocence Project and $100 million to Black Lives Matter. It would've been funny to see him explain those donations on Vought News the next week, but he's dead now.\n\n* Apparently Stan Edgar hasn't been seen since his release, and Homelander definitely seems suspicious of Neuman's involvement.\n\n* Firecracker is on a regimen of drugs to produce breast milk in order to please Homelander. It's working!\n\n* Pretty funny to see the new Black Noir with his mask off, admitting that he \"doesn't really like violence\" and ranting about how he's not allowed to use his flying abilities as Noir. And the scene also moves the Deep to the next phase of his Homelander-ification as he insists that \"violence is power.\" The motivation for violence, in his case, is forcing people to stop laughing at him and take him seriously.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_rosenstock@vulture.com", "name": "Ben Rosenstock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidekick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sidekick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbing_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cribbing (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federalist Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rectum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polygraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everclear (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Akin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taco Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c8a/9be/8f7e61b084b1335c7654f06dee1b8c51c8-The-Boys-Ep-6.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 429, "textEnd": 438}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Which makes Homelander, the mommy-issue-addled leader of the Seven, very happy.\n\n\"I love how that scene played so much, because we both came to it with this utter vulnerability and full of sincerity -- which just makes it so much fucking weirder,\" Curry said. \"But with Firecracker, despite her just insanity and the things that she spews, she has this uncanny ability to know what people need, whether it's in a crowd or it's one on one. And even Homelander, she can see the human inside that shell, and she can see what that human needs, even if it looks like a bizarre fetish on the outside. And she's willing to give him that also, because she's not afraid of him -- she should be. But she truly believes her vision of who he is, so she feels like she has no reason to be afraid of him, and makes herself so vulnerable to his vulnerability. It's so intimate.\"\n\nCurry said a significant amount of prep went into that scene from \"The Boys'\" costume department \"just to build the architecture to make it possible\" to depict Firecracker breastfeeding Homelander, adding: \"The supersuit team should just patent the whole situation there.\"\n\nSee below for Variety's Q&A with \"The Boys\" showrunner Eric Kripke diving deeper into the Firecracker breastfeeding scene, Tek Knight's sex dungeon and Hughie's torturous time spent pretending to be Webweaver.\n\nLet's start with the Tek Knight sex dungeon part. Where did the idea come for it? And why bring Hughie into this situation now -- kicking him when he's down by having him sexually assaulted by his childhood hero after his dad just died?\n\nWell, that's a dark way to look at it! We view it as hilarious. Obviously, Tek Knight is our version of Batman, and we wanted to really play around with that trope: Batman's fascist underpinnings as a really wealthy dude who hunts poor people, and then profits of the incarceration. So that was one. Tek Knight was already set up to be a freak, so we were kind of already halfway there. Then the notion came up of, he should have a Batcave -- but let's be honest, the Batcave would be a sex dungeon. Like, even the real Batcave is just this side of being a sex dungeon. It's really dark, and there's rubber suits everywhere. It's not that much of a push to add a couple dildos and then a weird urinal that turns into a face mask.\n\nAnd in the comics, there's a great storyline where Hughie goes undercover disguised as a superhero. That was a story that Jack had always asked us to do. So part of it is, always be careful what you ask the writers for. Then we finally had this Webweaver character and the idea of Spider-Man going down to be kink tickled in the Batcave is just too good to pass up. I'm sorry, I just couldn't leave that on the table.\n\nWere there any pieces of that scene, either in writing or when you got to filming it, that Amazon said \"No, that's too far\"?\n\nNo, that was all pretty much as scripted. We had our poor writers' assistant do a long list of real kinks, because we were looking for some. And I remember reading down the list and I'm like, \"What's cake farting?\" And then they explained to me, and it's a real thing -- but don't look it up. I just said, that's incredible, we have to do that.\n\nAnd then it seemed like it was a real natural tie-in to bring Ashley into it, because she does have dom/sub tendencies. I love that it's just such a perfect setup that he doesn't know his own safe word. It's just like a beautiful comedy setup that he's trying to find it the whole time.\n\nWas the safe word always going to be \"Zendaya\" -- with the hint that Tek Knight says it's what Webweaver \"loves the most\" -- as a nod to Tom Holland's Spider-Man? Or did you work through any other potential safe word ideas?\n\nNo, it was Anslem Richardson, who is the brilliant writer of the episode -- he just put that in the first draft. I don't think we ever discussed it, and he just threw in that his safe word was \"Zendaya,\" and I just laughed my ass off about that.\n\nAfter going through all that, Hughie finally breaks down into tears with Annie at the end of the episode once they're back at headquarters. Will we see more fallout from that in the final episodes? Because he's been through a lot already with his dad's death, and then that sex-dungeon trauma happened.\n\nHis story in this particular episode is the kind of denial and compartmentalization a lot of us have when we're dealing with the death of a loved one. And if you look throughout the episode, he's always just saying, \"I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm totally fine. I'm fine.\" Which is what a lot of people do before you finally can sort of open the door to the pain you're feeling. And I think that's part of healing. So I think he's going to go on and really try to absorb and learn what his dad and his mother taught him about forgiveness, and really try to take that into the season. Because he really does have the most mature and human arc out of all the characters this season.\n\nWhere did the idea for Firecracker breastfeeding Homelander come from? We know his milk fetish, we know his mommy fetish. But the choice actually to take it to this level on screen and get Antony Starr and Valorie Curry comfortable with that...\n\nNo, of course, Ant and Val were like, \"Let's do it!\" I think I remember telling Val on Day 1 of seeing her in Toronto, \"Just so we're clear, Firecracker is going to be breastfeeding him.\" And I believe her response was something to the effect of like, \"Well, of course she is.\" When you take that character and how slavishly devoted she is to Homelander, and how she would do anything for him -- as she's made abundantly clear by saying it like seven times in a row to him -- that giving him the thing he wants most in the world becomes logical, in a bananas sort of way.\n\nAs we were saying in the room, because she's also jockeying to get in a better position as a way to sell out Sage, they're now competing for Homelander's attention. So the conversation in the room came up that Sage is great at what people might need intellectually, but Firecracker is really amazing at what people need emotionally. And we said, \"Well, what is the thing Homelander needs most in the world that no one else could give them?\" And it's a hop, skip and a jump to, \"Well, he would need a woman who's actually willing to let him breastfeed.\" And I remember distinctly, Ellie Monahan in the room said, \"If we're doing that, that's the craziest thing we've ever done.\" And it's close, man.\n\nThat scene, first of all, getting the milk squirted into his face, and Ant's shock and total delight is such a beautiful moment. But any other sane show would cut away at that point. And by the way, not that sane -- but that's when you cut away, you know what's gonna happen.\n\nThe fact that we cut to the actual breastfeeding scene makes me cover my mouth every time. It's just so stunning, and wow. Just what it means to the characters -- the actors' balls in pulling that off. I mean, it's just my chef's kiss to all of them.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is such an honor to have you here,\" Tek greets him.\n\nHomelander, however, has a less than complimentary response: \"Sage and I might need you for the moment, but let's get one thing straight: There's no team-up. We're not equals. You're pathetic. You can't even fly for God's sakes.\" (Is anyone else imagining Tai's voice from Clueless during that last part?)\n\nThe character of Tek Knight (portrayed by Derek Wilson) made his debut on the spinoff Gen V, where he used his superhuman deduction abilities to interrogate the Godolkin University students. Although Tek and two of those student supes, Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Sam (Asa Germann), appeared in last week's episode, showrunner Eric Kripke says there has been no discussion about making a Gen V character a more permanent part of The Boys, even with an available spot on The Seven.\n\n\"To me, that starts to become like such a crossover and so major to the story that it sort of states that people need to watch Gen V to understand who that character was. I want to try to avoid that, if I can, of making the watching of both shows start to feel like homework,\" Kripke explained to TVLine. \"If you want to watch Gen V, great! If you don't want to watch it, great.

This show, about a superhero group called The Seven, couldn't be further from the comic-book movies that dominate cinemas; the MCU wouldn't dream of being this transgressive. Shock factor is practically ingrained in the show's DNA -- whether it's extreme violence and gore, or the vicious lampooning of alt-right politics, the show, created by Eric Kripke, is never afraid to \"go there.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the show's plentiful sex scenes, outrageousness seems to be the show's mission statement. Let's not forget the infamous Season 3 premiere when one supe exploded inside another man's penis, killing him instantly. That seemed to set off a theme: There was even an exploding penis moment in the Boys spin-off series, Gen V. Heck, just a few episodes ago on The Boys, there was a moment that's best described as a rimming train in the vein of The Human Centipede. Its plethora of penetration is often gasp-worthy, but even the raunchiest sex in The Boys is brief. Or at least it was. In Episode 6, \"Dirty Business,\" The Boys tops itself (pun intended) with its longest and single most outrageous sex scene to date.\n\nThe scene takes place in the home of Tek Knight (Derek Wilson), an uber-wealthy supe who's invited leading politicians and The Seven to his home for a party. Hughie (Jack Quaid) and the Boys want in so they can figure out The Seven's secret plan. To infiltrate the party, Hughie has to assume the identity of Tek Knight's potential new sidekick Web Weaver, who conveniently has a super suit that covers his entire body, therefore hiding Hughie's identity.\n\nTek takes Hughie on a tour of his mansion, and when they're alone, he asks Hughie if he wants to see the Tek Cave. While I was expecting a high-tech secret base \u00e0 la the Bat Cave, with remarkable surveillance possibilities and world-class gadgetry, Tek's secret haven is actually a seedy sex dungeon. And I do mean seedy -- dildos, masks, ropes, and whips adorn the walls. There's a urinal that looks like it needed a deep clean two decades ago. Some things in the room would make even the kinkiest person blush, including a medieval torture device (a gibbet cage) and various other objects that defy description. There's even Tek's old sidekick, chained to the wall in a red gimp suit. And things only get weirder from there.\n\nThe next time the episode shows Tek's cave, Tek is self-asphyxiating off a chain hanging from the ceiling -- and while this is happening, he prompts Hughie to sit on a chocolate cake. Tek is delighted as Hughie hesitantly puts his bare ass on the cake. \"Smush it,\" he commands, which Hughie does. \"Now, fart,\" Tek orders. Hughie does, and a look of ecstasy flashes on Tek's face: \"That's fucking hot,\" he snarls.\n\nWhat's remarkable about this unhinged cornucopia of sexual fetish is that it never seeks to kink-shame, instead taking these sexual taboos at face value. It's funny, sure, but the laughs come from the sheer outlandishness of the scenario Hughie has found himself in, rather than the specific desires on display. Things are weird, but it's the weirdness, rather than people getting off on unexpected things, that's amusing. In the cake moment, laughter is almost a defense mechanism. It's not funny because Tek is turned on, but rather because Hughie is so uncomfortable that chuckling is the only way to make the scene palatable. It's worth noting too that Tek believes it's Web Weaver behind the mask, not Hughie. As far as he's concerned, Web Weaver is more than happy to play along with his sexual proclivities, in order to become his sidekick. The reality that it's actually Hughie, who is deeply opposed to participating in every second of the ordeal makes this more complicated and infinitely more queasy.\n\nIf the cake felt like too much, things ramp up into overdrive when Ashley (Colby Minifie), Vought CEO and close friend of Tek, enters the cave. It turns out their relationship runs way deeper than a mere friendship. To the dulcet tones of Chrisopher Cross' soft-rock \"Sailing,\" Hughie is chained on all fours on a leather chair, feet exposed. Ashley, now wearing a black latex dominatrix outfit, tickles Hughie's feet with a feather, threatening to piss all over his face.\n\nAshley clearly relishes the role of the dom, delivering unforgettable (and extremely graphic) lines like \"I'm gonna bite your dick off and cook it. I am 100 percent a cannibal\" and \"I'm going to feel your pink asshole around my wrist until you shit.\" It proves to be too much for Hughie, who begs for her to stop -- but he doesn't know Web Weaver's safe word so he continues concealing his identity as the antics wear on.\n\nThe sequence begins as amusing, but grows increasingly uncomfortable as Hughie becomes terrified over the situation he's in. It's clear Tek is truly balls-to-the-wall, and uses sex as a sort of weapon. There's no guarantee that Hughie will survive this interaction. The Boys is a show that viewers expect to feel uneasy while watching, but seeing Hughie earnestly beg and plead for the sexual escapades to stop while Ashley and Tek parade on, believing it's all part of a sexual fantasy they're all in on, is more extreme than the show has ever been.\n\nThe punchline of the scene comes as Ashley achieves orgasm while tickling Hughies feet, and goes over to make out with Tek in the throws of passion and debauchery.

But after that dungeon scene, I think we've all earned the right to kink-question.\n\nThe episode started off on a dark note, with Butcher torturing Samir while Kessler watched, trying to convince him to make more of the supe-killing virus they need to stop Homelander.\n\nPlus, Frenchie is still in prison, which is a bummer for everyone but especially Kimiko, who desperately misses her friend.\n\nRelated: Gen V Season 1 Ending Explained: How it Connects to The Boys Season 4\n\nGiven how broken and ashamed he was when he turned himself in at the end of The Boys Season 4 Episode 5, it's no surprise Frenchie isn't up for visitors.\n\nBut watching Kimiko be heartbroken isn't easy.\n\nFrenchie is the only person Kimiko really has a connection with, and with everything that's been going on, the two of them need each other.\n\nThe bulk of the episode takes place at billionaire Tek Knight's house.\n\nWe knew already from his earlier appearances on the show and its spinoff, Gen V, that Tek Knight (a.k.a. Robert Vernon) is pretty much the worst.\n\nBut this episode took us down a shady path.\n\nTek Knight's party, catering to the country's richest billionaires and featuring an appearance from the members of the Seven, turns out to be a classed-up KKK meeting, essentially.\n\nIt's not the first time (by a long shot) that we've heard racist vitriol spewed from the mouths of characters on The Boys.\n\nAlas, it's still a nightmare, and some of the quotes in the episode were essentially word-for-word replications of things said by actual American politicians. Horrifying.\n\nThe Boys' big plan is to infiltrate the party by dressing Hughie up in a stolen super suit.\n\nUnfortunately for him, that suit belongs to Webweaver, with whom Tek Knight and Ashley have a hole -- sorry, whole -- lot of big plans.\n\nHughie manages to place a few bugs around Tek Knight's house, but at what cost?\n\nRelated: The Boys Characters Who Deserve a Spotlight Episode\n\nThis is the part in the episode where we talk about where the line is and when it's crossed.\n\nFrom an objective perspective, Hughie was repeatedly (and gruesomely) sexually assaulted.\n\nIs that just a hazard of the job? He didn't seem particularly traumatized afterward, but how is that possible?\n\nAt the very least, Hughie deserves a raise. (Do The Boys get paid?)\n\nI also don't think I'll ever be able to look at a cake the same way again.\n\nThe toll Compound V has taken on him is hard to ignore, and his hallucinations of Becca get harder and harder to watch each episode.\n\nBut he's determined to get this virus and finish what he started, regardless of who might get hurt in the process.\n\nShoutout to Jeffrey Dean Morgan for his impeccable acting, as always.\n\nAside from the absolutely massive reveal at the end of the episode (we'll get to that, don't worry), we're reminded that JDM is the absolute king of monologues.\n\nBut his performance on The Boys has given us back a smidge of his unsettling and terrifying character, Negan, from The Walking Dead.\n\nSomething has felt off all season long, and many of you eagle-eyed fans caught it long ago, too.\n\nThat's right, folks. Kessler doesn't actually exist!\n\nCall me a victim of Victoria Neumann, because my mind is BLOWN.\n\n\"Dirty Business\" dropped the bomb that all along, Kessler has been a figment of Butcher's imagination, just like Becca.\n\nThere were those of you who saw this coming after noticing that no one other than Butcher had actually spoken to Kessler all season, and his cup remained untouched in his first appearance during the season premiere.\n\nYou got a big old fat V'd up brain tumor, you cunt, which is why you're seeing me in the first place.\n\nHowever, nothing was confirmed until we saw Kessler turn to Becca and tell her to shut up, proving that everything we were seeing was happening inside Butcher's head.\n\nThe most sinister reveal of the episode, however, was that the powers that be in the country have plans to build and use internment camps.\n\nThe news was as terrifying as it was unsurprising.\n\nWhether Butcher's plan to use the virus (which Samir has reminded him will kill anyone with Compound V in their bloodstream) will work remains to be seen.\n\nRelated: Jared Padalecki Reveals Plans to Join Cast of The Boys\n\nBut it's clear that someone is going to have to do something, and soon, if they're going to prevent some very severe war crimes.\n\nAnd speaking of horrible things no one wants to see, how wonderful is it that Firecracker took it upon herself to induce lactation so she could breastfeed Homelander?\n\nWe've all been missing that since Stillwell was killed off in The Boys Season 1 Episode 8. (That's sarcasm.)\n\nAnyway.\n\nBefore we go: does anyone think Zendaya watches this show, and if so, I wonder how she feels about her name being Webweaver's safe word?\n\nWith only two episodes left in Season 4, it seems impossible that the writers have managed to wrap everything up in time for the finale.\n\nThat said, we can probably expect some intense and action-packed hours ahead of us as we round out the season.\n\nIn the meantime, let us know in the comments how you feel about the season so far. Who are your favorite new characters? Are the writers taking things too far?", "source": {"uri": "tvfanatic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Fanatic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "haley_whitmire_white@tvfanatic.com", "name": "Haley Whitmire White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centipede (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John von Neumann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Padalecki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Padalecki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarcasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walking Dead (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://tv-fanatic-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--khbsJYls--/t_full/cs_srgb,d_tv-fanatic-placeholder-square.png,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1720039904/firecracker-is-just-happy-to-be-here-the-boys-s04e06-dirty-busin.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

As always, \"The Boys\" Season 4 has a lot going on and we're here to break it all down.\n\nIn Episode 6, titled \"Dirty Business,\" The Boys embark on a journey into Tek Knight's estate, where The Seven members Sage (Susan Heyward), Firecracker (Valorie Curry), A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) and Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) gathered the top one percent of the country to discuss their ploy to replace Robert Singer with Victoria as president, once he's elected into office.\n\nOn top of that, Noir (Nathan Mitchell) finally unveils himself, fans learn there's no other way to kill Homelander unless all supes are killed, Frenchie won't allow anyone to visit him in prison and Hughie (Jack Quaid) is still grappling with his father Hugh's (Simon Pegg) death.\n\nThat's just a portion of everything that went down in Episode 6. Here are the most shocking moments from the episode.\n\nIn order to find out what Homelander and co. are up to at Tek Knight's federalist society party, Mother's Milk devised a plan for Hughie to go undercover as Webweaver, a supe with Spider-Man-like abilities, though his webs shoot out from his bottom, like an actual spider's does. Anyway, after tricking Webweaver out of his suit, Hughie's job was to plant listening devices throughout Tek's tavern.\n\nHowever, while The Boys knew Webweaver was a close connection of Tek's, they didn't know the two were sex buddies on the low, and that Webweaver was attending the party so he could participate in Tek's \"sidekick\" audition process that involves torture, bodily fluids, whips and chains.\n\n\"I'm going to sit my swollen clit on your stupid masked face and piss like a skunk. And I just had asparagus. You want that?\" Tek's partner and Vought exec Ashley Barrett asks a pinned down, disguised Hughie.\n\nHughie pulled through the ordeal, but what gave him away was his inability to call out Webweaver's BDSM safe word, \"Zendaya.\" Once his cover was blown, Tek decided he'd cut holes into Hughie's body and \"f -- k them.\" Thankfully, just as Tek was about to slice into Hughie, Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and Starlight/Annie (Erin Moriarty) burst into the room and freed Hughie.\n\nTek's demise was left to Thomas, his butler and former guardian, who strangled him to death after Tek admitted that he wanted to help Homelander make prison camps.\n\n\"They need places across the country to put their dissidence. Look, I don't know anything else!\" Tek told the Boys before his death.\n\nAnd before they left, Kimiko transferred millions of Tek's money (which he inherited from his family's former slave catching business and now private prison operation).\n\nVictoria has her hands in a lot of pots: she temporarily teamed up with the Boys to locate more of the supe-killing virus, she wants to take down Homelander and she's also running for Vice President of the United States for Robert Singer, under Homelander's orders. But now, fans have found out that she's also partnering with Homelander and co. against Robert to help position herself as the next president instead. During Tek's \"alt-right cocktail party\" with the billionaires of the country, Victoria pleaded her case for why they should trust her.\n\n\"I'm here tonight to tell the truth: truth is America's not a democracy. The word democracy makes people feel safe,\" Victoria began. \"But the founders never trusted the masses because the truth is the masses are f -- g stupid. Anyone who has a 'live, laugh, love' mug shouldn't have a say in how a country is run. People are a labor force that need a kind and firm hand. There are no nations. There's Apple, Exxon and Birkshire Hathaway. Corporations are the real super powers here. You should be able to operate without any regulation or restriction whatsoever. After all, you're billionaires. You're smart enough to know what's best. Bottom line: you support me and that is what you'll f -- g get.\"\n\nHer statements were applauded by the top one-percenters, signaling that it won't take long for Homelander's larger plot, to have the country ran by supes, to be fully manifested.\n\nSeason 4 has been a big moment for A-Train's story: he's still trying to win back over his family after failing to stand up against Blue Hawk's (Nick Wechsler) brutality in Season 3, teamed up to help the Boys and redeem his integrity, all while navigating the blatant and microaggressive racism he deals with as a member of The Seven. Luckily, he seems to have developed a bond with Mother's Milk, who physically has been overwhelmed by The Boys' plans as well as his own family matters.\n\nDuring The Boys' break-in into Tek's home, they run into Sage (Susan Heyward), who starts playing mind games with Mother's Milk, mocking him over his daughter's troubles at school.\n\n\"If you kill me you'd have to look Janine in the eye. Doesn't she have enough problems? Expelled, told a boy to eat a bag of d -- s and then broke his arm. I bet she gets that from you, chip off the old block. She has anger issues, signs of OCD. You see that. You've cursed the girl,\" Sage says to Mother's Milk just before making an attempt to call for help.\n\nThat's when Mother's Milk shot her in the head.\n\nThe entire interaction drove Mother's Milk into a panic attack. And who came in to save him? A-Train. Well, at first he didn't want to, but after Kimiko begged him for the sake of Mother's Milk's daughter, A-Train accepted the task and dropped him off at the nearest hospital. Before returning to the party, a young boy at the hospital recognized A-Train and the good deed he was doing, which brought a heartwarming smile to A-Train's face. For the first time in a while, A-Train felt what being a hero is actually like.\n\nIf it wasn't clear that Firecracker is obsessed with Homelander, it sure as hell is now. Firecracker has volunteered to take the reins from now-murdered Vought International exec Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue) and become Homelander's new breastfeeder. In Season 1, fans learned about Homelander's childhood trauma and how it manifested into a breastmilk addiction. In the second to last scene from Episode 6, Firecracker gives her body to Homelander despite his lack of attraction to her, stating that the arrangement is only about \"loyalty\" between the two.\n\n\"You brought me in. God, you have given me everything. You are everything to me,\" Firecracker says just before unzipping her suit, giving the impression that she's about to make a move on Homelander. But actually, she just wants to show him that she's taken an unprescribed amount of drugs that enable her to produce breastmilk, though it's gradually enlarging her heart.\n\n\"What are you doing? I am not sexually attracted to you.\" Homelander says to Firecracker.\n\n\"This ain't about sex,\" she replies. \"No, this, it's about loyalty.\" She then squirts his face with breastmilk.\n\n\"You're not pregnant,\" he states in shock.\n\n\"There's a long regimen of drugs a person can take to make it happen -- enlarges the heart just a tiny, little bit,\" she says.\n\n\"You did this for me?\" Homelander asks.\n\n\"I'd do anything for you,\" Firecracker. The scene then cuts to Firecracker cradling and breastfeeding Homelander in front of an American flag.\n\n\"That's my good, little boy,\" Firecracker says to Homelander.\n\nMaybe, the southern belle supe -- who has long been labeled worthless or insignificant in her past -- just wants to feel like she's of value to someone. But we'll see how long this last since Homelander didn't go easy on Madelyn.\n\nFans don't get to see much of Butcher in Episode 6 and that's because he's tucked away with Butcher and Joe in a barn trying to force Victoria's one-legged baby daddy Sameer (Omid Abtahi) to create more of the supe-killing virus. After Sameer tells Butcher that the only to kill Homelander would be to craft a virus serum that would ultimately take out anyone with Compund V running through their veins (meaning Ryan, Kimiko and Annie), Butcher begins contemplating his options with help from Joe and his hallucination of his wife Rebecca (Shantel VanSanten).\n\n\"We can wipe them all out,\" Joe says to Butcher.\n\n\"Billy, you cannot go along with this,\" Rebecca chimes in.\n\n\"Listen, mate. No one ever said nothing about genocide,\" Butcher says.\n\n\"Who was it that said they all gotta go? Every f -- g last one of 'em,\" Joe says.\n\n\"He's talking about murder, Billy, of thousands,\" Rebecca says, trying to reason with Butcher. \"And a lot of them are innocent. Ok, I know you.\"\n\n\"Shut your f -- g cake hole, b -- h!\" Joe yells at Rebecca, showing that Joe is not only aware that Rebecca is a hallucination, but that he's one as well.\n\nThis whole time Butcher has been talking to the ghost of Joe, who is dead. Butcher then hollers in denial that he believes the hallucination of Joe is real.\n\n\"Unless of course, you got a big ole fat V'd up brain tumor, ya c -- t, which is why you are seeing me in the first place,\" Joe says. \"I am inside of you.

Derek Wilson's billionaire vigilante Tek Knight, whose cinematic legacy played into the show's MCU Phase schedule parody, is both the source material and TV show's hyper-perverted take on Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he certainly got his time to shine in the episode \"Dirty Business,\" which took viewers into his nasty-ass Tek-Cave.\n\nBut the episode didn't just play up on Bruce Wayne's orphanized origin story, and also featured perhaps the grossest Spider-Man pastiche possible, which somehow didn't even occur to me until that storyline's big \"reveal.\" And that's not even talking about Butcher's story going all mega-TV twist on everybody like if Jeffrey Dean Morgan was Fight Club's Tyler Durden. But let's talk about the best detail from each of the comic superhero-riffing stories for Tek Knight and the Web Weaver.\n\nWhile part of me wishes The Boys' sixth Season 4 episode would have been more of a direct one-to-one spoof of a Batman story, that's just not how this show fuctions. So instead of a series of steady Naked Gun-esque type gags, the show went straight for the jugular (or whatever applicable vein) by revealing Tek Knight to be a fetish-embracing pervert on top of being a sense-enhanced Supe.\n\nAs if the character's personality weren't already a major red flag, the fact that the Tek-Cave is avaiilable to access through pulling the Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom was possibly as big a calling card as just changing his name to BDSM Man. And there wasn't anything too comforting about knowing that Tek Knight's murdered parents were cogs within a familial machine of racism, and that he was brazenly open about his bigotry in front of his Black wait staff.\n\nIn fact, that's how The Boys pulls off perhaps its most shocking Batman-twisting moment near the end of the episode: death by beloved butler. When Tek finally reveals his big part in Vought and Homelander's new plan involves using his family owned prisons as internment camps to house Supe-protesting citizens. At that point, as the protagonists were coming to terms with that monstrousness, the billionaire's Alfred-esque butler Elijah (Tyrone Benskin) popped up and vengefully murdered his employer for years and years of workplace abuse and truly sordid housecleaning duties.\n\nRegardless of what Batman-related story one is reading, one of the least likely scenarios that could ever play out would be Alfred Pennyworth brutally taking out Bruce Wayne, a man he'd raised since the traumas of his youth. Alfred was always a parental authority figure, even when Bruce was a catty little bastard, but never wavered from his Wayne family promise. I can't imagine how things would have gone in the Batcave had Alfred ever dealth with the toxicity that Elijah did, and thankfully won't ever have to. (It is kinda fun to imagine this scene being Michael Caine's audition scene for Batman Begins.)\n\nNo R.I.P. for ol' Tek Knight here. He may rest in Ashley's pee, though.\n\nOne of the more disturbingly simple superhero send-ups on The Boys, Web Weaver is introduced as a bit of a junkie who apparently shares a lot of the same sexual hang-ups as Tek Knight, Ashley and presumably others within the Vought Empire. But instead of utilizing a pair of wrist-based web shooters to make his silky creations, Dan Mousseau's character produces his from a funky looking orifice located around his tailbone.\n\nBecause the quasi-arachnid Supe was knocked out early on, with Hughie donning his stank-ass costume to infiltrate Tek Knight's party, viewers don't really get a whole lot of Web Weaver-specific lore to dig into. The exception being, of course, the elusive safe word that Hughie attempted to guess a few times in order to avoid having his feet tickled incessantly, among other things.\n\nThe existence of the safe word is introduced rather quickly, with the only clue being that it's the thing that Web Weaver loves the most. I was ready to believe that the entire joke there was just that Hughie would frustratingly never land on the correct answer. But after Starlight and Kimiko rescue Hughie and are taking him back up the elevator, Elijah makes the big reveal: Web Weaver's safe word was \"Zendaya.\"\n\nSure, having \"Zendaya\" as a safe word could mean that Web Weaver's Gen-Z persona was really into HBO's Euphoria, but it seems clear that she was namechecked as a direct nod to her presence as M.J. in Tom Holland's Spider-Man movies. Does that mean Spider-Man: Far From Home exists in this universe? Let's go with \"yes,\" and leave the onus of proof on those who want to say otherwise.\n\nWill fans see Web Weaver or his costume again in the world of The Boys? Only time will tell, so be sure to tune into the final two episodes of Season 4 when they drop on Prime Video over the next two Thursdays.

It lifts our spirits after the downer that was last week's teary-eyed conclusion, and even drops its own bombshell of a parting reveal (that you probably saw coming if you've been paying close attention). Unshackled from the multiple storytelling angles still stuck in place after a multi-week lull, The Boys finally feels like its rambunctious self again.\n\nThe gravely voiced elephant in the room is finally confirmed: Joe Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is an illness-induced hallucination like Becca (Shantel VanSanten). There had been clues sprinkled throughout past episodes, but nothing concrete until now. Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) isn't around much in \"Dirty Business,\" only there long enough to establish his dual imaginary friends -- a now one-legged Dr. Sameer Shah (Omid Abtahi) earns the honor of calling out Butcher's delirious state, complete with a quick montage of Butcher talking to empty rooms in past scenes where we thought Kessler was present. It's not a groundbreaking twist, yet having Kessler and Sameer react to Butcher's whacked-out state helps the shock value last longer.\n\nElsewhere, and for the lion's share of the episode's duration, we spend an evening in Tek Knight's (Derek Wilson) Bruce Wayne-like mansion -- only his Batcave is a Fifty Shades hideout. An invitation-only, highfalutin affair brings The Seven's A-list players together with United States government officials, complete with all the self-serving corruption we crave. The gathering's purpose is to collude and discuss an antinode to Robert Singer's (Jim Beaver) presidency, which means The Boys have no choice but to send Hughie (Jack Quaid) undercover as The Boys' Spider-Man equivalent, a junkie named Webweaver (Dan Mousseau). Quaid plays tactically awkward and out-of-depths, which he's already done so well throughout The Boys, until Hughie finds himself restrained, learning the hard way that Webweaver was only invited as a pass-around pleasure boy.\n\nSticking innocent Hughie in a secret room with a horned-up Tek Knight and Ashely Barrett (Colby Minifie) is a recipe for comedy gold. It starts simply, with Hughie trying to imitate Webweaver's drugged-up stoner speak -- then panic sets in when he notices Homelander (Antony Starr) at the party. Tek Knight later leads Hughie downstairs into his pervert lair, where Ashley gets the first crack at tickling \"Webweaver\" and herself until she climaxes. Hughie's mortified despite laughing through the sticky-stanky ordeal, which Quaid sells with appropriate undertones of excitable panic -- but Colby Minifie is the secret sauce. The way she forcefully delivers vulgar lines as a sexually dominant alpha exhibits volcanic confidence, as Ashley beams her devilish smirk while degrading her partners in fetishistic displays of ball-crushing power.\n\nWhen Hughie's outed by Tek Knight for forgetting Webweaver's safe word, The Boys rush to his aid - but it's hardly a clean escape. Annie (Erin Moriarty) confronts Firecracker (Valorie Curry) in an upstairs hallway, where she rightfully apologizes for being a proper monster in her pageant days before incapacitating Vought's racist, antisemitic mouthpiece. Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) suffers a panic attack after shooting Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) in the head, as he succumbs to pressures that never cracked Butcher. Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and Annie eventually reach Hughie right before Tek Knight carves a new hole in his body to penetrate, and they turn the tables on the fornicating freak, but not until after what's left of The Boys make noteworthy character strides. Annie's confession, MM's health scare, and Hughie's ability to admit he's far from okay are all concisely packed into the main storyline. That's a massive upgrade from prior Season 4 episodes that feel torn in fifty different directions.\n\nA narrower scope lets performances shine, like how Sister Sage and Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) steal \"Dirty Business\" toward the end. Sister Sage spends most of the episode playing mind games with her Vought-controlled pawns until MM's bullet turns her into the Bloomin' Onion craving Sister Sage at a hilarious moment. She can't help Homelander win a crowd of constituents over with his supe supremacy plan, so Victoria steals Homelander's thunder and brings his monologue home with bravado. Homelander, the tyrannical superhuman who keeps insisting humans are toys, shrinks to the size of a pea when he fails to grin his way to success. Worse, his masculine aura is shattered by Victoria's actions and Sister Sage's inability to prop him upright. Homelander crumbles under pressure like a Nature Valley granola bar, acknowledging his inability to be Vought's sole dictator.\n\n\"Dirty Business\" resuscitates The Boys' satirical wits and bleak comedy beyond Hughie's psycho-sexual episode. Victoria despises hobnobbing with wrinkly conservative ghouls to the point where she imagines violently popping her own head as some Roe v. Wade opposing official can be heard explaining inaccurate abortion facts. A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) has to listen to Tek Knight's despicably bigoted story about his family's lucrative legacy as slave catchers, remarking how he'd have given his great-great-grandaddy a run for his money -- A-Train's reaction is priceless. Self-proclaimed guardians Like Tek Knight say the quiet parts into a megaphone, and \"Dirty Business\" follows villainy with just deserts. After Tek Knight is reprimanded by Annie and Kimiko, they donate hundreds of millions from his bank accounts to charitable funds for Black Lives Matter or Elizabeth Warren's Super PAC as he protests in agony. He won't admit pain when participating in the most depraved carnal pleasures, but send his filthy inheritance to worthy causes? His Muskian intolerance throws a tantrum.\n\nBest of all, Tek Knight's death leaves The Seven in disarray. The Boys may be in shambles, especially with Frenchie (Tomer Capone) in prison, but their unintended actions are a clever dagger. Homelander realizes the mole is still alive -- it was never Ashley's sacrificial lamb Cameron Coleman (Matthew Edison) -- and he's one step closer to the edge (and he's about to break). Enter Firecracker, who squirts him with medically-possible lactation as the ultimate olive branch. Cut to Homelander, draped in his cape, suckling on Firecracker's teat, both sitting in front of a massive American flag tapestry. It's one of my favorite shots in The Boys, as America's greatest patriot is a man-baby behind closed doors who's still breastfeeding. This is the show that I know and love; what too much of Season 4 has been missing until now.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hughie (Jack Quaid) goes undercover as Supe Webweaver, except things quickly go downhill in unexpected ways.\n\nViewers were at a loss for words by the events of the episode, but before we reveal all be warned that this article contains spoilers for Episode 6.\n\nWhen Hughie goes undercover at Tek Knight's home he is forced to go along with things when the Supe starts talking about an agreement they have made. Unbeknownst to Hughie, the agreement is not a normal superhero team up it's an agreement of a sexual nature.\n\nHughie realises this too late, when he is brought to Tek Knight's secret lair and is promptly strapped down while the Supe and Ashley (Colby Minifie) gratify themselves while assaulting him.\n\nHughie tries to urge his fellow Boys to come and help him, but communication has been cut off between them. It is only thanks to Starlight (Erin Moriarty), Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) heading in because they sense something is off that he is able to be set free.\n\nThis outlandish sequence of events is added to by an interaction between Homelander and Firecracker, who reveals to him that she's taken drugs that makes her able to breastfeed and offers to do so for the milk-loving Supe. He accepts, and viewers then promptly see the act take place.\n\nFeeling similarly, another person wrote: \"I felt so f***ing bad for Hughie this episode and last episode...my guy just can't catch a break\"\n\nThe episode may have been full of gruesome, explicit content, but there was also one heart-warming moment that delighted viewers.\n\nA-Train (Jessie T Usher) has been slowly realising the error of his fellow Supes, and has been becoming increasingly helpful to The Boys in their goals. Episode 6 saw the character finally feel what it means to be a hero though, because he saved Mother's Milk by rushing him to a hospital only for a young child to see him do it.\n\nFor a moment A-Train and the boy look at each other, wonder in the child's eyes as the Supe smiles and, clearly, feels moved by finally feeling like he is being seen as a hero.\n\nSome viewers picked up on this, with one writing: \"no cause that's probably the first time a-train really felt like a hero\", while another wrote: \"It was in this exact moment where A-Train felt like a true hero. His redemption arc is coming.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supe_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Minifie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colby Minifie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Fukuhara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Fukuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laz_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laz Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NhttEOakq0SyD3QLLXBpmA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/e80dce30-39fe-11ef-baff-12ffce9c5d18", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Plus, The Seven's latest addition Firecracker (Valorie Curry) takes it upon herself to follow a regimen of drugs to become Homelander's (Antony Starr) new milk supplier in a scene showrunner Eric Kripke admits is \"the craziest thing we've ever done.\"\n\nBelow, Kripke, Curry, and Minifie weigh in on the latest developments and tease what's next.\n\nThe Joe Kessler Reveal\n\nPrime Video\n\nIt turns out that the Joe Kessler fans have come to know onscreen in Season 4 isn't the real Joe Kessler, but merely the one in Butcher's mind as the vigilante finally makes the connection that his friend never interacts with anyone but him... until he speaks directly to Butcher's vision of his dead wife Becca (Shantel VanSanten).\n\nThe twist is something that some fans have theorized for a while, and Kripke admits, \"I have noticed that some of the fans have predicted it much to my chagrin, but I don't know, maybe there's just too much knowledge about Fight Club.\" For fans who didn't see it coming, there was plenty that Kripke and his team did to keep viewers in the dark. \"We tried to be really tight with the rules. He's not talking to other people. He's not really lifting things. We tried to layer all that in,\" Kripke adds of Kessler's true nature being shrouded in mystery.\n\nWhen Kripke first introduced the idea to his former Supernatural collaborator, he says, \"I think the reveal was the thing that [Jeffrey Dean Morgan] was most excited about because, before the twist, he's an interesting but pretty straightforward CIA guy. And I think Jeffrey was jazzed by the idea that 'Oh, he's actually this walking nightmare who then moving forward can be a really interesting devil on [Butcher's] shoulder and a really interesting character that can just keep twisting the knife over and over again.\"\n\nAnd, as mentioned, above, if Kessler is the devil on Butcher's shoulder, Kripke told TV Insider earlier this season that \"Becca is the angel on [Butcher's] shoulder and she represents everything that's good about him.\" Which means that Kessler's as bad as they get. As fans may recall, he was the one swaying Butcher to poison Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) with cookies.\n\nAs for whether Kessler is a vision caused by the cancerous tumor growing in Butcher's brain or is instead a side-effect of the Compound-V Butcher injected into himself as a potential cure, Kripke says, \"I just think it's cancer and the dark side of Butcher that have all metastasized into the same thing. In our minds, all of his hate and anger have fed this side of him. So for us, it's more about his duality of who is the human part of him by Becca and what part of him is a monster that's represented by Kessler, but they're all Butcher, he clarifies.\n\nFirecracker Breastfeeds Homelander & His Mommy Issues\n\nPrime Video\n\nBut Kessler's true nature wasn't the most bonkers aspect of the episode. That honor goes to Firecracker's offer to be Homelander's exclusive provider of breastmilk. Cornering the Supe in his apartment, Firecracker shocks him by releasing the med-induced liquids onto his shocked face, leading to the most bizarre breastfeeding setup.\n\nFor anyone who has kept track of the series, The Boys has consistently tracked Homelander's mommy issues, and Kripke admits, \"I don't know what further thing there is to do with mommy issues [apart from Homelander] literally climbing into someone's womb.... that's actually kind of a good idea. Maybe we'll do that next season,\" Kripke muses as he ponders the idea.\n\n\"But yeah, he's got a breastmilk obsession, and it's very logical in its own crazy way that someone who only wants to be slavishly devoted to Homelander would give him the forbidden thing he wants most in the world.\" When it came to putting the scene together, Kripke admits that when was watching it back, his initial reaction was, \"That's just the craziest thing I think I've ever seen. It's that moment, it's him breastfeeding. I can't watch it without covering my face. It's so bananas.\"\n\n\"It seems so inevitable,\" Curry notes of Homelander and Firecracker's next step. \"Of course, that happens.\" For the new star of the series, Curry says, \"I noticed, what I find ironic about Firecracker, about that scene and that being her emotional access point, is that for someone who is so superficially sexualized, [she] defies and fits into this hypersexual feminine mold, actually her explicit scene isn't sexual at all. It's quite pointedly not sexual. And I think that's great. I loved that we both came to the scene wanting it to be really vulnerable. And she has a fearlessness with him because she knows she's touching on exactly the right nerve.\"\n\nWhat excited Curry the most about the sequence is that it \"subverts the expectation about how Firecracker is going to elbow her way in.\" With her newfound purpose on The Seven as Homelander's main source of milk, we're sure there are dynamic changes ahead.\n\nTek Knight & Ashley's Sex Dungeon Journey\n\nPrime Video\n\nIn one of the episode's sillier adventures, a disguised Hughie finds himself trapped in Tek Knight's sex dungeon being run by a domineering Ashley. The raunchy storyline was something Minifie was eager to tackle. \"When I first got this job, I always wondered what she does on her time off or what's going on with her at home behind the scenes, and we've gotten to explore a little bit more of that this year. And it's ever so exciting that this is what she's doing,\" Minifie notes.\n\n\"There's something very freeing about the dominatrix side of things,\" Minifie continues. \"Like if you know where the line is, the line that you can't cross, it's actually quite freeing to dance up to that edge, and that is something that Ashley doesn't have in the rest of her work life.\" Ultimately, Ashley is unaware that the subject of her domineering is actually Hughie, believing he is Webweaver (Dan Mousseau).\n\nWhen Tek Knight uncovers this, he threatens to mutilate Hughie, but the tables are turned when other members of The Boys attempt to save Hughie. In the end, Tek Knight, who was introduced in Gen V Season 1 didn't make it out of his sex dungeon as the butler who raised him, Elijah (Tyrone Benskin) choked him to death, allowing Hughie and the other Boys to escape.\n\nRelated\n\n'The Boys' Boss on Hughie's Goodbye, 'Gen V' Crossover & Those Supe Animals\n\n\"At this moment at least they're keeping Tek Knight's death kind of on the down low,\" Kripke says of the eventful demise. \"But he's so awful. He just deserves a unique spot in hell. And we were just so taken with the idea that you are a wealthy orphan-turned-vigilante who has a butler take care of you. And the Butler is finally so sick of your s**t that he murders you. Such a delightful play on a real famous superhero that we just couldn't avoid it,\" Kripke notes, seemingly referencing Batman.\n\nWhat will happen next?

Don't worry, her victory will probably be brief because Homelander is a fickle beast, and at any given time, plenty of other Supes (other than A-Train, who is over it) and humans would turn themselves inside out for the mega villain. He has options, although surely, his time will eventually run out, too.\n\nThe answer to that question: she will go as low as possible and perhaps even die in the process. In Firecracker's eyes, however, she's made an incredible amount of progress with Homelander, which of course, is a satiric take on the cheerleading, gun-toting certain MAGA congress-types who profess their undying loyalty no matter what their leader does. Firecracker is, honest to god, now voluntarily lactating to fulfill Homelander's milk fetish, and she only had to risk her health (by taking a regimen of drugs that \"enlarges the heart just a tiny little bit\") to get there. Suddenly, the far-right nightmare is Homelander's favorite member of the Seven, even above Sister Sage.\n\nThis gave the audience the very bizarre visual of seeing Homelander splashed in the face with breast milk, followed by his surprise and absolute pleasure. Then things got weirder with him lounging on a couch as she nursed him. Yup, The Boys does not disappoint when it comes to spectacle, but if Firecracker thinks that this will win Homie's favor forever, she's clearly deluded. That's especially the case because I have a hunch that Cate will eventually be a part of The Seven, and nobody kisses Homelander's tush with as much convincing fervor as the female Gen V recruit. Again, I feel like Sam is simply going along with the ride because it's a less excruciating experience than Godolkin University gave him, but Cate has 110% drunk the Homelander Kool-Aid.\n\nIn other words, enjoy this moment, Firecracker. Despite the extreme show of allegiance and devotion, you'll explode or fizzle out due to Homelander's voluntary lack of object permanence and -- let's face it -- psychopathy.\n\nWhere to start? He's been endlessly traumatized since the opening moments of the series, and Hughie lost his dad last week. There's no time to mourn, however, because this week, he has to spend the majority of his onscreen time in Tek Knight's dungeon. There, Hughie experiences Ashley's pee-soaked form of domination before Tek Knight's obsession with holes almost ends Hughie's life. There was a nice little moment when Starlight and Kimiko came to the rescue and wired Tek Knight's money to Black Lives Matter, which turned out to be the ultimate torture for him.\n\nAfter the dust settled, Hughie revealed that he is very much \"not fine\" (dude had a family tragedy, and then he was directed by Tek Knight to take off his pants and fart into a chocolate cake, so yes, therapy could be useful), and he could really use a time out one of these days. That day is not today. Or tomorrow. Or anytime in the next few weeks.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kimberly_riccifilm@uproxx.com", "name": "Kimberly RicciFilm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fetishism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual fetishism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Object permanence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flatulence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kool-Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BDSM"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/the_boys_recap710x400.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Showrunner Eric Kripke discusses the emotional underpinnings of the episode, the challenges of wearing a latex costume, and the evolution of Homelander and Firecracker's relationship. Kripke reveals the process behind the reveal of who Kessler really is, and the thought process behind some of the show's more bizarre moments.\n\nIn episode six of Season 4 of the Prime Video series The Boys, Homelander (Antony Starr), Sage (Susan Heyward) and Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) attend a party at Tek Knight's expansive manor to further their plan to help Neuman become President. At the same time, Hughie (Jack Quaid) disguises himself as Web Weaver and unexpectedly finds himself in the secret underground Tek Cave without the proper safe word. Elsewhere, Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) continues to push Butcher (Karl Urban) to do whatever he can to get more of the virus needed to kill Homelander, but Homelander is back at Vought getting to know Firecracker (Valorie Curry) in a whole new way.\n\nDuring this one-on-one interview with Collider, showrunner Eric Kripke broke down all the blood, latex and breast milk of episode six, entitled \"Dirty Business.\" He talked about how Hughie came to put on the Web Weaver suit, whether Quaid was actually the one in the costume the entire time, ensuring their latex-wearing character took the proper breaks to let his skin breathe, how the chosen safe word came about, the evolution of the Homelander and Firecracker relationship, the scene he felt was the craziest they've done, and how that Kessler reveal came about.\n\nThe Boys\n\nTV-MA\n\nSuperhero\n\nAction\n\nSci-Fi\n\nDrama\n\nCrime\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019\n\nCreator Eric Kripke\n\nCast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash\n\nSeasons 4\n\nStudio Amazon Studios\n\nCollider: After everything that he went through with his father, what was the thought process that went into making Jack Quaid follow that up with dressing up as Web Weaver and having to sit his naked ass on a cake?\n\nERIC KRIPKE: You say that like it's a bad thing. The emotional arc for Hughie, in this particular episode, is like so many people after the death of a loved one. They tend to compartmentalize and throw themselves into work and say everything's fine, but it's not fine. He needs to give himself time and space. A lot of people tend to throw themselves a little in over their heads with work that they're not prepared to handle, so there really was talk of a real emotional underpinning to what he was going through. There was always a story from the comics of Hughie going undercover as a superhero to infiltrate, and Jack always asked me to do that story, but you wanna be very, very careful of what you ask the writers for. It all just came together. We basically had Wayne manor, and we were able to bring Spider-Man into Batman's mansion and take him down into the bat cave that was really a sex dungeon. I just don't know how you pass that up.\n\nJack Quaid's Revealing Turn As Web Weaver Was All Him Under the Mask\n\nDid you actually fully torture him and make him do all of that, or was he able to have someone else under the mask?\n\nKRIPKE: That is all credit to Jack and his dedication. That is Jack in that suit, the whole fucking time. At no point, did it even occur to Jack to say, \"You know, none of this has to be me. I could just voice it later.\" Jack wanted it to be his real reaction, so that is Jack under the mask, literally the entire time.\n\nHow did he feel about having to wear the device in his mouth?\n\nKRIPKE: You'd have to ask him. I don't know. I do know that with the Laddio character, because he's almost entirely covered in latex, I learned that you do actually have to take breaks to let his skin breathe, because it's actually dangerous to keep all parts of your skin covered. Your skin actually needs to breathe, also. So, I learned a little about latex play. I'd think that the suit would be really claustrophobic and wearing a mask for so long would be hard, and I remember hearing that that wasn't easy for him, but you'd have to ask him. I wasn't there. Maybe he was just happy that he could breathe through his nose with the mask off.\n\nRelated\n\nThe 6 Things You Need To Know Before Watching 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 6\n\nYou are cordially invited to the Tek Cave.\n\nWho picked \"Zendaya\" as the safe word?\n\nKRIPKE: That was Slem (Anslem Richardson), the episode's brilliant writer. I think he just threw it into the first draft, and I just started laughing my ass off. And then, we kept it. I kept waiting for Sony to say, \"No fucking way,\" but they never did.\n\nHomelander and Firecracker Have Taken Their Relationship to a Very Different Level\n\nClose\n\nWere there a lot of conversations about how to best have the whole breast milk situation with Homelander and Firecracker to play out? When I spoke to Antony Starr about that, he told me that was the weirdest thing he's ever done on this show, even with all the other weird things. How did all of that evolve, from getting squirted in the face to laying on the couch?\n\nKRIPKE: It was totally insane. We were talking about how, at this point in the story, Firecracker really wants to jockey past Sage into Homelander's good graces and take first position. And she's really, really good at reading people's emotional needs. And so, when you're in the writers' room and you start thinking, \"What is it that Homelander wants most in the world, but is afraid to ask or can't get?,\" it doesn't take that much conversation before you get to, \"He's just dying for someone to let him breastfeed.\" We were like, \"That's absolutely insane, and we definitely have to do that.\" Ant and Val [Curry] were totally game. They really got it. They understood.\n\nAs you always do when there's simulated nudity, we always get very, very specific about what our shots are, and both actors sign off on every shot and every angle, to make sure that it's something that they're comfortable with. We rehearse it. Running a safe space is first and foremost, so we really very carefully laid out what it was going to be. For me, even though it's not our biggest moment, I agree with Ant. The moment of him breastfeeding on the couch could be my award for the moment in Season 4 that I think is the craziest and that makes me cover my mouth every time and say, \"Oh, my God, I cannot believe we're doing this.\" Though there are bigger things, it's a wild thing to ask two actors to get in that position and ask him to simulate suckling her breast and his baby-like ecstasy at it. I get why that would be weird for an actor.\n\n2:38\n\nRelated\n\nImagine 'The Boys' in the DC Universe? It Almost Was\n\nWhat if Homelander was actually Superman?\n\nWas that reveal moment with Kessler the way you always wanted to reveal that, between Kessler and Becca, as Butcher has that realization?\n\nKRIPKE: I seem to remember, in an early version in the writers' room, we were gonna reveal it the way all of these movies reveal it, which is a character walks in the room and says, \"Who are you talking to?\" I was like, \"Well, let's not do that. Everyone's done that. Let's have the two imaginary characters in the room start yelling at each other. And then, that will be the reveal that they're both imaginary.\" It was just looking for a new angle on how to do one of those reveals.\n\nRelated\n\nThe 10 Wildest Moments from 'The Boys' (So Far), Ranked\n\nSupes gone wild!\n\nThe Boys is available to stream on Prime Video.

Plus, The Seven's latest addition Firecracker (Valorie Curry) takes it upon herself to follow a regimen of drugs to become Homelander's (Antony Starr) new milk supplier in a scene showrunner Eric Kripke admits is \"the craziest thing we've ever done.\"\n\nBelow, Kripke, Curry, and Minifie weigh in on the latest developments and tease what's next.\n\nThe Joe Kessler Reveal\n\nIt turns out that the Joe Kessler fans have come to know onscreen in Season 4 isn't the real Joe Kessler, but merely the one in Butcher's mind as the vigilante finally makes the connection that his friend never interacts with anyone but him... until he speaks directly to Butcher's vision of his dead wife Becca (Shantel VanSanten).\n\nThe twist is something that some fans have theorized for a while, and Kripke admits, \"I have noticed that some of the fans have predicted it much to my chagrin, but I don't know, maybe there's just too much knowledge about Fight Club.\" For fans who didn't see it coming, there was plenty that Kripke and his team did to keep viewers in the dark. \"We tried to be really tight with the rules. He's not talking to other people. He's not really lifting things. We tried to layer all that in,\" Kripke adds of Kessler's true nature being shrouded in mystery.\n\nWhen Kripke first introduced the idea to his former Supernatural collaborator, he says, \"I think the reveal was the thing that [Jeffrey Dean Morgan] was most excited about because, before the twist, he's an interesting but pretty straightforward CIA guy. And I think Jeffrey was jazzed by the idea that 'Oh, he's actually this walking nightmare who then moving forward can be a really interesting devil on [Butcher's] shoulder and a really interesting character that can just keep twisting the knife over and over again.\"\n\nAnd, as mentioned, above, if Kessler is the devil on Butcher's shoulder, Kripke told TV Insider earlier this season that \"Becca is the angel on [Butcher's] shoulder and she represents everything that's good about him.\" Which means that Kessler's as bad as they get. As fans may recall, he was the one swaying Butcher to poison Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) with cookies.\n\nAs for whether Kessler is a vision caused by the cancerous tumor growing in Butcher's brain or is instead a side-effect of the Compound-V Butcher injected into himself as a potential cure, Kripke says, \"I just think it's cancer and the dark side of Butcher that have all metastasized into the same thing. In our minds, all of his hate and anger have fed this side of him. So for us, it's more about his duality of who is the human part of him by Becca and what part of him is a monster that's represented by Kessler, but they're all Butcher, he clarifies.\n\nFirecracker Breastfeeds Homelander & His Mommy Issues\n\nBut Kessler's true nature wasn't the most bonkers aspect of the episode. That honor goes to Firecracker's offer to be Homelander's exclusive provider of breastmilk. Cornering the Supe in his apartment, Firecracker shocks him by releasing the med-induced liquids onto his shocked face, leading to the most bizarre breastfeeding setup.\n\nFor anyone who has kept track of the series, The Boys has consistently tracked Homelander's mommy issues, and Kripke admits, \"I don't know what further thing there is to do with mommy issues [apart from Homelander] literally climbing into someone's womb.... that's actually kind of a good idea. Maybe we'll do that next season,\" Kripke muses as he ponders the idea.\n\n\"But yeah, he's got a breastmilk obsession, and it's very logical in its own crazy way that someone who only wants to be slavishly devoted to Homelander would give him the forbidden thing he wants most in the world.\" When it came to putting the scene together, Kripke admits that when was watching it back, his initial reaction was, \"That's just the craziest thing I think I've ever seen. It's that moment, it's him breastfeeding. I can't watch it without covering my face. It's so bananas.\"\n\n\"It seems so inevitable,\" Curry notes of Homelander and Firecracker's next step. \"Of course, that happens.\" For the new star of the series, Curry says, \"I noticed, what I find ironic about Firecracker, about that scene and that being her emotional access point, is that for someone who is so superficially sexualized, [she] defies and fits into this hypersexual feminine mold, actually her explicit scene isn't sexual at all. It's quite pointedly not sexual. And I think that's great. I loved that we both came to the scene wanting it to be really vulnerable. And she has a fearlessness with him because she knows she's touching on exactly the right nerve.\"\n\nWhat excited Curry the most about the sequence is that it \"subverts the expectation about how Firecracker is going to elbow her way in.\" With her newfound purpose on The Seven as Homelander's main source of milk, we're sure there are dynamic changes ahead.\n\nTek Knight & Ashley's Sex Dungeon Journey\n\nIn one of the episode's sillier adventures, a disguised Hughie finds himself trapped in Tek Knight's sex dungeon being run by a domineering Ashley. The raunchy storyline was something Minifie was eager to tackle. \"When I first got this job, I always wondered what she does on her time off or what's going on with her at home behind the scenes, and we've gotten to explore a little bit more of that this year. And it's ever so exciting that this is what she's doing,\" Minifie notes.\n\n\"There's something very freeing about the dominatrix side of things,\" Minifie continues. \"Like if you know where the line is, the line that you can't cross, it's actually quite freeing to dance up to that edge, and that is something that Ashley doesn't have in the rest of her work life.\" Ultimately, Ashley is unaware that the subject of her domineering is actually Hughie, believing he is Webweaver (Dan Mousseau).\n\nWhen Tek Knight uncovers this, he threatens to mutilate Hughie, but the tables are turned when other members of The Boys attempt to save Hughie. In the end, Tek Knight, who was introduced in Gen V Season 1 didn't make it out of his sex dungeon as the butler who raised him, Elijah (Tyrone Benskin) choked him to death, allowing Hughie and the other Boys to escape.\n\n\"At this moment at least they're keeping Tek Knight's death kind of on the down low,\" Kripke says of the eventful demise. \"But he's so awful. He just deserves a unique spot in hell. And we were just so taken with the idea that you are a wealthy orphan-turned-vigilante who has a butler take care of you. And the Butler is finally so sick of your s**t that he murders you. Such a delightful play on a real famous superhero that we just couldn't avoid it,\" Kripke notes, seemingly referencing Batman.", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meaghan_darwish@tvinsider.com", "name": "Meaghan Darwish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantel_VanSanten", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shantel VanSanten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorie_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valorie Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fight Club (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominatrix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TV Guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Benskin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrone Benskin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BDSM"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elijah"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/the-boys-season-3-joe-kessler-imaginary-jeffrey-dean-morgan-karl-urban-shantel-vansanten-1014x570.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Read our privacy policy\n\nThe latest episode of The Boys has shocked fans on social media, with viewers calling it \"beyond obscene\" and \"f***ing weird\".\n\nThe hit Prime Video show is deep into its fourth season - which is officially the Amazon subscription service's penultimate installment - with only two episodes left to round out the eight-episode run.\n\nThe provocative superhero series has disturbed fans before, but the sixth episode of season four has taken things to a new level.\n\nTitled \"Dirty Business\", the episode follows Hughie (Jack Quaid) and the rest of The Boys as they sneak into a party at the home of billionaire superhero Tek Knight (Derek Wilson), with Hughie pretending to be the spider-themed superhero Webweaver.\n\nHughie spends most of the episode trapped in the \"Tek Cave\", a parody of Batman's lair that is kitted out to accommodate Tek Knight's many and varied sexual desires.\n\nOn X/Twitter, viewers say they've been left truly shocked by the prolonged graphic and sexual scenes.\n\nOne user wrote: \"Getting through episode 6 of The Boys is one of the hardest things I've ever done\n\n\"I'm only halfway through.\"\n\nAnother stated: \"I'm only 30 minutes into episode 6 of the Boys and it's already beyond obscene. How do they keep doing this?\"\n\nA third added: \"Episode 6 of The Boys was both insanely f***ing weird and... actually nevermind, it was just f***ing weird. Worse than Herogasm imo.\"\n\n\"Herogasm\", from the third season of The Boys, was set at an annual superhero sex festival and had previously been considered the most obscene in the show's history. It is also currently the show's highest-rated episode on IMDb with a rating of 9.6 stars out of 10.\n\n\"Dirty Business\" has proven to be more divisive, with the graphic nature of many scenes proving too much for some fans.\n\nOne X user wrote: \"This episode of #TheBoys was so disgusting they really do too much with all of the over the top graphic sexual content. It really takes away from the storyline.\"\n\nOn Reddit, another viewer added: \"Say what you want about season 4, but I think we can all agree this was the worst episode thus far. Just a hole lotta nothing.\"\n\nSome fans complained that the sheer number of outrageous scenes seemed to overshadow the story, with one writing: \"I know there is an overarching plot - but, man this season just feels like a collection of random, crazy scenes. Not nearly as focused as S1-3.\"\n\nAnother replied: \"Seems like this season is the weakest by far and unnecessary.\"\n\nLast month, The Boys showrunner Eric Kripke announced that show would come to an end after five seasons, writing on X that he was \"thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax.\"\n\nThe final two episodes of season four are set to arrive on Prime Video on 11 and 18 July.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek: Discovery (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMDb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/04/16/newFile-7.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706542", "eventUri": "eng-9706542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "dateEnd": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 2839, "textEnd": 2853}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

And I think Jeffrey was jazzed by the idea that 'Oh, he's actually this walking nightmare who then moving forward can be a really interesting devil on [Butcher's] shoulder and a really interesting character that can just keep twisting the knife over and over again.\"\n\nAnd, as mentioned, above, if Kessler is the devil on Butcher's shoulder, Kripke told TV Insider earlier this season that \"Becca is the angel on [Butcher's] shoulder and she represents everything that's good about him.\" Which means that Kessler's as bad as they get. As fans may recall, he was the one swaying Butcher to poison Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) with cookies.\n\nAs for whether Kessler is a vision caused by the cancerous tumor growing in Butcher's brain or is instead a side-effect of the Compound-V Butcher injected into himself as a potential cure, Kripke says, \"I just think it's cancer and the dark side of Butcher that have all metastasized into the same thing. In our minds, all of his hate and anger have fed this side of him. So for us, it's more about his duality of who is the human part of him by Becca and what part of him is a monster that's represented by Kessler, but they're all Butcher, he clarifies.\n\nFirecracker Breastfeeds Homelander & His Mommy Issues\n\nPrime Video\n\nBut Kessler's true nature wasn't the most bonkers aspect of the episode. That honor goes to Firecracker's offer to be Homelander's exclusive provider of breastmilk. Cornering the Supe in his apartment, Firecracker shocks him by releasing the med-induced liquids onto his shocked face, leading to the most bizarre breastfeeding setup.\n\nFor anyone who has kept track of the series, The Boys has consistently tracked Homelander's mommy issues, and Kripke admits, \"I don't know what further thing there is to do with mommy issues [apart from Homelander] literally climbing into someone's womb.... that's actually kind of a good idea. Maybe we'll do that next season,\" Kripke muses as he ponders the idea.\n\nMore from this section\n\nHot Lap Racing Official Car Roster Reveal Trailer\n\nThe First Descendant Official Lepic Character Gameplay Trailer\n\nAlec Baldwin 'Yelled' On Set Over Horse Riding Protocol Claims Safety Officer\n\n\"But yeah, he's got a breastmilk obsession, and it's very logical in its own crazy way that someone who only wants to be slavishly devoted to Homelander would give him the forbidden thing he wants most in the world.\" When it came to putting the scene together, Kripke admits that when was watching it back, his initial reaction was, \"That's just the craziest thing I think I've ever seen. It's that moment, it's him breastfeeding. I can't watch it without covering my face. It's so bananas.\"\n\n\"It seems so inevitable,\" Curry notes of Homelander and Firecracker's next step. \"Of course, that happens.\" For the new star of the series, Curry says, \"I noticed, what I find ironic about Firecracker, about that scene and that being her emotional access point, is that for someone who is so superficially sexualized, [she] defies and fits into this hypersexual feminine mold, actually her explicit scene isn't sexual at all. It's quite pointedly not sexual. And I think that's great. I loved that we both came to the scene wanting it to be really vulnerable. And she has a fearlessness with him because she knows she's touching on exactly the right nerve.\"\n\nWhat excited Curry the most about the sequence is that it \"subverts the expectation about how Firecracker is going to elbow her way in.\" With her newfound purpose on The Seven as Homelander's main source of milk, we're sure there are dynamic changes ahead.\n\nTek Knight & Ashley's Sex Dungeon Journey\n\nPrime Video\n\nIn one of the episode's sillier adventures, a disguised Hughie finds himself trapped in Tek Knight's sex dungeon being run by a domineering Ashley. The raunchy storyline was something Minifie was eager to tackle. \"When I first got this job, I always wondered what she does on her time off or what's going on with her at home behind the scenes, and we've gotten to explore a little bit more of that this year. And it's ever so exciting that this is what she's doing,\" Minifie notes.\n\n\"There's something very freeing about the dominatrix side of things,\" Minifie continues. \"Like if you know where the line is, the line that you can't cross, it's actually quite freeing to dance up to that edge, and that is something that Ashley doesn't have in the rest of her work life.\" Ultimately, Ashley is unaware that the subject of her domineering is actually Hughie, believing he is Webweaver (Dan Mousseau).\n\nWhen Tek Knight uncovers this, he threatens to mutilate Hughie, but the tables are turned when other members of The Boys attempt to save Hughie. In the end, Tek Knight, who was introduced in Gen V Season 1 didn't make it out of his sex dungeon as the butler who raised him, Elijah (Tyrone Benskin) choked him to death, allowing Hughie and the other Boys to escape.\n\nRelated\n\n'The Boys' Boss on Hughie's Goodbye, 'Gen V' Crossover & Those Supe Animals\n\n\"At this moment at least they're keeping Tek Knight's death kind of on the down low,\" Kripke says of the eventful demise. \"But he's so awful. He just deserves a unique spot in hell. And we were just so taken with the idea that you are a wealthy orphan-turned-vigilante who has a butler take care of you. And the Butler is finally so sick of your s**t that he murders you. Such a delightful play on a real famous superhero that we just couldn't avoid it,\" Kripke notes, seemingly referencing Batman.\n\nWhat will happen next?

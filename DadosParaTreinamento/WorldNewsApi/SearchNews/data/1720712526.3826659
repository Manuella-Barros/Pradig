{"id": 232038562, "title": "Magherafelt: planners give thumbs up to new 65-dwelling application", "text": "The matter was mentioned at the Planning Committee meeting of the local authority on June 4. The planning application was lodged by Turley, Hamilton House, Belfast, on behalf of Waterside Leisure (NI) Ltd, The Willows, Magherafelt. An existing building is going to be demolished to make way for the 65 dwellings consisting of 28 detached homes, 30 semi-detached units, one chalet bungalow and six apartments, with associated garages, open space and access on the site, directly to the south and east of Spires Manor, and south of Spires Integrated PS. The planning officers recommended approval in their report, however they also flagged up sewage disposal and noise issues requiring specific measures. They wrote: \u201cIt should be noted that NI Water recommended refusal due to network capacity issue. \u201cIt has been agreed that a condition be attached to any approval to ensure that no development take place until a method of sewage disposal is agreed with NI Water and Mid Ulster District Council. \u201cThe Strategic Planning Policy Statement (SPPS) states that the use of greenfield land for housing should be reduced and that where possible, brownfield sites should be used for provision of housing within settlements. \u201cIt also states that applications for major housing development should be located in areas where there is a concentration of employment, services and public transport, and where there is adequate infrastructure. \u201cI am content that a development of this size is suitable for this location, within the settlement limits of Magherafelt. \u201cDirect access from the site will not be permitted to the Magherafelt bypass. Access [will be] taken from Moneymore Road. \u201cThe existing mature vegetation and trees, located to the rear of the primary school, shall be retained and incorporated into the overall design and layout of the scheme, as an area of public open space and wildlife habitat. \u201cThe proposal involves an area of public open space to the rear of the primary school. It is designed to be incorporated into the site and to be utilised, with link paths through the site. \u201cThe landscaping along the north boundaries ensures the site is adequately screened from the adjoining housing development at Spires Manor, and from Spires Integrated Primary School. \u201cThe proposed development is located in close proximity to the Moneymore Road and the A31 Magherafelt bypass, and as a result Environmental Health require that the residential amenity of future occupants is protected. \u201cEnvironmental Health were consulted as a Noise Impact Assessment was submitted and reviewed by Environmental Health. They had no objection to the proposal, subject to conditions being applied to ensure that glazing installed is capable of providing sound reduction. \u201cA condition will be added to ensure an acoustic barrier is erected and permanently retained on site to provide noise protection. \u201cPrior to the occupation of any dwellings the acoustic barrier shall be erected within the site.The barrier shall be constructed of either masonry or timber panelling (close lapped with no gaps).

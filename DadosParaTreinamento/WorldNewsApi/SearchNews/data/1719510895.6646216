I'm your host, Andrew J. Campa. I hope you're enjoying the holiday weekend. Here's what you need to know to start your weekend: Los Angeles is in the midst of a cookie craze.Regulators blame Sheriff\u2019s Department for fire that killed deputy.Women's hoops phenom Caitlin Clark is electric in L.A. visit.And here's today's e-newspaper Cookies are enjoying a renaissance in Los Angeles. Nowadays, the city is flush with standout bakeries ready to satisfy every type of craving from these joyful delights. Even famed East Coast bakeries want to jump into the action, with New York titan Levain landing on Larchmont Boulevard with their signature 6-ounce cookies. Bustling lines are expected at James Beard-nominated Gusto Bread in Long Beach, with customers stocking up on sweet and savory pastries that draw from the owners\u2019 Mexican and Argentine heritages. West Adams' news spot \u2014 Fleurs et Sel \u2014 pulls inspiration from France with fat, chewy cookies that weave floral ingredients with nostalgic flavors. History repeats itself This recent cookie explosion mirrors one nearly 50 years ago. In 1975, former music industry business manager Wally Amos opened what some consider the first gourmet or upscale cookie bakery on Sunset Boulevard. He named the shop \"Famous Amos\" (yeah, that Famous Amos). Within 10 years, Famous Amos boasted 70 retail outlets, while selling about 80% of its cookies in supermarkets. The idea came after Amos received rave reviews from fellow industry executives after baking and bringing cookies to meetings. In 1977, Mrs. Field's of Palo Alto, David's Cookies of New York, founded by a classically trained French chef, and Great American Cookies, home of the cookie cake, were all born due in part to Amos' success. What this new wave of cookie bakery growth will produce should be a fun and delicious story to follow. Meanwhile, check out our list of 24 of the best cookies in L.A. to crush your sweet tooth. Here are some of our favorites. Alfajor de nuez at Gusto Bread A child waiting in line on a recent Sunday at Gusto wailed to his dad, \u201cWhy does this place have to be so popular?!\u201d Such is the demand for breads and pastries from the Long Beach bakery that once operated inside Arturo Enciso and Ana Bel\u00e9n Salatino\u2019s living room. On many days, there will be a long line (sorry, kid!) for Enciso\u2019s rustic loaves and baked goods such as springy, cheesy jalape\u00f1o bolillos and cocoa-sprinkled chocolate conchas. As with his polvorones, Enciso uses walnuts for the alfajores, the South American sandwich cookies that are typically extra-soft, melt-in-your-mouth and pale (as in no browned edges). Gusto\u2019s alfajores are nutty, soft but toothsome and slightly browned. Almond cookie from Largwa The signature sweets found via the baker\u2019s Largwa pop-ups are almost always cookies. The self-described \u201ccookie girlie\u201d riffs on a number of classics \u2014 including thumbprint cookies, Oreos, madeleines and a s\u2019mores-and-chocolate chip mashup. However, one of the least flashy is also one of the best: the brown-butter almond cookie, a nod to the crumbly, crunchy almond cookie, and especially the version made by the L.A.-based Amay\u2019s Bakery & Noodle Co., which sells wholesale almond cookies far and wide. Amaretti ai pignoli at Eagle Rock Italian Bakery & Deli In the hall of great Italian cookies, it\u2019s hard to beat the amaretti ai pignoli. The chewy, gluten-free treats rely on almond paste for their nutty, soft center and egg whites for an almost meringue-like outer shell, while an onslaught of pine nuts forms a just-toasted crunchy layer atop it all. So few bakeries and restaurants make these fresh year-round in Los Angeles, but Eagle Rock Italian Bakery & Deli has been at it for more than 70 years. \u201cNobody does this,\u201d co-owner Anthony Cafarchia laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s too much work.\u201d Policing, courts and politics Skipped inspections, lax maintenance: Regulators blame Sheriff\u2019s Department for fire that killed deputy.Man arrested in attack on UCLA pro-Palestinian protesters.A slingshot-wielding vandal shattered glass in Azusa for years.

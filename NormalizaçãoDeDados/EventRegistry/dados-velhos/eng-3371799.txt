Bro said \"three more frantic messages from press secretaries\" followed throughout the day Wednesday, but said she did not immediately respond because she was home recovering from the service.\n\nIt was not until Thursday night that Bro said she was able to actually watch the news and, she said, see a clip of Trump's comments herself.\n\n\"I'm not talking to the president now,\" she said Friday. When asked what message she might have for Trump, Bro said: \"Think before you speak.\"\n\n['They tried to kill my child to shut her up,' Heather Heyer's mother mourns at funeral for woman killed during Nazi protest in Charlottesville]\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday regarding Bro's remarks.\n\nBro had also told MSNBC on Thursday that she received death threats since speaking about her daughter at Heyer's memorial service in Charlottesville on Wednesday.\n\n\"They tried to kill my child to shut her up, but guess what, you just magnified her,\" Bro had said during the service, prompting an ovation lasting nearly a minute and a half.\n\nSusan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed on Aug. 12 in Charlottesville while protesting white nationalists urged others to fight injustice and speak up. (The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has drawn intense criticism for his response to the chaos in Charlottesville. His first remarks, delivered on Saturday after Heyer was killed, prompted a backlash when Trump denounced \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and did not specifically single out white supremacists or neo-Nazis.\n\nOn Monday, Trump then called out those groups by name, saying that \"racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs.\" Bro released a statement that day thanking Trump for his \"words of comfort and denouncing those who promote violence and hatred.\"\n\nHowever, a day later Trump returned to his declaration that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence during a remarkable news conference in New York.\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump also offered kind words for Heyer and thanked Bro for her statement about him.\n\n[Mother of slain Charlottesville protester says she's received death threats]\n\nTrump also pilloried James Alex Fields Jr., who police said plowed into Heyer and other counterprotesters in Charlottesville on Saturday, as \"a disgrace to himself\" and \"a murderer.\" Though Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the attack fits the definition of domestic terrorism, Trump declined to call it terrorism when asked by a reporter.\n\nThe White House has not explained why officials waited four days before trying to connect Trump with Heyer's relatives. In November, after a San Antonio police officer was shot and killed, Trump -- then the president-elect -- called his relatives the following day. Trump also met personally with the victims of an attack at Ohio State University carried out by a Somali refugee.\n\nOn Tuesday, during the same news conference, Trump did not say whether he will travel to Charlottesville.

On Friday morning, Bro was very candid about her opinion of POTUS when she spoke with Robin Roberts on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nAcknowledging how difficult a time this must be for Bro and her family, Roberts asked whether she had spoken with Trump directly yet:\n\n\"I have not and now I will not. At first I just missed his calls. The first call, it looked like, actually came during the funeral. I didn't even see that message. There were three more frantic messages from press secretaries throughout the day and I didn't know why -- that would have been on Wednesday. And I was home recovering from the exhaustion of the funeral. So I thought, 'Well I'll get to him later,' and then I had more meetings to establish her foundation. So I hadn't really watched the news until last night. And... I'm not talking to the president now. I'm sorry. After what he said about my child. And it's not that I saw someone else's tweets about him; I saw an actual clip of him at a press conference equating the protestors 'like Miss Heyer' with the KKK and the white supremacists.\"\n\nRoberts reminded Heyer that after Trump's initial statement on Monday -- a statement where he begrudgingly mentioned the hate groups that were responsible for Heyer's death by name -- Bro had thanked the president. Roberts wanted to know if it was his disastrous follow-up presser on Tuesday -- in which he stated that white supremacists could be \"very fine people,\" too -- that had swayed her opinion. \"Absolutely,\" replied Bro:\n\n\"You can't wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying 'I'm sorry.' I'm not forgiving for that.\"\n\nBefore you turn away from your computer in disgust, let me give you a brief reminder of the timeline here: Heyer was killed on Saturday, and her name was released to the public on Sunday. On Monday, Trump was dragged in front of a microphone and forced to say that what happened in Charlottesville was bad, though his staff later confirmed that he had no intention of visiting Charlottesville (which, even by car, is a mere two-and-a-half hours from the White House).\n\nOn Tuesday, throwing off whatever shackles had been placed around his mouth the day before, he gave his now-infamous \"both sides\" speech, and actually boasted that Bro had \"the nicest things to say about me.\" (Because Donald Trump would never miss an opportunity to make something about him.) Yet Bro says her first call from Trump didn't come until Wednesday -- in the middle of her daughter's funeral, no less.\n\nOne can only imagine that those \"frantic\" follow-up calls she described were the result of Team Trump placing a new urgency on making sure that the toddler they clean up after actually spoke to Heyer's family. Odd that he had plenty of time to accuse Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier of ripping off Americans, remind everyone that the White House was undergoing renovations and he really was working, criticize the Fake News Media for being shocked by his batshit crazy press conference and tweet about how good it felt to be home in New York... but didn't have 15 minutes to call the family of a young woman who was killed simply for thinking that Hitler was not a very fine person.\n\nHow's that \"both sides\" argument working for you now, Mr. President?\n\nWATCH: \"You can't wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying I'm sorry.\" Mother of Charlottesville victim speaks out. pic.twitter.com/vNiGNgFERi\n\n-- Good Morning America (@GMA) August 18, 2017\n\n[screen shot: Good Morning America]", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "wgt": 100, "id": 706, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100, "id": 926, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303765", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304070", "label": {"eng": "News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306129", "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307750", "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309070", "label": {"eng": "News conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "321096", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323086", "label": {"eng": "Toddler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "373025", "label": {"eng": "Hate group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "380721", "label": {"eng": "News satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(newscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "694329", "label": {"eng": "Robin Roberts (newscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "961781", "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Frazier"}}]}

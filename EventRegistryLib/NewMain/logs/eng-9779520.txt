She won the Emmy Award for outstanding guest comedy performance in 2020 and another Emmy for her hosting role on \"SNL\" in 2021.\n\nHarris herself has said that she likes Rudolph's impression of her.\n\n\"I grew up watching Saturday Night Live,\" she told Seth Meyers in a 2019 interview. \"The thought that anyone would be in any way depicting me on 'Saturday Night Live' was just -- I was a bit overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"I will tell you that I fully intend to make sure she (Rudolph) has a full eight years of work on 'SNL,\" Harris joked at the time.\n\nNo word yet on who might play former President Donald Trump this upcoming season, but James Austin Johnson has portrayed him on the long-running sketch show most recently. With Rudolph returning as Harris, she's certainly going to need a sparring partner as the race heats up.\n\nSeason 50 of \"Saturday Night Live\" is set to begin on Sept. 28.\n\n___\n\nStay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "roanoke.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roanoke Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_wagmeister@roanoke.com", "name": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maya Rudolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Austin_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Austin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Meyers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seth Meyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/68/3685d293-267e-57ed-9c6d-3ff2a57a7af1/66aa6c9ebde69.preview.jpg?crop=1581%2C830%2C155%2C205&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779520", "eventUri": "eng-9779520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-28", "textStart": 2181, "textEnd": 2189}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

That girl was me.\"\n\nThe last time the actress appeared as the VP was in the 2021 episode she hosted, which later earned her another Emmy.

Following President Biden's announcement that he was stepping back from running for reelection, Vice President Harris emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee.

The actress is set to reprise her role as Vice President Kamala Harris on NBC's late-night sketch comedy series through 2024, Deadline reports.\n\nWith Rudolph's presence on SNL ramping up this fall, pre-production on her Apple TV+ series has been put on pause. Loot Season 3 was set to start filming on August 26, but it has been delayed for scheduling reasons. Rudolph stars in and executive produces the comedy series. Rudolph recently earned a 2024 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nRudolph won an Emmy for her portrayal of the first female vice president. The Bridesmaids alum first played Harris in 2019 when Eddie Murphy hosted. At the time, Harris responded on Twitter (now X), That girl being played by @MayaRudolph on @nbcsnl? That girl was me.\"\n\nThe last time the actress appeared as the VP was in the 2021 episode she hosted, which later earned her another Emmy. Martin Short played Harris' husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. During the 2020 presidential election cycle, Jim Carrey played Joe Biden on SNL alongside Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump.\n\nRelatedAll of Maya Rudolph's 'SNL' Impressions of Kamala Harris So Far\n\n\"She's kind of like a cool mom or like a fun aunt,\" Rudolph previously told THR about playing Harris. \"She's cool, but she's also responsible. So what does that look like? I didn't really know exactly how to do her, but I kept going back to the idea of those parents that are like, 'You kids can smoke weed, but you have to do it at my house.' I'm not saying that's Kamala! But that's the feeling: cool but there are definitely rules at her house.\"\n\nMore from this section Tragic Details About Celine Dion's Oldest Son Rene-Charles The Sketchiest Things About Raquel Leviss Food Challenges Beard Meats Food Star Adam Moran Failed\n\nAs in previous years, SNL will be covering the 2024 presidential election.

Rudolph was a cast member on SNL from 2000 to 2007 and has since hosted three times, in 2012, 2021, and this year, which earned her an Emmy nomination for Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. She will now make a big return to the series as one of her most popular characters, playing Vice President and potential Presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Rudolph will reprise her role as Kamala Harris on SNL during the last few months of the Presidential Election race. Production on Season 3 of Rudolph's Apple TV+ comedy series Loot has been delayed to accommodate Rudolph's commitments to SNL. Given that Loot and SNL are both produced by Universal Television, the change was easy to accommodate, but production on Loot will likely not commence until after the election, as Rudolph is not expected to play Harris full-time on SNL if she gets the Democratic nomination and wins the Presidency.\n\nSNL Presidents Saturday Night Live Comedy\n\nRelease Date October 11, 1975 Main Genre Comedy Seasons 49 Studio NBC Creator Lorne Michaels\n\nRudolph first played Harris in an SNL cold open on December 21, 2019, and immediately became a fan favorite. Despite a small guest role, the impression became an instant meme online and Rudolph went on to win the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2021 for her portrayal of Kamala Harris. As soon as Joe Biden stepped down from running in the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Kamala Harris, fans began hoping for Harris to reprise her role.\n\nRudolph previously reprised her role in the lead-up to the 2020 Presidential election, where she was paired with Jim Carrey as Joe Biden. This stunt casting tends to draw big viewership numbers but also creates an issue when the race is over, and SNL needs a full-time person to play the President. Following Carrey's stint as Joe Biden on SNL, Alex Moffatt, James Austin Johnson, and Mikey Day have each taken a spin with the role. Rudolph has a short window of time before she needs to return to the set of Loot, and SNL will need to find a new long-term Kamala Harris.

The role even earned her an Emmy Award.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden endorsed VP Kamala Harris to succeed him as he bowed out of the 2024 election, people were saying that this could be a huge moment for Maya Rudolph to come back to SNL full time.\n\nAnd they're right.\n\nThe upcoming milestone 50th season of SNL is set to premiere Sept. 28 and mere weeks before the show returned, it was confirmed that Maya will reprise her Emmy-winning role as Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday Night Live.\n\nSo far, it sounds like she's slated to stick with her old comedy stomping grounds through the \"final stretch of the 2024 Presidential campaign,\" according to Deadline.\n\nThat means, we'll get her until at least November.\n\nTurns out, Maya's return was so in demand that pre-production on Season 3 of her Apple TV+ comedy series Loot, which was scheduled to begin filming Aug. 26, has been paused.\n\nAccording to sources that spoke to Deadline, the cast and crew of the comedy series, which Maya headlines and executive produces, were told earlier this week that production has been pushed for \"scheduling reasons.\"\n\nAka, Maya is needed back in Studio 8H.\n\nAnd thank goodness, because fans really wouldn't have it any other way!\n\nFollowing President Biden's announcement, Vice President Kamala Harris received ringing endorsements from celebrities, voters, fellow Democratic elected officials, and donors.\n\nAmidst the discourse -- from ironic Harris memes to contrarian pouting to more serious conversations about this historic moment -- one name kept coming up: Maya Rudolph.\n\nMaya Rudolph's portrayal of Kamala Harris began during the 2020 election cycle. Her 2019 debut in the role on Saturday Night Live was during the Democratic Presidential Primaries, and came twelve years after she left SNL.\n\nRudolph won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of then-Senator Harris.\n\nSNL is famous for its political parodies and its (often frustratingly moderate) commentary during election cycles and political scandals. Even in that context, Rudolph's role as Harris is an all-time favorite.\n\nWhen it comes to something as serious as this Presidential election, people are eager to pivot to something a little lighter. Celebrating what this means for Maya Rudolph is much lower-stakes than the 2024 election.\n\nAs you can see from the above tweet, people are anticipating more pay for Rudolph. Yes, SNL could'e cast someone else ... but it would not have gone over well with viewers.\n\nEven more are looking forward to Rudolph raking in more Emmy Awards. Especially if Vice President Harris becomes President Harris, leading to a potential decade of skits starring Maya Rudolph.\n\nObviously, the 2024 election is going to be contentious. There's a lot at stake -- from how the world views America to how many of us fear becoming political refugees if a second Trump presidency and Project 2025 become a living nightmare.\n\nEven within Democratic circles, there are real concerns about how much influence wealthy donors had over President Biden withdrawing from the race. That's not on Harris, but it's a topic of discussion.\n\nAnd, of course, there are concerns about Vice President Harris' record from her days as a prosecutor, even if it varies from her stated positions on things like marijuana legalization and trans rights. Politics is a complex topic, and can tear good friends apart even if they agree on virtually everything.\n\nComedy is just a coping strategy. It doesn't fix political tensions. No amount of very moderate political humor on SNL is going to fix the rot that grips so many in this country. White nationalism, state-mandated births, an out-of-control SCOTUS, genocide in Gaza, and more can't be cured by laughter. That requires a coalition of Americans working to fix things.\n\nBut there is no sense in wallowing in misery. Giving in to doom and despair, suffering because the world is a serious place? That doesn't help anything. It also leads to burnout.\n\nHaving some laughs while continuing the long road to fix our nation's heart and soul is a good thing. And we don't mind if Maya Rudolph wins some more awards along the way.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She won an Emmy in 2020 as guest actress in a comedy for the role.\n\nOn July 21, President Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election and later that day, endorsed Harris to replace him atop the ticket. His self-removal from the race made way for Harris to become the presumptive Democratic nominee -- and made room for Rudolph to reprise her role as the former California senator.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nMaya Rudolph's 'SNL' return follows calls for her to reprise role as Kamala Harris\n\nLast week, the internet rallied for Rudolph to return as Harris on \"SNL.\"\n\n\"Maya Rudolph plsssssss get back in costume,\" another user Nicole Raquel Dennis wrote in a post on X alongside a video of Harris.\n\n\"Hope Maya Rudolph has cleared her schedule,\" journalist Yashar Ali said.\n\n\"Maya Rudolph coif that hair and slip that pantsuit on baby.

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. The Big Picture Maya Rudolph to reprise her role as Kamala Harris on SNL for the upcoming season, portraying her through at least the 2024 election. Rudolph first portrayed Harris in 2019, generating online fervor and winning an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress as the VP. SNL 's upcoming 50th season is expected to be a celebration of its history, with special episodes and retrospectives planned.\n\nLive from New York, a familiar face is set to return to Studio 8H. Maya Rudolph will reprise her role as Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday Night Live when the show returns this September, according to Deadline. Rudolph will portray Harris through at least the 2024 presidential election in November, given that Harris is now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race.\n\nRudolph first portrayed Harris on Saturday Night Live in 2019, when Harris, then a senator from California, first launched a presidential campaign. While Rudolph's portrayal was relegated to only a few lines in the first cold open, her version of Harris as a feisty, meme-infused candidate generated fervor online, and even led to Harris herself weighing in on social media. After Biden tapped Harris as his vice presidential running mate, Rudolph continued to portray her after the pair won the 2020 presidential election, including a notable episode in which she appeared alongside Martin Short as Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nRudolph won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress for her portrayal of the vice president, so it is unsurprising that SNL would be eager to have her back - and she is reportedly even shifting her schedule around to do so. Pre-production on Season 3 of the Rudolph-starring Apple TV+ series Loot has been paused as a result of SNL scheduling, according to Deadline. It was previously slated to begin at the end of August, though it appears that vice presidential duties have now taken over for Rudolph.\n\n'SNL's Upcoming Season Will Be Its 50th\n\nThe upcoming season of Saturday Night Live will be a big one, as it marks 50 years since the show first hit the airwaves. The live sketch comedy, created by Lorne Michaels, became known for launching the careers of stars like Jim Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Chris Farley, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, and many others. It has never shied away from politics, and over the years has notably parodied presidential administrations, including spoofs of Dana Carvey as President George H.W. Bush, Phil Hartman as President Bill Clinton, Will Ferrell as President George W. Bush, Jay Pharoah as President Barack Obama, Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, and Jim Carrey as Biden.\n\nThe upcoming 50th season of the show is expected to be a celebration of the sketch series' history, and will feature special episodes in addition to other restrospectives (including a three-hour special in February 2025). SNL comes from NBC and Universal Television and is executive produced by Michaels through his Broadway Video banner.\n\nSNL Season 50 will premiere on NBC on Sept. 28.

Well, it looks like Deadline Hollywood has the exclusive answer, confirming that Rudolph will reprise her take on VP Harris during SNL's upcoming 50th season through the final run of the 2024 Presidential campaign. Reportedly, pre-production on Rudolph's Apple TV+ series Loot has hit the pause button - with \"scheduling\" being the reason given (with Universal Television producing both Loot and SNL, schedule adjustments between the two were able to be worked out).\n\nDuring Season 45 (December 21, 2019), 2020 presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren (McKinnon), Andrew Yang (Yang), Pete Buttigieg (Jost), Amy Klobuchar (Dratch), Bernie Sanders (David), Joe Biden (Jason Sudeikis) and Michael Bloomberg (Armisen) face off in a debate. Though we get an appearance from Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump, it's Rudolph who steals the show one more time: \"Look, when [Trump] gets to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he's going to wish he'd never heard my name. It's pronounced 'Kamala.' It rhymes with 'Pamela.' It ain't Camilla Cabello, it's just Kamala.\"\n\nDuring Season 46 (October 3, 2020), Chris Wallace (Beck Bennett) moderates the first presidential debate between Donald Trump (Baldwin) and Joe Biden (Jim Carrey).\n\nHere's a look at the intro video for Carrey's Joe Biden and Rudolph's Harris ahead of their SNL appearance on October 3, 2020 (with host Chris Rock and musical guest Megan Thee Stallion). Following that, we have an intro for Rudolph heading into the October 10, 2020, SNL show (with host Bill Burr and musical guest Morgan Wallen).", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType":

She won an Emmy in 2020 as guest actress in a comedy for the role.\n\nOn July 21, President Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election and later that day, endorsed Harris to replace him atop the ticket. His self-removal from the race made way for Harris to become the presumptive Democratic nominee -- and made room for Rudolph to reprise her role as the former California senator.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nLast week, the internet rallied for Rudolph to return as Harris on \"SNL.\"\n\n\"Maya Rudolph plsssssss get back in costume,\" another user Nicole Raquel Dennis wrote in a post on X alongside a video of Harris.\n\n\"Hope Maya Rudolph has cleared her schedule,\" journalist Yashar Ali said.\n\n\"Maya Rudolph coif that hair and slip that pantsuit on baby.

I'm that person that when I am telling a story about someone, when I [say] the words that they said, I usually say it in that person's voice.

Production for her Apple TV+ series 'Loot' has been delayed to accommodate her SNL schedule.\n\nMaya Rudolph makes a highly anticipated return to 'Saturday Night Live' (SNL) as she reprises her role as Vice President Kamala Harris. This move comes as the NBC comedy show prepares to cover the final stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign, according to Deadline.\n\nRudolph's portrayal of Harris has earned widespread acclaim, including an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2020. The character, affectionately dubbed 'Mamala,' has become a fan-favorite, particularly since Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal on July 21.\n\nFans advocated for Rudolph's SNL return, and their wishes have been granted. According to Deadline, pre-production for Season 3 of her Apple TV+ comedy series 'Loot', initially slated to begin on August 26, has been postponed to allow for her SNL commitments.\n\nThe series, produced by NBC's Universal Television, will see its schedule adjusted to fit Rudolph's SNL duties. This scheduling flexibility is possible as both SNL and 'Loot' are products of Universal Television and Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video, Deadline reports.\n\nSNL's 50th season will premiere on September 28. Rudolph's return follows her impactful role during the 2020 Presidential election, when she and Jim Carrey, who played Joe Biden, featured prominently throughout the season.\n\nCarrey even relocated to New York to be closer to the SNL production. Rudolph's debut as Harris came in a memorable cold open on December 21, 2019, during an episode hosted by Eddie Murphy.\n\nHer portrayal rapidly gained popularity, becoming a viral meme and cementing her status in political satire. She reprised the role several times post-2020 election, including during her March 2021 hosting of SNL, which earned her a second Emmy for Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nCurrently, Rudolph is nominated for four Emmys, including Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for 'Loot' and Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her latest SNL appearance.

While Harris lost the primary, her eventual selection as Biden's running mate prompted Rudolph to return to the show for the 2020 election cycle (where she was notably partnered with Jim Carey, who stepped in to impersonate Biden).\n\nThe last time Rudolph played Harris was a March 2021 episode of SNL that Rudolph hosted. The sketch found Rudolph's Harris leading a \"Unity Seder\" to celebrate Passover, with Martin Short stepping in to play Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\nRudolph has earned a ton of praise for her Harris impression, and even a pair of Emmys.

Deadline was the first to report the story.\n\nRudolph, who has previously played Harris, will reprise the role until the 2024 election season.The actress is no stranger to this persona, having played the politician since 2019, when Harris, 59, ran for president in 2020.\n\nFollowing her first appearance, the VP took to X to celebrate the honour with a GIF of Rudolph proclaiming \"No one is above the law!\"\n\n\"That girl portrayed by @MayaRudolph on @nbcsnl?\" \"That girl was me,\" she said in the post.\n\n\"YES SHE WAS SENATOR HARRIS!!!\" Rudolph reacted.\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, even appeared to prophesy the future, commenting: \"Dear @MayaRudolph: @KamalaHarris' husband is still LMFAO this morning.

I'm the type of person who, when narrating a tale about someone, usually says the words in that person's voice.

Harris, but I have to tell you, when I got to [SNL] and they put the wig on me, it was done,\" she told the crowd.\n\nHarris entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on July 21, when incumbent Joe Biden declared that he would not seek re-election. That same day, he took to X (previously Twitter) to support Harris for President.\n\n\"My first decision as the party's 2020 contender was to name Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's the best decision I've ever made,\" he wrote. \"Today, I'd like to express my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be our party's nominee this year.

Universal Television and Lorne Michael's Broadway Video delayed production on Rudolph's Apple TV+ series \"Loot\" allowing her the time needed to play Harris once again, THR reported.\n\nRudolph originally played Harris, first as a candidate for president and then as Biden's running mate, from 2019 to 2021.

In the weeks since, several celebrities have shown their support for Harris, including Shonda Rhimes, Spike Lee, and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nThe \"Sorry\" singer gave Harris permission to use her song, \"Freedom,\" throughout the presidential hopeful's campaign. The vice president walked out to the 2016 song, which was featured on Beyonc\u00e9's groundbreaking album \"Lemonade,\" during her first official visit to her campaign headquarters on July 22.\n\n\"SNL\" will premiere its milestone 50th season on Sept. 28.", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mariel_turner@thegrio.com", "name":

During the episode, she sparred with Woody Harrelson's Joe Biden and riffed on Harris's most memorable lines from the first round of Democratic primary debates.\n\nShe then famously brought back her impersonation of Harris for the show's 46th season in 2021.\n\nSince President Joe Biden abandoned his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris to replace him in the 2024 presidential race against Donald Trump, SNL fans have been begging for Rudolph's return.\n\nNow, according to Deadline, it appears fans' wishes have been answered as Rudolph is set to reprise her Harris character for the show's 50th season, which returns on September 28 and runs through the November 2024 presidential election.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that there were no discussions about Rudolph returning to the show, as her schedule was filled with other obligations, including pre-production on season three of her Apple TV+ comedy series Loot.\n\nHowever, pre-production for the show, which was scheduled to begin filming on August 26, has been halted, Deadline reports.\n\nMembers of the cast and crew told the outlet that production on the show - produced by Universal Television, a division of NBC - had been pushed back to January 3, 2025, due to scheduling reasons.\n\nBack in 2019, during an appearance on MSNBC, Harris joked that she intended to \"keep Maya Rudolph in work for the next eight years.\"\n\nRudolph earned her first Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her 2019 performance as Harris.\n\nThe Bridesmaids actor most recently landed four Emmy nods: two for her hosting stint on SNL's Mother's Day episode, one for her voice-over work in Netflix's Big Mouth and another for her leading performance in Apple TV+'s comedy series Loot.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has surpassed the necessary threshold of support from delegates to secure the Democratic nomination. An official vote to ratify Harris as the nominee will begin on Thursday before concluding on Monday (August 5).\n\nOn Tuesday (August 6), she will hold a rally in Philadelphia, where she will appear with her official running mate. At the moment, there are three names who have risen to the top of Harris' shortlist after North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper took himself out of contention to be Harris' VP.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "inga_parkel@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Inga Parkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maya Rudolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Harrelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woody Harrelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mouth_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Mouth (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Guest_Actress_in_a_Comedy_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Television", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_North_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of North Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/10e6b24598d698d753cd90c8adae2ba7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779520", "eventUri": "eng-9779520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-28", "textStart": 800, "textEnd": 812}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 1184, "textEnd": 1193}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2143, "textEnd": 2151}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2167, "textEnd": 2175}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

After Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July and Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Saturday Night Live had to upend its entire plan for the fall. Fortunately, they have a familiar face to rely on. Maya Rudolph, who played Harris throughout the 2020 election cycle, will reportedly be returning to the show to play Harris through the 2024 election.\n\nAccording to reporting in Variety, Rudolph was preparing to shoot the third season of her Apple TV+ series Loot, but production on that show has been delayed so that she can return to Studio 8H.\n\nKamala - SNL\n\nRudolph's first outing as Harris was in December of 2019, and she went on to earn a Guest Actress Emmy for her performance in the role. She returned at various points throughout the 2020 election series to play Harris alongside Jim Carrey as Joe Biden. She also took on the role when she hosted the show in 2021 and won another Emmy for her efforts.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSaturday Night Live has not put out any official statement confirming the news, but the decision makes sense, at least in the short term. It seems likely that Rudolph's Harris will be taking on James Austin Johnson's Donald Trump in various skits throughout the fall. It's unclear what the show's plan will be if Harris wins the election. Rudolph, who was a cast member on the show from 2000 to 2007, has been game to return frequently, but may not want to rejoin the cast full-time. At least through the election, though, it seems like she's down to come back.\n\nEditors' Recommendations 10 great reasons to tune into the Paris Olympics 2024 A new poll suggests F1 2024 has a viewership problem -- here's why", "source": {"uri": "themanual.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manual"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_allen@themanual.com", "name": "Joe Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maya Rudolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Carrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Austin_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Austin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Maya-Rudolph-as-Kamala-Harris.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779520", "eventUri": "eng-9779520", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The sketch also featured host Woody Harrelson as Joe Biden, Larry David as Bernie Sanders, Kate McKinnon as Elizabeth Warren, and Bowen Yang as Andrew Yang.\n\nElsewhere in the sketch, Maya/Kamala refers to herself as a \"funt\" (fun aunt) -- \"the kind of funt that will give you weed and then arrest you for having weed,\" she clarifies. \"Can I win the presidency? Probably not, I dunno. Can I successfully seduce a much younger man? You better funtin' believe it.\" She also repeatedly likens herself to a TNT drama (\"I'm Rizzoli and I'm Isles\"), and after Harrelson's Biden tells a rambling story about an old acquaintance named Corn Pop, Rudolph's Harris asserts, \"That little Corn Pop was me.\"\n\nHarris responded to the sketch on social media, writing \"That girl being played by @MayaRudolph on @nbcsnl? That girl was me,\" alongside a GIF of Rudolph from the episode.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRudolph next appeared as Harris in another Democratic debate sketch on the Nov. 23 episode of the same season, which also saw Harrelson and David reprise their roles from the previous debate as well as Rachel Dratch as Amy Klobuchar, Fred Armisen as Michael Bloomberg, and host Will Ferrell as Tom Steyer.\n\nHarris begins her time with a clunkier portmanteau. \"The funt is back, baby, America's fun aunt. I'm also America's cool aunt: the c... -- you know what? Let's not do that,\" she says. \"Tonight, I'm not gonna worry about the polling numbers. I'm just gonna have fun and see if I can get some viral moments. Mama needs a GIF.\"\n\nKamaya then spends the rest of the sketch inelegantly attempting to create meme-able moments, including an \"Old Town Road\" TikTok dance and saying \"Gonna tell my kids this was Michelle Obama\" while winking.\n\nRudolph's next appearance -- another Democratic debate during the Dec. 21 episode -- came after Harris dropped out of the race. Harris crashes the broadcast with a martini: \"Oh, this is a debate? Honestly, I had no idea,\" she says. \"I was just in the neighborhood. But while I'm here: I just wanna show you how good you could've had it, America.\" In an already dated pop cultural reference, she quotes Lizzo's \"Truth Hurts\": \"You could've had a bad bitch!\"\n\nLater, Harris insists that she'll take Trump down as a senator. \"I'll still beat Trump, because when he gets to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he's gonna wish he never heard my name.\" She then breaks into song and exits the stage. \"Funt out, byeee.\" Rudolph ultimately won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her work in the episode.\n\nRudolph's tenure as Harris seemed finished once she dropped out of the race -- until Joe Biden selected her as his running mate, which the actress learned during an interview with EW. \"Oh s---,\" Rudolph said upon finding out about Harris' VP candidacy. \"Ruh roh.\" After fellow interviewee Wanda Sykes joked \"Somebody's gonna be very busy now,\" Rudolph said, \"I love going to the show. Any excuse I can get, I love. I just didn't really anticipate traveling during a pandemic, but if there's anyone that can work it out I'm sure Lorne [Michaels] has some sort of invisible helicopter that can get me there.\"\n\nFollowing a 10-month hiatus, Rudolph returned to the role in the season 46 premiere on Oct. 3, 2020. Harris interrupts a Fox News debate between Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump and Jim Carrey's Joe Biden, attempting to settle the conflict between the two elderly men as if they're toddlers. \"Let Mamala go to work,\" she says. \"America needs a WAP: Woman As President. But for now, I'll settle for HVPIC: Hot Vice President in Charge.\"\n\nIn the next episode, Rudolph's Harris debates Vice President Pence, played by Beck Bennett.\n\n\"That's right, the sentator from Kamalafornia is present,\" she says as she enters the stage. She also makes a meal of the real Harris' \"I'm speaking\" moment, essentially riffing on those two words for an entire minute. Later in the sketch, Carrey's Biden transforms into a fly and lands on Pence's head. Remember that?\n\nIn her third consecutive ep in Oct. 2020, Rudolph interrupts Trump's NBC News town hall and attempts to ascertain what the hell is going on with the former president's ASL interpreter. \"I gotta get out of here, 'cause this is some spooky-ass Jordan Peele nonsense.\" Then, after a brief appearance in the 2020 Halloween episode, Rudolph returned after Biden and Harris defeated Trump in the election, playing the Vice President-elect with a renewed hunger for meme-able moments.\n\nIn the final ep of 2020, Rudolph played Harris once more in a sketch in which Bennett's Pence receives the COVID-19 vaccine. At one point, she slaps Pence for suggesting the results of the election could be overturned, and insists, \"I will make sure that Joe never specifies what he means by 'diverse.' That is my Christmas present to you, America.\" She also shuts down Biden's attempt to bring Kwanza into the conversation.\n\nRudolph's most recent appearance as Harris came on March 27, 2021, when she hosted SNL for the second time. The sketch saw the Vice President talking dirty with her husband Doug Emhoff (played by Martin Short) before hosting a star-studded Passover seder, welcoming Ted Cruz (Aidy Bryant), Ella Emhoff (Chloe Fineman), Raphael Warnock (Kenan Thompson), Joe Biden (Alex Moffat), and Marjorie Taylor Green (Cecily Strong). In a cheeky moment of unintentional foreshadowing, Harris says that just being VP \"won't be enough.\" Rudolph won a second Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for the episode.",

It goes without saying that the Bridesmaids cast member's portrayal of the former California senator has become quite popular. The actress - who's won two Emmys for her guest-hosting stints on SNL - does indeed nail the role. You can check out one of her performances down below:\n\nIt's likely that when the Bless the Harts alum - who was an SNL Season 49 host - appears as Kamala Harris this season, she'll be acting alongside current cast member James Austin Johnson. At this time, Johnson is the show's go-to actor for Donald Trump and has been praised for his work as well. Surely, fans will be delighted to see the two funny stars share the stage at 30 Rock. There is still, however, that matter of the aforementioned streaming show.\n\nAccording to Deadline, filming on the third season of Loot was set to begin on August 26. However, now that its lead actress and EP has another professional commitment, pre-production has been put on ice for the time being. The trade reports that cast and crew members were informed of the schedule shift this past week. While fans can take comfort in the fact that the upcoming season will still happen, it may be disappointing for some to know that it's being delayed.\n\nLoot sees Maya Rudolph play the role of Molly Wells, who ends up a billionaire after divorcing her wealthy husband of 20 years. With that, Molly seeks to run the charitable foundation she forgot she'd launched. The comedy series' ensemble also includes actors like Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, Joel Kim Booster, Nat Faxon and Ron Funches. The show, which premiered in 2022 and returned for its second season earlier this year, has received positive reviews, and Rudolph is currently a 2024 Emmy nominee, thanks to her performance.\n\nThis SNL news represents a relatively bittersweet turn of events. On the one hand, fans will get to see more of Maya Rudolph's winning performance as Kamala Harris. But, on the other hand, the wait for the third season of Rudolph's underrated show just became a bit longer. I suppose the public should just be grateful, though, that they're getting the actress and comedian in one form or another. Let's hope she makes a serious splash later this year, when she returns to the series that made her a star.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_swann@cinemablend.com", "name": "Erik Swann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loot (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maya Rudolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Austin_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Austin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bless_the_Harts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bless the Harts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaela_Ja\u00e9_Rodriguez", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kim_Booster", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Kim Booster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Funches", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Funches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Faxon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nat Faxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAQirAsJ5BgUD7iwkVypna-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779520", "eventUri": "eng-9779520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 1784, "textEnd": 1793}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, former President Bill Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and former President Barack Obama have endorsed Harris.\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,\" the 59-year-old said in her official statement last week. \"And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead.

She has played Harris on numerous occasions in the past, and also boasts more of a physical similarity to the politician than any other cast member, past or present. (Deadline first reported Rudolph's likely return.)\n\nDoes this return mean that Rudolph will play Kamala in the event she ends up becoming the first female President? That is most likely to be determined, as Maya has other responsibilities, including another season of her Apple TV+ comedy Loot. (Some of this may depend on how much SNL is really going to be doing spoofs of Harris at a certain point.) Also, there is a precedent for these roles being eventually handed over to current cast members over time. In the end, though, bringing on someone like Rudolph makes perfect sense to help get season 50 off to the strongest start possible, and she could easily pop in for some other sketches here and there.\n\nThere is no official premiere date yet for the landmark season 50, but we anticipate it back either in late September or early October. The next most-coveted role is obviously going to be the Vice President, though the cast member or celebrity selected will obviously depend on the choice. Given that the show already has an in-house Donald Trump at this point in James Austin Johnson, we have a hard time thinking that this is going to change.\n\nRelated - See more of our expectations entering Saturday Night Live this fall\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThe next season of \"SNL\" will begin Sept. 28, with longtime cast members Keenan Thompson, Michael Che, Mikey Day and Colin Jost returning, as well as breakout star Bowen Yang, a four-time Emmy nominee for his work on \"SNL.\" No cast members from the previous season announced they would be leaving after the season 49 finale in May, bucking a trend of a major exodus of cast members in recent years.\n\n\"SNL\" relied on a handful of cast members and guest actors to play Biden over the course of his presidency, including actor Jim Carrey, former cast member Alex Moffat, and cast members Mikey Day and James Austin Johnson. The show also featured multiple actors in the role of former President Donald Trump, including Alec Baldwin and Austin Johnson.\n\nAfter a stint in improv comedy, Rudolph joined \"SNL\" as a featured cast member in 2000, and remained on the show through 2007. Rudolph gained recognition as a talented impressionist on SNL, imitating the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce, as well as for recurring segments, such as her New York City talk show \"Bronx Beat\" with Amy Poehler -- Rudolph debuted her Harris impression only after she left the show and returned in guest roles.. Since leaving the show, Rudolph has starred in a string of comedies, including 2011's \"Grown Ups\" and 2014's \"Inherent Vice.\" She has returned to host SNL three times.\n\nSince its debut in 1975, \"SNL\" has played into political comedy, often as a voice of satire, though critics on the right have long criticized the show for what they claim is a leftward lean. The show has repeatedly mocked presidents, including Dana Carvey as former President George H.W. Bush, Darrell Hammond as former President Bill Clinton, Will Ferrell as former President George W. Bush and Fred Armisen as former President Barack Obama. Rudolph also follows a long line of actors and former cast members to play major figures in politics on the show. Former cast member Tina Fey returned in 2008 to play former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, then the Republican vice presidential nominee. During Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious appointment process in 2019, the show brought in Matt Damon to play him.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The actress stars in the series and executive produces, as well, so it makes sense that the project would need to be halted for \"scheduling reasons,\" per the outlet.\n\nAdditionally, Apple TV+'s Loot is produced by NBC sibling Universal Television -- the same company that produces Saturday Night Live. Loot was initially set to begin shooting for Season 3 on Aug 26. The outlet reports that the hit show will now resume shooting January 2025.\n\nRudolph previously took on the role of Kamala Harris in a 2019 sketch that followed her partaking in a Democratic debate. The \"Funt\" -- explained on the variety sketch show as the \"fun aunt\" -- was introduced in the cold open of the Eddie Murphy-hosted episode.\n\nThe sketch was critically acclaimed, leading to the entertainer snagging an Emmy Award for Guest Actress In a Comedy Series. Since then, Rudolph has returned to play the Oakland-born politician on numerous occasions, including in 2021, which led to another Emmy win. Saturday Night Live is set to premiere its 50th season on air September 28 -- over a month before the 2024 Presidential election in November.\n\nRudolph is up for four Emmy Awards, including Lead Actress In a Comedy Series for her role as Molly Novak in Loot.

Rudolph won an Emmy for portraying Harris during the 2020 election season and has returned to the show to play her a few times, so bringing her back was all but inevitable when Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nSaturday Night Live has been doing political comedy since its inception, but impressions used to come from inside the cast -- think Chevy Chase as Gerald Ford, Dana Carvey's George H.W. Bush, Will Ferrell's Bush Jr., etc. In recent years, the show has relied more on stunt casting for political figures. Beginning with Tina Fey's incredibly popular Sarah Palin, the biggest recurring political impressions are done by outside stars or returning SNL alums: Melissa McCarthy's Sean Spicer, Larry David's Bernie Sanders, Jim Carrey's Joe Biden, and of course, Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump, to name a few. It's a strategy that's garnered a lot of success and acclaim for the show -- Rudolph is not the only one who has won a Guest Actor Emmy for it! -- but it's too bad for the up-and-coming SNL cast members, who are now less likely to make a name on the show with a memorable political impression.

Below, the latest updates.\n\nMaya Rudolph is reportedly ready to serve ...\n\n... the country, by dusting off her Kamala Harris impression. On July 31, Deadline reported that production on Loot season three has been pushed back, giving Rudolph time to contribute to the meme-ification of the vice president on SNL for the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election. Neither Rudolph nor SNL have directly confirmed the news, but it feels inevitable. Missing the opportunity to get her back would be (coco)nuts.\n\nWe're getting a three-hour special.\n\nIn May, NBC announced that it would celebrate the show's anniversary with a primetime special on February 16, airing from 8 to 11 p.m. ET. Per The Hollywood Reporter, the network said the three-hour event would cap a \"celebratory weekend\" in SNL's honor.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_zhan@vulture.com", "name": "Jennifer Zhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Michaels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lorne Michaels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maya Rudolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a0b/6d4/d815dfe3ddc7e30a484eb2060878c614ed-kamalamaya.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779520", "eventUri": "eng-9779520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-28", "textStart": 433, "textEnd": 445}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 670, "textEnd": 677}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-16", "textStart": 1177, "textEnd": 1188}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Rudolph was a permanent fixture on the show for seven years before leaving in 2007, and establishing herself as a Hollywood star after using Saturday Night Live as a stepping stone to bigger things.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly in 2021, Rudolph said she \"smelled it coming\" before Saturday Night Live asked her to play Harris, and explained why it was a privilege to be cast in the role. \"I remember when Tina smelled it coming for Sarah Palin. It's funny. It was almost like a red herring early on, when I wasn't on the show anymore and Rachel Dolezal was in the news and everyone was talking about it I was like, 'I'm going to get the call.' It felt like that, but much more rewarding,\" she explained.\n\nRudolph also highlighted the cultural importance of the \"political portion\" of Saturday Night Live, especially during an election, adding, \"It's rare to be involved in a presidential campaign.... I think knowing that there was a candidate that I resembled so much was so cool in and of itself. And then icing on the cake is just simply getting to do it on the show, a place that I feel so at home in, and that I love.\"\n\nThe 50th season of Saturday Night Live is set to begin on September 28th, allowing the programme to satirise the presidential campaign before the election takes place on November 5th.\n\nAdditionally, the upcoming Saturday Night Live movie, has finally been given the title, Saturday Night, and is set for release on October 11th.\n\nThe release date coincides with the 49th-anniversary of the first episode of the sketch show being aired on NBC in 1975, which is appropriate as the movie documents how the programme came to fruition, and the making of the debut broadcast.\n\nAn official synopsis for the movie states that it's \"based on the true story of what happened behind the scenes in the 90 minutes leading up to the first broadcast of Saturday Night Live.\" It also promises to be \"full of humor, chaos and the magic of a revolution that almost wasn't, we count down the minutes in real time to the famous words: 'Live from New York, it's Saturday night!'\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Rudolph", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maya Rudolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sketch comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Carrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Palin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/07/Maya-Rudolph-Kamala-Harris-SNL-Far-Out-Magazine-F.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779520", "eventUri": "eng-9779520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-28", "textStart": 1729, "textEnd": 1743}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1841, "textEnd": 1853}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-11", "textStart": 1986, "textEnd": 1998}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

According to Deadline, the cast and crew were informed that production, which was scheduled to begin on Aug. 26, has been delayed for scheduling reasons.\n\nThe highly anticipated 50th season of SNL is set to premiere on Sept. 28. Rudolph's portrayal of Harris first gained popularity during the Dec. 21, 2019 episode, hosted by Eddie Murphy.\n\nHer performance was so well-received that she won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2020. She has since reprised the role several times, including during her March 2021 hosting stint, which earned her another Emmy in the same category.\n\nIn other news, on Tuesday, Harris received a boost in support with a performance by Megan Thee Stallion at a rally at Georgia State University's Convocation Center in Atlanta.\n\nThe rapper, accompanied by backup dancers dressed in blue, performed hits such as \"Girls in the Hood\" and \"Savage.\" Quavo also made an appearance to show his support, praising Harris for her dedication to the culture and ending his speech with a heartfelt reference to his late nephew, Takeoff, the Migos rapper.\n\n\"It's really such an honor to be involved in any presidential race, and this one is a real doozy. So it is really an honor,\" Rudolph told ET in 2020 of playing Harris.\n\n\"I got to meet her, and she is so fantastic. She is so incredible, she is so energizing and I just feel so good to be associated with someone so positive,\" she added. \"I just want to do her proud -- just do a good job, no pressure!\"\n\n\"I definitely tried to make her fun because I do feel that when I see her. You can tell she loves life and she is real and she is honest and she has no problem speaking her mind and being forthright about it, which I think is so important right now,\" the comedian shared. \"But she is also so joyful and you see her dancing in the room and all this stuff. She is just a great human, and I forgot what it felt like to see that and to see something so positive.

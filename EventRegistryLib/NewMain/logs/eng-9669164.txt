The Stewart-Haas Racing co-owner's announcement comes weeks after SHR said it was shutting down at the end of the season. SHR currently fields Cup Series cars for Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece and Xfinity series cars for Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nThe new team will be called the Haas Factory Team. Haas also owns a Formula 1 team that currently fields cars for Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen.\n\nHaas didn't announce any driver for the 2025 season, but it's fair to assume that Custer could be a candidate for the Cup Series car. Custer previously drove in the Cup Series for SHR and his father Joe Custer is a longtime executive for Haas' racing operations and will be the new team's president.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing was formed in 2009 when Tony Stewart left Joe Gibbs Racing. As part of his move from JGR, Stewart got an ownership stake in what was previously known as Haas CNC Racing.\n\nThe team immediately moved from backmarker to serious competitor as Stewart and Ryan Newman were SHR's first drivers. Stewart won his third Cup Series title in 2011 and became the first owner-driver to win a Cup title since Alan Kulwicki in 1992.\n\nSHR won a second Cup Series title with Kevin Harvick in 2014, but has taken a step back in recent seasons. Harvick was the team's stalwart before retiring at the end of the 2023 season and SHR lost longtime sponsors like Busch and Smithfield ahead of the 2024 season.\n\nHaas' decision to keep a charter means SHR still has two charters for sale ahead of the 2025 season. Front Row Motorsports has already acquired one of SHR's charters, and the other two could be on the market for some time as NASCAR and its team owners look for an extension of their franchising model. The current charter agreement expires at the end of the 2024 season and there doesn't appear to have been much progress in negotiations between NASCAR and teams over the first half of the 2024 season.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Herbst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riley Herbst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Preece", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Preece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Haas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene Haas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Custer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Custer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Newman_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Newman (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Rosberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kulwicki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Kulwicki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithfield_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smithfield Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front Row Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7PtvC8KUC5C4CGJXcFZesg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/f1436e90-2f42-11ef-ba6f-40273dc8868b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669164", "eventUri": "eng-9669164", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

She won another bronze at the mixed team match with Sarabjot Singh, becoming the first Indian woman to bag two medals in a single Olympics event since independence.\n\nIndian shooter Manu Bhaker shot her way into history on Tuesday by becoming the first Indian woman to bag two medals in a single Olympics event since independence.\n\nBhaker secured her first medal, a bronze, at the Paris Olympics Games 2024 in the women's 10-metre air pistol event on Sunday. She scored 221.7 points, securing the bronze medal in the final. She won a second medal, a bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team match along with Sarabjot Singh on Tuesday.\n\nThese wins come after the heartbreak at Tokyo Olympics 2020 where she missed a medal due to a malfunctioning pistol.\n\nDejected and disappointed, Bhaker had even contemplated quitting the sport last year. But with the constant encouragement and support of her coach, Jaspal Rana, she overcame the disappointment and persevered, and her efforts have paid off now. Her medals in Paris also ended India's 12-year-long wait for a medal in shooting.\n\n\"Winning this medal is a dream come true, not just for me but for everyone who has supported me. I am deeply grateful to the NRAI (National Rifle Association of India), SAI (Sports Authority of India), Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Coach Jaspal Rana sir, Haryana government, and OGQ (Olympic Gold Quest). I dedicate this victory to my country for their incredible support and love,\" Bhaker posted on social media platform X.\n\nBhaker expressed that the teachings of Lord Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita were her source of support during the crucial moments of the competition.\n\n\"I read a lot of Gita, so what was going on in my mind is just do what you are meant to do and leave the rest to your destiny. In Gita, Krishna says to Arjun that you focus on your karma and not the outcome of your karma. That was going through my mind in the final moment. Just do your thing,\" she said in an interview.\n\nHailing from Jhajjar, Haryana, Bhaker was inspired by Indian boxers and wrestlers who were winning medals for the country. As a child, she took an interest in various sports such as tennis, skating, boxing, and martial arts. However, at the age of 14, she fell in love with shooting and decided to give it a shot.\n\nThe 22-year-old shooter made her international debut at the 2017 Asian Junior Championships. She then won nine gold medals at the National Shooting Championships in Kerala in 2017.\n\nAt the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup debut in Guadalajara, Mexico, she clinched a gold medal when she was just 16 years old, becoming the youngest Indian to win a gold medal in the history of the event. She went on to bag several gold medals at the ISSF Junior World Cup, both in individual and mixed team events.\n\nBhaker, a graduate from Delhi's Lady Shriram College, also won the 10m air pistol gold at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, Argentina, becoming the first Indian shooter and the first female athlete from the country to win a gold medal at the Youth Olympics.\n\nAfter the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Bhaker went on to become the junior world champion in the women's 10m air pistol category at Lima. Since then, she has regularly won medals in the junior circuit.\n\nBhaker is the only athlete from the 21-member Indian shooting team to participate in multiple individual events at the Paris Olympics.\n\nFollowing her win in Paris, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the athlete on X.\n\n\"Our shooters continue to make us proud! Congratulations to @realmanubhaker and Sarabjot Singh for winning the Bronze medal in the 10m Air Pistol Mixed Team event at the #Olympics. Both of them have shown great skills and teamwork. India is incredibly delighted. For Bhaker, this is her second consecutive Olympic medal, showcasing her consistent excellence and dedication. #Cheer4Bharat,\" he wrote.\n\nThe head coach of the men's Indian cricket team Gautam Gambhir, actresses Deepika Padukone and Shilpa Shetty, and many officials, sport stars, and celebrities have also congratulated the Indian shooter, whose rise to Olympic stardom is the perfect story of hope and resilience.\n\nFor someone who wanted to leave the sport, Bhaker has indeed come a long way. The Olympic medal is the ultimate dream for most athletes, and Bhaker has two of them in her kitty. But she's far from being done.\n\nAhead of the third Olympic event, where she will compete in the 25m sports pistol qualifications on Friday (August 2), Bhaker is committed to giving her best shot.\n\n\"I hope the support continues. I will definitely try my best and hope people are not disappointed or angry,\" she said, as quoted by PTI.", "source": {"uri": "yourstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "yourstory.com"},

With this Bhaker became the only athlete from independent India to bag two medals in a single edition of the Olympics, as she earlier won a bronze medal in the 10m air pistol women's final. However, there's another record that has been created by the duo with this bronze medal.\n\nIn 1928, India's hockey team started its Olympic journey and hasn't looked back since then. So far, they have won 12 medals at the Olympics, including eight gold medals. The hockey team waited for 96 years to see another Indian team getting a medal at the Olympics and their wait came to an end on Tuesday when Bhaker and Sarabjot bagged the bronze.\n\nEarlier in 1952, wrestler KD Jadhav became India's first individual medalist (bronze) and gave company to the hockey team. But, Bhaker and Sarabjot became the first team to bag a medal at the Olympics.\n\nTalking about Bhaker and Sarabjot, the Indian pair defeated the Korean duo of Lee Wonoho and Oh Yeh Jin 16-10 to earn the country its second medal at Chateauroux's shooting range.\n\nThe 22-year-old Bhaker had earlier snared the women's 10m air pistol bronze medal at the same venue on Sunday, wiping off the memories of a horrendous Olympic debut in Tokyo 2020 where her pistol malfunctioned leaving her in tears.\n\nBefore her, British-Indian athlete Norman Pritchard had won two silver medals in 200m sprint and 200m hurdles at the 1900 Olympics but that achievement had come in the pre-Independence era.\n\nWhile it is a massive achievement for women's sport in the country, Tuesday's medal is also redemption for Sarabjot, who had failed to make the men's 10m air pistol final, finishing ninth on Saturday with a score of 577.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Bhaker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manu Bhaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSF_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ISSF World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norman Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/j8o97a5_bhaker-and-hockey_625x300_31_July_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778206", "eventUri": "eng-9778206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

AFP\n\nIndian shooters Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh secured a bronze medal in the 10m Air Pistol Mixed Team event at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The duo showcased resilience and composure, overcoming a slow start to defeat South Korea 16-10 in a thrilling match on Tuesday.\n\nThe contest began with the Indian pair on the back foot, losing the first series. However, Bhaker and Singh quickly regained their footing, displaying exceptional skill and teamwork. They took control by the third series, leading 4-2, and extended their advantage to 8-2 after five series. South Korea mounted a comeback attempt, narrowing the gap to 6-10 by the eighth series, but Bhaker and Singh remained unflinching. The Indian shooters sealed the victory with a decisive 16-10 margin, securing India's second medal of the Games.\n\nSerbia's Zorana Arunovic and Damir Mikec claimed the gold while silver was won by Ilayda Tarhan and Yusef Dikec of Turkey.\n\nAfter the match, an elated Bhaker expressed her gratitude, saying, \"I feel really proud and have a lot of gratitude. Thank you so much for all the blessings and love. We can only control what is in our hands. I had a chat with my father regarding this before coming here and decided we should keep fighting till the last shot,\" said to the broadcasters.\n\nManu became the second Indian woman to win two Olympic medals after shuttler PV Sandhu, who clinched consecutive medals in the 2016 (silver) and 2020 (bronze) Olympics.\n\nManu still has the 25m pistol event left to compete in, where she will compete alongside Esha Singh, giving her a chance to win a hat-trick of medals in Paris. With several records broken, this accomplishment represents a critical turning point in Indian sports history.\n\nSarabjot Singh, celebrating his first Olympic medal, echoed her sentiments. \"It feels great. The game was tough, but we were glad we could do it. There was a lot of pressure, but the crowd was great,\" he said, acknowledging the support that spurred them on. The pair had entered the bronze medal match after finishing third in the qualifying round with a combined score of 580.\n\nThis bronze is a historic personal achievement for Bhaker, who became the first Indian to win multiple medals at a single Olympic Games. She had previously opened India's medal account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol event.\n\nMeanwhile, after Singh's historic bronze medal win, the shooter's coach Abhishek Rana has revealed that was confident because his ward has always returned with a medal from every event he participated in.\n\n\"I have been with Sarabjot since day one. It is a matter of great happiness for me that we won the bronze medal today. We have participated in numerous national and international tournaments, and Sarabjot has never returned empty-handed from any event,\" Rana said.\n\nLast year, Sarabjot won gold in the 10m Air Pistol Men's team event and silver in the Mixed Team in the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. He also won multiple medals on the international stage across junior and senior levels.\n\nHe has won a bronze medal in the 10m Air Pistol Individual event along with Olympics 2024 quota place for the country at the 2023 Asian Championship in Korea, a gold medal in the Individual event at the 2023 World Cup in Bhopal and gold in the Mixed Team event at the 2023 World Cup in Baku.\n\nSarabjot also won one gold in the Team event and two silver medals in the Individual and Mixed Yeam competition at the 2022 Junior World Cup in Suhl, Germany, before winning two gold medals in the Team & Mixed Team events at the 2021 Junior World Championship in Lima, Peru.\n\n\"We began training in 2016, and in 2017, Sarabjot won his first medal, a bronze, at the nationals. After that, he won 5-6 medals consecutively at the nationals. In 2019, he became the Junior World Champion and continued to win medals consistently. Till today the journey has been fascinating,\" said Rana.\n\nThe 22-year-old, Sarabjot, who was playing his maiden Olympics, is now the sixth Indian shooter to win a medal at the Summer Games.",

She secured bronze in the 10m Air Pistol individual event on July 28 and, alongside Sarabjot Singh, won another bronze in the 10m Air Pistol mixed event on July 30. As she prepares for her third and final event in the 25m sports pistol qualifications on August 2, Bhaker expressed hope that fans would not be disappointed if she doesn't win another medal.\n\nManu Bhaker will aim for a hat-trick of medals in the women's 25m pistol event, where she is among the medal favourites. However, she understands the unpredictability that comes with competing at the highest level.\n\nALSO ON ABP Live | When Is PV Sindhu's Next Match At Paris Olympics 2024?

She said she will be committed to doing her best but also asked fans not to be disappointed or angry if she doesn't win another medal, despite her historic achievements at the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"I hope the love stays.

With one event remaining in the 25m sports pistol, she expressed gratitude for her achievements so far and looked forward to her final competition. Bhaker also expressed that her journey will continue regardless of wins or losses.\n\n\"The feeling is surreal because I had not hoped I would win two medals in a single Olympics. There is one more match to go (in 25m sports pistol). So, I am looking forward to the next one, but I am grateful that I got another medal for India,\" Manu said further.\n\n\"I can't say that about myself (becoming a female sporting icon); if people call me that then I am grateful.

This was to be expected, as Ireland were the easiest opponents in this group.\n\nIndia were unconvincing in the second half, but the win means they are now on seven points from three games, with the defeat eliminating Ireland from the quarter-finals.\n\nEarlier in the day, a calm and collected Manu Bhaker made history by becoming the first Indian athlete in the post-independence era to win two Olympic medals in a single edition of the Games. Partnering the equally calm Sarabjot Singh, she claimed bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team event on Tuesday.\n\nThe Indian duo defeated Korean duo Lee Wonoho and Oh Yeh Jin 16-10 to secure the country's second medal at the Chateauroux shooting range.\n\nEarlier on Sunday at the same venue, the 22-year-old Bhaker won the bronze medal in the women's 10m air pistol, erasing the horrible memories of her terrible Olympic debut in Tokyo 2020.\n\nBefore her, British-Indian athlete Norman Pritchard had won two silver medals in the 200-metre sprint and 200-metre hurdles at the 1900 Olympics. However, this achievement was achieved in the pre-independence period.\n\nWhile it is a huge achievement for women's sport in the country, the medal is also a redemption for Sarabjot, who failed to reach the final of the men's 10m air pistol, finishing ninth on Saturday with a score of 577.\n\n\"I am extremely proud and grateful, thank you for all the blessings,\" Bhaker said after the match, which the two young Indians played with remarkable composure and made it a one-sided contest.\n\n\"We actually have no control (over what our rivals do), we can do what we can. My partner and I thought, let's just do our best and keep fighting till the end,\" said Bhaker, who failed to even qualify for the event at the Tokyo Games, along with Saurabh Chaudhary, finishing seventh.\n\nAmbala shooter Sarabjot, who was going through a tough phase trying to come to terms with the disappointment of the individual event three days ago, said he was under immense pressure to perform.\n\n\"I feel good, it was a tough match and there was a lot of pressure, I am very happy,\" said the 22-year-old Sarabjot, who comes from a farming family.\n\nThe Indians started badly with Sarabjot's opening shot yielding a meagre 8.6 while Bhaker shot 10.2 for a total of 18.8. The Koreans totalled 20.5 to win the opening round and take a 2-0 lead.\n\nIn mixed team events, the first pair to score 16 points wins the medal.\n\nWhen they were 0-2 down, Bhaker's consistency came to the fore and rubbed off on Sarabjot, as the duo won the next four rounds to take their score to 8-2.\n\nBhaker had only three strokes under 10 in the entire match that lasted 13 rounds.\n\nIt was a tough task for the Koreans, who buckled under pressure and were no match for their rivals, losing 16-10.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

Competing in three events -- 10m air pistol women's, 10m air pistol mixed team and 25m pistol women's -- Bhaker has won a bronze medal in both 10m events, combining with her Haryanvi teammate Sarabjot Singh in the mixed team event.\n\nIn doing so, she becomes the first athlete of independent India to win two medals at a single edition of the Olympics. (The last one to do so was Norman Pritchard way back in 1900, incidentally also in Paris Games.)\n\nThree years after a poor showing in Tokyo, where the 18-year-old was heavily scrutinised for her performance, Bhaker has bounced back and how. In an interview to India Today TV after her first medal, she recalled the difficult time in the aftermath of the 2020 Games. \"I was dejected after Tokyo. I was unable to understand what I did wrong, what I didn't do and what I want to do next. I was in the team but I wasn't happy from within,\" she said. Bhaker staged a comeback by showing tremendous maturity and a renewed purpose for a sport she picked up when she was 16.\n\nIt all changed in 2023 when Bhaker took the initiative and reached out to her erstwhile coach, Jaspal Rana, with whom she had an acrimonious split before the Tokyo Games, realising that the former coach of India's junior team knew what it took to get the best out of her. Rana told her that \"she is not just one of the best shooters in the country but also in the world\", and that she needs to put the past behind and work towards her goal.\n\n\"He gave me faith and my confidence returned,\" says Bhaker. The coming together of the guru-shishya has yielded rich dividends, with Bhaker topping the national trials in both 10m air pistol and 25m pistol, which ensured her ticket to Paris.\n\nWhen prodded on what's changed in her regimen, Bhaker cited reading the Bhagavad Gita as uplifting. \"I am amazed how relevant it is even in today's time and how we can apply its learnings,\" she says, talking of how life has taken a spiritual turn. Bhaker did so on the range too as she focused on her \"karma\", and didn't bother looking at the screen to keep abreast with the scores. Meditation and improved sleep quality helped her improve focus.\n\n\"I cannot express what the medal means to me, but it has been a long dream of mine to win an Olympic medal for India albeit it has been to win a gold medal,\" she said. \"The dream is still alive.\"\n\nThose who have observed Bhaker in Chateauroux say that she's in a different zone altogether and her confidence cannot be overlooked. With one more event to go -- 25m pistol on August 2 -- she clearly isn't done with making history.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Bhaker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manu Bhaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSF_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ISSF World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaspal_Rana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaspal Rana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norman Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryanvi_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryanvi language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e2teauroux", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teauroux"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e2teauroux"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India Today (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhagavad Gita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meditation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/olympics-2024-313427491-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=tWBHkABsWEyNC0mwLmiNn6LKH_QiO.MU", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778206", "eventUri": "eng-9778206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 2696, "textEnd": 2704}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Her historic achievement also ended the country's 12-year Olympic shooting medal drought.\n\nContinuing her excellent performance, Bhaker, alongside Sarabjot Singh, won another bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team event on Tuesday, defeating Korea 16-10.\n\nBhaker's historic accomplishments at the Paris Games make her the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals in a single edition. She is also the fourth Indian athlete overall to win two medals at the Olympics, after Norman Pritchard, Sushil Kumar, and PV Sindhu.\n\nWith Bhaker also participating in the 25-metre air pistol event, the 22-year-old athlete can make further history by becoming the first Indian to win three medals in a single Olympic edition.\n\nAccording to Deccan Herald, Asianet News, and publicly available data, Bhaker's estimated net worth is Rs 12 crore as of 2024. She has built her wealth largely through her earnings as a shooter and endorsements from brands like Performax and Nothing India. According to MoneyControl, female athletes in India charge between Rs 8 lakh and 30 lakh for endorsements, and Bhaker's brand value is reported to be around Rs 1.5 crore.\n\nWinning an Olympic medal, whether gold, silver, or bronze, doesn't come with direct financial rewards from the International Olympic Committee. However, athletes often receive prize money and other incentives from their home countries or state governments. Bhaker, who has a history of international success, including a gold medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, may have received financial rewards for her achievements in the past, though specific details are not known.\n\n\"We are getting a lot of queries which started yesterday and now these enquiries have doubled.

The 22-year-old opened India's medal tally at the Games with a third-place finish at the 10m Air Pistol event on Sunday, becoming the first woman shooter to win an Olympic medal. She also ended the 12-year-old draught of an Olympic medal in shooting for India.\n\nBut she didn't just stop there. The next day she qualified for the bronze medal match in the 10m Air Pistol mixed team event, with Sarabjot Singh and went on to clinch another bronze on Tuesday. She thus became the first-ever athlete in independent India to win two medals in a single edition of the Olympic Games.\n\nParis Olympics 2024 Day 5 Live Updates\n\nSocial media has been buzzing with appreciation posts and congratulatory messages for Bhaker. Meanwhile, Star Sport shared a 4-year-old video of her in which she explained how she made her way to shooting.\n\n\"I've always been good at athletics. 100m, 200m, 400m relay, and even Kho-Kho... I loved the sport. I was very fond of Kabaddi. So many clothes of mine tore while playing Kabaddi. But my favourite sport has been martial arts and skating; both normal or ice skating,\" Bhaker told Star Sports back in 2020.\n\n\"So, after trying hands at different sports I got into shooting. I just thought 'I'll try this as well'. So I started this because it's such a clean sport.\n\n\"You have to be very patient and calm in sport. This was a bit challenging but I love it now,\" she added.\n\nIndia's Full Schedule at Paris Olympics 2024 For July 31\n\nBhaker further revealed that people around her during a train journey mistook shooting for filming movies.\n\n\"Once I was travelling on a train and people around me asked me what I do. I said, 'Main shooting karti hoon'. And then asked, 'Kaun se film ki shooting kar rahe ho?'. Then I explained that shooting is a sport where we use guns to shoot a target. They said, 'Okay, don't shoot us please',\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aakash_biswas@news18.com", "name": "Aakash Biswas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Bhaker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manu Bhaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shooting sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2018_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Mixed_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2018 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Mixed team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kabaddi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (hull)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Sports_(Indian_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Sports (Indian TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kho_kho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kho kho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice skating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Range_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Range Facilities", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/manu-bhaker-competing-in-10m-air-rifle-mixed-team-event-2024-07-c28fcc74a195334017040d159ed54cfc-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778206", "eventUri": "eng-9778206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1701}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

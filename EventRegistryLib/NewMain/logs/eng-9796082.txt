She was 70.\n\nLos Angeles native Yasutake, born and raised in Gardena and Inglewood, graduated from UCLA with honors in Theater. She started her career at East West Players, where she worked with the company's co-founder, Japanese-American acting icon Mako for six years onstage, on staff and on the board, performing in over a dozen shows.\n\nYasutake's last TV role before her death was one of the highest-profiled ones in her career -- she was a series regular on Netflix acclaimed limited series Beef, playing George's mother Fumi Nakai. Yasutake also is known for playing Nurse Alyssa Ogawa on Star Trek: The Next Generation, a role she later reprised in the films Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek Generations.\n\n\"Patti was my first client when I began over thirty years ago,\" Fritz said. \"We enjoyed every day we got to work together, and I will miss her spirit talent and tenacity but most of all her friendship.\"\n\nYasutake made her major feature debut in Ron Howard's 1986 comedy Gung Go as Umeki, a relocated Japanese wife earnestly trying to Americanize. She reprised her character in the followup ABC comedy series spawned by the movie.\n\nFor her next movie, the 1988 The Wash, Yasutake received an Independent Spirit Award Supporting Actress nomination. Her resume also includes the films Drop Dead Gorgeous, Blind Spot and Road to Galveston and a slew of guest starring appearances on such series as The Closer, Grey's Anatomy, Bones, Flash Forward, The Unit and Cold Case.\n\nSpanning three decades, Yasutake's theater work included stints at New Mexico Repertory Theatre, American Southwest Theatre, Los Angeles Theatre Center, San Diego Repertory Theatre, Manhattan Theatre Club, South Coast Repertory Theatre and The Westwood Playhouse (now The Geffen Playhouse).\n\nAs a theater director, she developed and staged world premieres at East West Players (Doughball), the Richmond Shepherd Theater (The Single Man), and Ensemble Studio Theater (Father, I Must Have Rice), along with a revival of Tea at the Odyssey Theater.\n\nYasutake was preceded in death by her parents, Michael and Jean Yasutake and her sister, business executive Irene Hirano Inouye. She is survived by siblings Linda Hayashi and Steven Yasutake, a large extended family of nephews and nieces, and a family of friends and colleagues including Fritz and Jonathan Del Arco.\n\nA memorial will be held at East West Players. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that a contribution be made to the theater company.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She began acting with East West Players & had a successful career in TV, film, and stage. Yasutake recently starred on the acclaimed Netflix series Beef.\n\nPatti Yasutake, known for her roles on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Beef, has died of cancer. News of Yasutake's passing was reported to Deadline by Yasutake's longtime friend and agent, Kyle Fritz. Yasutake as 70.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles on September 6, 1953, Yasutake graduated with honors from UCLA's theater program, and began acting with the East West Players, an Asian-American theater group co-founded by, among others, veteran actors Mako and James Hong. She made her TV debut on a 1985 episode of the William Shatner cop show T.J. Hooker, and hit the big screen a year later in the Michael Keaton comedy Gung Ho, playing the wife of Japanese auto plant manager Gedde Watanabe. Both Yasutake and Watanabe returned for the short-lived TV version of the movie. In 1988, she starred alongside Mako in the film The Wash; her performance was well-received, and she was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award.\n\nWho Is Nurse Alyssa Ogawa?\n\nOne of Yasutake's best-known roles came about in 1990, when she was cast as a Starfleet nurse on \"Future Imperfect\", a fourth-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Typically used to give Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) a sounding board, the character proved popular, and was soon given a name, Alyssa Ogawa; she ultimately appeared in sixteen episodes of the show's last four seasons. In the seventh season, she was spotlighted on the episode \"Lower Decks\", and was part of a multi-episode subplot about her romance and eventual marriage to a fellow crew member, and her subsequent pregnancy. Yasutake reprised the role in two movies with the Next Generation cast; 1994's Star Trek: Generations and 1996's Star Trek: First Contact. She also appeared in-character as Ogawa in a 1993 TV commercial for Hallmark's USS Enterprise Christmas ornament.\n\nYasutake made a number of TV guest appearances; series she guested on include Grey's Anatomy, The Closer, Boston Legal, and NCIS: Los Angeles. She also appeared in a number of films, including Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, Drop Dead Gorgeous, and the Star Trek parody Unbelievable!!!!! alongside a number of other Star Trek alumni. Recently, Yasutake had a prominent role on Netflix's acclaimed miniseries Beef, starring as Fumi Nakai, the passive-aggressive mother-in-law of Amy (Ali Wong). She was also a prominent stage actor and director.\n\nYasutake died peacefully at her home, surrounded by family and friends. She is survived by two siblings, Linda Hayashi and Steven Yasutake, and by many nieces and nephews.", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Yasutake", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patti Yasutake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek: The Next Generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beef (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West_Players", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East West Players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedde_Watanabe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gedde Watanabe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mako_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mako (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gung_Ho_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gung Ho (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Imperfect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Future Imperfect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_McFadden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gates McFadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Hooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

She liked my black trilby I was wearing so I gave it to her as present and she wore for the rest of the convention.

What a legend.\"\n\nA California native, Yasutake grew up in Gardena and Inglewood and was a proud alumnus of UCLA's theatre programme where she graduated with honours.

Yasutake appeared in 16 episodes, often in scenes opposite Gates McFadden's Dr. Beverly Crusher. Nurse Ogawa has the rare distinction of appearing in a 1993 Hallmark commercial for an Enterprise Christmas ornament, and over the years, the character endeared itself to Trekkers of all stripes. Her popularity on the series eventually led to the beloved season seven episode \"Lower Decks,\" which explored the oft-mention, rarely seen members of the Enterprise crew and romance subplot for the nurse. Yasutake continued to reprise the role throughout the '90s, appearing in the films Star Trek: Generations and Star Trek: First Contact.\n\nIn 2023, the actor experienced a late-career breakout on the Netflix original Beef. Starring as Fumi, the eccentric mother-in-law of Ali Wong's Amy, Yasutake delighted in a script that \"really, really, really spoke to the Asian American experience, and yet it wasn't necessarily about that.\" Yasutake didn't take the role lightly. \"I was just elated, this many decades into my career, that a role like this would come along,\" she told Netflix last year. \"She's fierce, and she's unapologetic, so I just adore her. Because she's also very wicked, in some ways, but she also has a great heart.\"\n\nBorn on September 6, 1953, Yasutake was a Los Angeles original, raised in Gardena and Inglewood. She graduated with honors in theater from UCLA before joining the East West Players, the nation's longest-running Asian American theater, where she also directed. She spent 30 years in the theater as an actor and director, working with New Mexico Repertory Theatre, American Southwest Theatre, Los Angeles Theatre Center, San Diego Repertory Theatre, Manhattan Theatre Club, South Coast Repertory Theatre, The Westwood Playhouse (now The Geffen Playhouse).\n\nYatusake, a prolific television actor, who said TV and commercials paid for her theater career, made her small screen debut in 1985 on an episode of T.J. Hooker before making her way to Knots Landing. She crossed over to movies with Ron Howard's Gung Ho and appeared on the short-lived ABC series it inspired. But her big break came via a 1988 indie by Michael Toshiyuki Uno called The Wash, a film about a second-generation Japanese American couple in the throes of separation. For the performance, Yatusake nabbed an Independent Spirit nomination for Best Supporting Female.\n\nShe worked frequently on television throughout her career, appearing on Mr. Belvedere, Picket Fences, ER, Judging Amy, Grey's Anatomy, Bones, Boston Legal, NCIS: Los Angeles, and Pretty Little Liars. Yasukate also appeared in the films Drop Dead Gorgeous, Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot!, and Clockwatchers.\n\nShe is survived by Linda Hayashi and Steven Yasutake and her extended family.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Especially back then, that's all they saw you as.\"\n\nNotable film credits include Drop Dead Gorgeous and The Wash, the latter of which earned her a Best Supporting Female nomination at the Film Independent Spirit Awards in 1989. Other TV credits include Grey's Anatomy, Cold Case, Bones, the Young and the Restless, NCIS: Los Angeles, The Closer, and Pretty Little Liars.\n\nWant more movie news?

She played the domineering mother of Joseph Lee's George who finds herself wrapped up in her daughter-in-law's (played by Ali Wong) escalating feud with a down-on-his-luck contractor (Steven Yeun).\n\n\"It was like the clouds parted and the sun came through,\" she told Tudum of her first read of the script. \"I was just elated, this many decades into my career, that a role like this would come along.\"\n\nYasutake is survived by siblings Linda Hayashi and Steven Yasutake and a large extended family of nephews and nieces.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian-American_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian-American theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West_Players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East West Players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Spirit_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Female", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mako_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mako (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Spirit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent Spirit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grey's Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beef (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Little_Liars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pretty Little Liars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Case", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold Case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bones (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Yeun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Yeun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Closer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Closer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_criticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film criticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCIS (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/mYhHxQfzpsPJfPxYDdUSCeKgP1E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patti-yasutake-080624-4de3dac2387946249d99b63c86a1d982.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796082", "eventUri": "eng-9796082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

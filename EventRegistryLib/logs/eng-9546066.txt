(Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)\n\nIowa's public universities are proposing smaller tuition increases than in past years for this fall as they balance savings from a slight increase in state allocations and other efforts with impacts from inflation, recruiting and retaining talent and providing more opportunities for students.\n\nProposed tuition rates for state universities would have undergraduate resident students paying 3% more at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and 2% more at the University of Northern Iowa, according to Iowa Board of Regent documents.\n\nPeople are also reading...

UNI would raise its nonresident tuition by 2% and ISU's nonresident tuition would increase by 4.5%.\n\nThe rising prices would bring UI tuition to $9,286 for residents and $31,374 for nonresidents, ISU tuition to $9,252 for residents and $27,346 for nonresidents and UNI tuition to $8,564 for residents and $20,340 for nonresidents.\n\nThe board will discuss the tuition rates at its meeting Friday, with final action slated for June.\n\n\"Funding from the proposed tuition increases will help address growing financial challenges including inflationary cost increases, recruiting and retaining faculty and staff in national markets, meeting collective bargaining terms, deferred maintenance needs in academic facilities, and student financial aid to provide higher education opportunities to more students,\" the document stated.\n\nThese increases are smaller than the tuition hikes approved over the past two years, with prices for in-state undergrads at all three universities going up by 3.25% in 2023 and 4.25% in 2022. According to the board of regents document, the universities considered the 2.5% increase in state funding they will receive in fiscal year 2025, pending Gov. Kim Reynolds' signature, as well as potential operating cost savings through \"efficiencies and reallocations\" and impacts of inflation on budgets when developing their proposed tuition increases.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report cited in the board of regents document, the core inflation rate in the 12-month period ending in March was 3.8%.\n\nMandatory fees for students will also increase at each of the universities, by 1.3% to $1,534 at ISU, by 2.5% to $1,997 at the UI and by 3% to $1,372 at UNI.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPotential increases for graduate student tuition vary across the colleges, with UNI and ISU raising rates for both resident and nonresident students by 2% and 4.5%, respectively, and the UI upping tuition for in-state students by 3.5% and nonresident students by 1.3%.\n\nGraduate students would also see mandatory fee increases -- a 1.4% raise to $1,474 at ISU, a 2.5% raise to $2,004 at the UI and a 3% raise to $1,372 at UNI.\n\n\"The proposed tuition rates at all three universities combined are projected to generate $35 million in incremental revenue for FY 2025, approximately 1.9% of the current total general education fund operating budget,\" the document stated.\n\nThe universities will request special tuition rates for certain programs, according to the board of regents document, to balance budgets and provide financial support.\n\nAt the UI, the Carver College of Medicine's Radiation Sciences Program is requesting a $1,617 tuition increase for its second year of a three-year effort to reach a balanced budget and fully fund the program. The college of medicine is also asking to keep tuition flat for Doctor of Medicine students as well as those enrolling in the Master of Science in Athletic Training and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\n\nThe UI Master of Clinical Nutrition program is requesting to keep tuition flat for nonresident students and increase tuition by 3% for resident students, and the physician's assistant program is asking for a 2.5% increase for all students. The UI College of Nursing is also requesting no increase in tuition for its students, and the College of Pharmacy is proposing a .75% increase for both resident and nonresident students.\n\nUNI will request to have \"supplemental tuition\" of $1,944 for its nursing program to handle costs of simulation and lab equipment and meet requirements for student learning and accreditation. Annual costs are expected to exceed $100,000, the document stated, with periodic additional costs of repair and replacement, and could increase over time. If approved, the tuition would match costs for students in the Wilson College of Business.\n\nISU is requesting that certain students within the Ivy School of Business have tuition increased -- $1,340 for residents and $2,476 for nonresidents -- in order to align rates for sophomore business majors with juniors and seniors. This will be the second of three years working to simplify the differential tuition rate structure, according to the document, and will align the costs for business students with those enrolled in the engineering, agricultural systems technology and industrial technology programs.\n\nThe university's veterinary medicine program is proposing a 5% tuition increase for in-state students and 3.5% increase for out-of-state students in order to support faculty and students, maintain equipment and access new technologies. The executive MBA program, geared toward senior business leaders, is also requesting a 10% increase in tuition, as its tuition hasn't changed since its inception in 2019 and funds are needed to cover costs of instruction, materials and travel.\n\nISU is also seeking to change its tuition assessment policies for graduate students in interdepartmental majors, according to the document. As the majors are offered by faculty representing a major rather than a specific department or college, tuition for them currently aligns with the faculty member's department, and the university is requesting approval to instead align it with the student's area of study.\n\n\"This proposal treats students pursuing the same degree equitably, regardless of the home department of their major professor, and will increase cost transparency for prospective students,\" the document stated. \"Additionally, the change will improve operational efficiency, align tuition rates with the cost of instruction, and support the goal of growing enrollment in interdepartmental programs.\"\n\nThe post State universities propose tuition increases to Iowa Board of Regents appeared first on Iowa Capital Dispatch.\n\nBest colleges in Iowa Best colleges in Iowa #10.

(Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)\n\nIowa's public universities are proposing smaller tuition increases than in past years for this fall as they balance savings from a slight increase in state allocations and other efforts with impacts from inflation, recruiting and retaining talent and providing more opportunities for students.\n\nProposed tuition rates for state universities would have undergraduate resident students paying 3% more at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and 2% more at the University of Northern Iowa, according to Iowa Board of Regent documents.\n\nTuition increases for nonresident undergraduate students varies between the universities, with the UI presenting the smallest increase of 1.3%. UNI would raise its nonresident tuition by 2% and ISU's nonresident tuition would increase by 4.5%.\n\nThe rising prices would bring UI tuition to $9,286 for residents and $31,374 for nonresidents, ISU tuition to $9,252 for residents and $27,346 for nonresidents and UNI tuition to $8,564 for residents and $20,340 for nonresidents.\n\nThe board will discuss the tuition rates at its meeting Friday, with final action slated for June.\n\n\"Funding from the proposed tuition increases will help address growing financial challenges including inflationary cost increases, recruiting and retaining faculty and staff in national markets, meeting collective bargaining terms, deferred maintenance needs in academic facilities, and student financial aid to provide higher education opportunities to more students,\" the document stated.\n\nThese increases are smaller than the tuition hikes approved over the past two years, with prices for in-state undergrads at all three universities going up by 3.25% in 2023 and 4.25% in 2022. According to the board of regents document, the universities considered the 2.5% increase in state funding they will receive in fiscal year 2025, pending Gov. Kim Reynolds' signature, as well as potential operating cost savings through \"efficiencies and reallocations\" and impacts of inflation on budgets when developing their proposed tuition increases.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report cited in the board of regents document, the core inflation rate in the 12-month period ending in March was 3.8%.\n\nMandatory fees for students will also increase at each of the universities, by 1.3% to $1,534 at ISU, by 2.5% to $1,997 at the UI and by 3% to $1,372 at UNI.\n\nPotential increases for graduate student tuition vary across the colleges, with UNI and ISU raising rates for both resident and nonresident students by 2% and 4.5%, respectively, and the UI upping tuition for in-state students by 3.5% and nonresident students by 1.3%.\n\nGraduate students would also see mandatory fee increases -- a 1.4% raise to $1,474 at ISU, a 2.5% raise to $2,004 at the UI and a 3% raise to $1,372 at UNI.\n\n\"The proposed tuition rates at all three universities combined are projected to generate $35 million in incremental revenue for FY 2025, approximately 1.9% of the current total general education fund operating budget,\" the document stated.\n\nThe universities will request special tuition rates for certain programs, according to the board of regents document, to balance budgets and provide financial support.\n\nAt the UI, the Carver College of Medicine's Radiation Sciences Program is requesting a $1,617 tuition increase for its second year of a three-year effort to reach a balanced budget and fully fund the program. The college of medicine is also asking to keep tuition flat for Doctor of Medicine students as well as those enrolling in the Master of Science in Athletic Training and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\n\nThe UI Master of Clinical Nutrition program is requesting to keep tuition flat for nonresident students and increase tuition by 3% for resident students, and the physician's assistant program is asking for a 2.5% increase for all students. The UI College of Nursing is also requesting no increase in tuition for its students, and the College of Pharmacy is proposing a .75% increase for both resident and nonresident students.\n\nUNI will request to have \"supplemental tuition\" of $1,944 for its nursing program to handle costs of simulation and lab equipment and meet requirements for student learning and accreditation. Annual costs are expected to exceed $100,000, the document stated, with periodic additional costs of repair and replacement, and could increase over time. If approved, the tuition would match costs for students in the Wilson College of Business.\n\nISU is requesting that certain students within the Ivy School of Business have tuition increased -- $1,340 for residents and $2,476 for nonresidents -- in order to align rates for sophomore business majors with juniors and seniors. This will be the second of three years working to simplify the differential tuition rate structure, according to the document, and will align the costs for business students with those enrolled in the engineering, agricultural systems technology and industrial technology programs.\n\nThe university's veterinary medicine program is proposing a 5% tuition increase for in-state students and 3.5% increase for out-of-state students in order to support faculty and students, maintain equipment and access new technologies. The executive MBA program, geared toward senior business leaders, is also requesting a 10% increase in tuition, as its tuition hasn't changed since its inception in 2019 and funds are needed to cover costs of instruction, materials and travel.\n\nISU is also seeking to change its tuition assessment policies for graduate students in interdepartmental majors, according to the document. As the majors are offered by faculty representing a major rather than a specific department or college, tuition for them currently aligns with the faculty member's department, and the university is requesting approval to instead align it with the student's area of study.\n\n\"This proposal treats students pursuing the same degree equitably, regardless of the home department of their major professor, and will increase cost transparency for prospective students,\" the document stated. \"Additionally, the change will improve operational efficiency, align tuition rates with the cost of instruction, and support the goal of growing enrollment in interdepartmental programs.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The board meets Friday to consider the proposal for the first time.\n\nThose smaller proposed tuition increases tie directly to a larger proposed state appropriation, according to board documents -- reminding the public of its fall request for $14.8 million more in general university appropriations for the 2025 budget year.\n\nThe Iowa Legislature recently passed a budget bill appropriating $12.3 million of that request for the next budget year, amounting to a 2.5 percent increase over this year.\n\nLawmakers last session rebuffed the regents' request for $32 million more in general education appropriations, keeping allocations flat -- although designating an additional $7.1 million for special uses, like the UI College of Nursing, ISU STEM workforce initiatives and UNI's teacher-student recruitment efforts.\n\nSo long as Gov. Kim Reynolds signs the budget bill for fiscal 2025, Iowa's public universities would hold increases for resident undergraduate students to $270 at the UI and ISU and $168 at UNI for the academic year.\n\nIn proposing the increases, the board office said it weighed \"state support, operating costs that may be absorbed through efficiencies and reallocations, and the expected inflationary impact to higher education budgets.\"\n\nAt the non-resident undergraduate level, increase at the UI are expected to be lower than those being proposed for in-state undergrads, at 1.3 percent, but higher for ISU at 4.5 percent, UNI is keeping its proposed increases at 2 percent for both in-state and out-of-state undergrads -- although that amounts to a larger increase for non-residents students, or $400 a year.\n\nAll UNI graduate students are facing a matching 2-percent bump next fall, while ISU is proposing a 4.5 percent hike for all its grad students -- amounting to $469 more for in-state students and $1,254 for non-resident students.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Oregon ranks 32nd among states for public investment in higher education, according to the Colorado-based policy group State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.\n\nNearly every public university in the state has approved tuition increases of 3% to 5% for the 2024-25 school year, while the board of Eastern Oregon University in La Grande is preparing to vote on a tuition increase within that range by May 15. Any tuition increases above 5% require that the universities' boards get approval from the Higher Education Coordinating Commission.\n\n\"Oregon public universities have some of the highest tuition and fee rates among Western states,\" said Ben Cannon, executive director of the commission, in an email. \"We are very concerned about increased tuition and rising college costs as a whole (including tuition, housing, books, etc.), particularly as they affect low-income populations who are struggling most.\"\n\nThe tuition hikes means that in-state freshmen at the University of Oregon will pay more than $16,100 a year, while in-state full-time students at Portland State University will pay about $11,800 compared with $14,400 for Oregon State University. The three universities have the highest enrollment in the state, and the University of Oregon and Oregon State are the most expensive public universities in the state.\n\nThe schools say rising inflation and higher staff costs, including contributions to the state's Public Employees Retirement System, or PERS, along with the cost of materials and capital investment are also behind the tuition hikes. Despite dramatic rises in tuition during the last decade, full-time enrollment in Oregon's four-year universities has declined by about 3,000 students since 2014, and the number of students enrolled in classes has fallen by about 4,000 over that time period. Last fall, nearly 80,000 students were enrolled at Oregon's public universities, and more than 98,000 were taking classes.\n\nAt every university, student tuition and fees make up more than half of revenue, one of the highest proportions in the nation, according to a recent report commissioned by lawmakers from the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, a nonprofit think tank in Colorado. About 25 years ago, public funding accounted for up to 75% of the cost of each full-time employee at an Oregon university. Now, it pays for about 50% or less, researchers found. Oregon's per-pupil funding for full-time college students is about $5,600 annually, around $3,000 less than what California and Washington provide.\n\n\"When the Oregon state Legislature and our governor fail to prioritize meaningful state investment in our college and universities, Oregon's students' foot the bill via yearly tuition increases,\" Nick Keough, legislative director for the nonprofit student advocacy group Oregon Student Association, said in an email. \"Continual tuition increases are undoubtedly pricing Oregonians and students out of higher education every day, while contributing to the exasperation of the student debt crisis here in Oregon.\"\n\nHere's a look at the tuition hikes at Oregon's public universities:\n\nEastern Oregon University\n\nStudents enrolled at Eastern Oregon University will see a tuition hike in the next school year, though it won't exceed 5%, according to Tim Seydel, a university spokesperson. The school's Tuition Advisory Committee has not settled on a number but will recommend that the Board of Trustees vote on the tuition at their May 15 meeting, Seydel said in an email. The school currently offers the lowest tuition of any Oregon public university, about $10,700 for Oregon residents enrolled full time.\n\nOregon State University\n\nResident and non-resident students at Oregon's largest university by enrollment will see tuition rise more than 4.5% next fall. More than 60% of undergraduates are non-residents, and about half of all students, including graduate students, at Oregon State are from out of state.\n\nStudents from outside Oregon pay nearly three times as much for tuition. Resident undergraduates attending full-time this year are paying about $13,800 in tuition and fees. Out-of-state undergraduates are paying about $36,600.\n\nTuition will rise 2% for resident graduate students and more than 5% for non-resident graduate students. Online credits will cost more than 4.5% more and the cost of participating in doctoral and professional graduate programs will rise by 3% to 7%. Student fees will also go up to pay for counselors and psychological services, capital projects and student health services.\n\nThe university will offer students $125 million in financial aid, according to Sean Nealon, a university spokesperson. That's almost three times what it was five years ago, he said in a news release.\n\nUniversity of Oregon\n\nTuition is locked in for five years for each incoming class of freshman at the University of Oregon so that students pay the same tuition for the first five years. Next year's freshman will pay 3% more than freshman this year. The university hiked tuition 11% for the freshman class of 2019; added 3% for freshman in 2020; another 3.7% for freshman in 2021; about 4% for freshman in 2022; and 4% more for freshman enrolled in the current 2023-24 academic year. Those students today pay more than $15,600 a year - more than 25% more than what freshmen paid just six years ago.\n\nPortland State University\n\nResident undergraduate students will see tuition rise by nearly 5%, or about $10 per credit hour. Non-resident students will pay 3% more. A full-time resident student today pays more than $11,238 per year, an increase of more than $5,000 in the last six years.\n\nWestern Oregon University\n\nResident and non-resident tuition will go up by 5% and nearly 5%, respectively. Graduate tuition will also rise 5%. Western will still be the second-least-expensive university in the state, according to Maureen Brakke, communications director for the school. Only Eastern Oregon University is less expensive, about $1,000 less than Western's $11,000 tuition cost for in-state, full-time enrollment.\n\nOregon Institute of Technology\n\nOregon Tech, with campuses in Klamath Falls and Portland, will increase tuition by 4.5%.\n\nThe school increased tuition 7% in 2022 and 4% in 2023. Most undergraduate students today pay, on average, about $12,700, at least $1,000 more per year than they did three years ago.\n\nSouthern Oregon University\n\nSouthern Oregon University in Ashland will increase tuition for most students by nearly 5% for the 2024-25 academic year. That means that in-state full-time students will pay about $12,700 a year, an increase of about $600 per year from 2023-24. Tuition costs for several master's programs in education and business administration will remain unchanged.", "source": {"uri": "eastoregonian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Oregonian"},

Baker, an associate professor at the University of Delaware, examined the impact of student loans on STEM degrees. Baker's findings underscore a significant increase in the cost of attending public four-year colleges in the United States, which has more than doubled since the early 1990s, even after adjusting for inflation.\n\nUndergraduate student loan debt has reached levels that many find unmanageable. On average, bachelor's degree recipients borrow around $41,300, with most still owing 92% of their loan four years after graduation. Alarmingly, nearly one-third of borrowers who took out loans between 1998 and 2018 have defaulted on their payments.\n\nThe burden of student loan debt does not affect all equally -- it varies significantly across racial groups and fields of study. Recent data reveals that the repayment patterns for STEM graduates differ markedly, with debts ranging from 59% for engineering graduates to 94% for those in biological, physical, and agricultural sciences four years post-graduation.\n\nThis variation extends to tuition costs as well. Some universities charge differential tuition rates, making STEM degrees more expensive. For instance, engineering and computer science students at the University of Maryland pay nearly 27% more per semester than their peers in other disciplines.\n\nThe United States currently relies on a disparate collection of policies that aim to make college seem affordable while in reality forcing students to manage significant disparities in the cost of higher education. As a result, many students are burdened with debt that can impact them for decades. Learning from the approaches of other countries in how they structure their educational funding policies to genuinely lower student costs and provide targeted tuition subsidies could offer valuable insights.\n\nFor example, Australia's Commonwealth Grant Scheme effectively combines tuition caps with differential tuition and government subsidies to manage education costs more equitably. Under this scheme, the government sets maximum amounts that students are expected to pay for different majors, supplemented by government contributions that vary based on the educational cost of the major and its prioritized importance.\n\nIn 2014, mathematics students at Australian public institutions were capped at a maximum contribution of A$8,613, with the government adding A$9,782. Meanwhile, engineering students paid the same maximum but received a much higher government contribution of A$21,707.\n\nThis approach contrasts sharply with tuition rates in the United States, where the highest annual tuition at public four-year institutions can be nearly three times greater than the average maximum student contribution in Australia. Additionally, even the highest student contributions in Australia for any discipline are significantly lower than the highest annual tuition fees in the U.S. This explains why an engineering management masters degree in the U.S. is probably the most expensive in the world.\n\nThe UK's experience with tuition caps also offers lessons, albeit mixed. The government there capped tuition for all domestic undergraduate students while reducing funding for higher education, leading to unintended consequences such as course and program cuts, reduced faculty compensation, and a reliance on higher fees from international students. This situation underscores that tuition caps without complementary public support can compromise the quality of education while attempting to make it more affordable.\n\nFor the U.S. to adopt a similar approach to tuition caps, comprehensive policy planning under the Higher Education Act would be necessary. Key considerations would include determining whom the caps would benefit, who would set them, how often they should be reset, and whether they should vary by major or class load. Additionally, the implications of such caps on financial aid, student borrowing, and the financial health of educational institutions would need careful examination.\n\nExperts on college affordability and tuition policies should convene to deliberate on the effectiveness of tuition caps within the broader context of enhancing accessibility to STEM disciplines. Given that most funding for public universities comes from state budgets, federal efforts might be insufficient on their own. The decentralized nature of U.S. higher education often obscures vital data from researchers and policymakers, which is crucial for formulating effective policies. Therefore, higher education leaders, especially in STEM fields, should actively participate in ongoing dialogues aimed at real changes in college affordability to remove barriers to STEM education and careers.\n\nDominique J.

UNI would raise its nonresident tuition by 2% and ISU's nonresident tuition would increase by 4.5%.\n\nThe rising prices would bring UI tuition to $9,286 for residents and $31,374 for nonresidents, ISU tuition to $9,252 for residents and $27,346 for nonresidents and UNI tuition to $8,564 for residents and $20,340 for nonresidents.\n\nThe board will discuss the tuition rates at its meeting Friday, with final action slated for June.\n\n\"Funding from the proposed tuition increases will help address growing financial challenges including inflationary cost increases, recruiting and retaining faculty and staff in national markets, meeting collective bargaining terms, deferred maintenance needs in academic facilities, and student financial aid to provide higher education opportunities to more students,\" the document stated.\n\nThese increases are smaller than the tuition hikes approved over the past two years, with prices for in-state undergrads at all three universities going up by 3.25% in 2023 and 4.25% in 2022. According to the board of regents document, the universities considered the 2.5% increase in state funding they will receive in fiscal year 2025, pending Gov. Kim Reynolds' signature, as well as potential operating cost savings through \"efficiencies and reallocations\" and impacts of inflation on budgets when developing their proposed tuition increases.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report cited in the board of regents document, the core inflation rate in the 12-month period ending in March was 3.8%.\n\nMandatory fees for students will also increase at each of the universities, by 1.3% to $1,534 at ISU, by 2.5% to $1,997 at the UI and by 3% to $1,372 at UNI.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPotential increases for graduate student tuition vary across the colleges, with UNI and ISU raising rates for both resident and nonresident students by 2% and 4.5%, respectively, and the UI upping tuition for in-state students by 3.5% and nonresident students by 1.3%.\n\nGraduate students would also see mandatory fee increases -- a 1.4% raise to $1,474 at ISU, a 2.5% raise to $2,004 at the UI and a 3% raise to $1,372 at UNI.\n\n\"The proposed tuition rates at all three universities combined are projected to generate $35 million in incremental revenue for FY 2025, approximately 1.9% of the current total general education fund operating budget,\" the document stated.\n\nThe universities will request special tuition rates for certain programs, according to the board of regents document, to balance budgets and provide financial support.\n\nAt the UI, the Carver College of Medicine's Radiation Sciences Program is requesting a $1,617 tuition increase for its second year of a three-year effort to reach a balanced budget and fully fund the program. The college of medicine is also asking to keep tuition flat for Doctor of Medicine students as well as those enrolling in the Master of Science in Athletic Training and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\n\nThe UI Master of Clinical Nutrition program is requesting to keep tuition flat for nonresident students and increase tuition by 3% for resident students, and the physician's assistant program is asking for a 2.5% increase for all students. The UI College of Nursing is also requesting no increase in tuition for its students, and the College of Pharmacy is proposing a .75% increase for both resident and nonresident students.\n\nUNI will request to have \"supplemental tuition\" of $1,944 for its nursing program to handle costs of simulation and lab equipment and meet requirements for student learning and accreditation. Annual costs are expected to exceed $100,000, the document stated, with periodic additional costs of repair and replacement, and could increase over time. If approved, the tuition would match costs for students in the Wilson College of Business.\n\nISU is requesting that certain students within the Ivy School of Business have tuition increased -- $1,340 for residents and $2,476 for nonresidents -- in order to align rates for sophomore business majors with juniors and seniors. This will be the second of three years working to simplify the differential tuition rate structure, according to the document, and will align the costs for business students with those enrolled in the engineering, agricultural systems technology and industrial technology programs.\n\nThe university's veterinary medicine program is proposing a 5% tuition increase for in-state students and 3.5% increase for out-of-state students in order to support faculty and students, maintain equipment and access new technologies. The executive MBA program, geared toward senior business leaders, is also requesting a 10% increase in tuition, as its tuition hasn't changed since its inception in 2019 and funds are needed to cover costs of instruction, materials and travel.\n\nISU is also seeking to change its tuition assessment policies for graduate students in interdepartmental majors, according to the document. As the majors are offered by faculty representing a major rather than a specific department or college, tuition for them currently aligns with the faculty member's department, and the university is requesting approval to instead align it with the student's area of study.\n\n\"This proposal treats students pursuing the same degree equitably, regardless of the home department of their major professor, and will increase cost transparency for prospective students,\" the document stated. \"Additionally, the change will improve operational efficiency, align tuition rates with the cost of instruction, and support the goal of growing enrollment in interdepartmental programs.\"\n\nThe post State universities propose tuition increases to Iowa Board of Regents appeared first on Iowa Capital Dispatch.\n\nBest colleges in Iowa Best colleges in Iowa #10.

(Logo via Iowa Board of Regents)\n\nIowa's public universities are proposing smaller tuition increases than in past years for this fall as they balance savings from a slight increase in state allocations and other efforts with impacts from inflation, recruiting and retaining talent and providing more opportunities for students.\n\nProposed tuition rates for state universities would have undergraduate resident students paying 3% more at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and 2% more at the University of Northern Iowa, according to Iowa Board of Regent documents.\n\nPeople are also reading...

UNI would raise its nonresident tuition by 2% and ISU's nonresident tuition would increase by 4.5%.\n\nThe rising prices would bring UI tuition to $9,286 for residents and $31,374 for nonresidents, ISU tuition to $9,252 for residents and $27,346 for nonresidents and UNI tuition to $8,564 for residents and $20,340 for nonresidents.\n\nThe board will discuss the tuition rates at its meeting Friday, with final action slated for June.\n\n\"Funding from the proposed tuition increases will help address growing financial challenges including inflationary cost increases, recruiting and retaining faculty and staff in national markets, meeting collective bargaining terms, deferred maintenance needs in academic facilities, and student financial aid to provide higher education opportunities to more students,\" the document stated.\n\nThese increases are smaller than the tuition hikes approved over the past two years, with prices for in-state undergrads at all three universities going up by 3.25% in 2023 and 4.25% in 2022. According to the board of regents document, the universities considered the 2.5% increase in state funding they will receive in fiscal year 2025, pending Gov. Kim Reynolds' signature, as well as potential operating cost savings through \"efficiencies and reallocations\" and impacts of inflation on budgets when developing their proposed tuition increases.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report cited in the board of regents document, the core inflation rate in the 12-month period ending in March was 3.8%.\n\nMandatory fees for students will also increase at each of the universities, by 1.3% to $1,534 at ISU, by 2.5% to $1,997 at the UI and by 3% to $1,372 at UNI.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPotential increases for graduate student tuition vary across the colleges, with UNI and ISU raising rates for both resident and nonresident students by 2% and 4.5%, respectively, and the UI upping tuition for in-state students by 3.5% and nonresident students by 1.3%.\n\nGraduate students would also see mandatory fee increases -- a 1.4% raise to $1,474 at ISU, a 2.5% raise to $2,004 at the UI and a 3% raise to $1,372 at UNI.\n\n\"The proposed tuition rates at all three universities combined are projected to generate $35 million in incremental revenue for FY 2025, approximately 1.9% of the current total general education fund operating budget,\" the document stated.\n\nThe universities will request special tuition rates for certain programs, according to the board of regents document, to balance budgets and provide financial support.\n\nAt the UI, the Carver College of Medicine's Radiation Sciences Program is requesting a $1,617 tuition increase for its second year of a three-year effort to reach a balanced budget and fully fund the program. The college of medicine is also asking to keep tuition flat for Doctor of Medicine students as well as those enrolling in the Master of Science in Athletic Training and Doctor of Physical Therapy.\n\nThe UI Master of Clinical Nutrition program is requesting to keep tuition flat for nonresident students and increase tuition by 3% for resident students, and the physician's assistant program is asking for a 2.5% increase for all students. The UI College of Nursing is also requesting no increase in tuition for its students, and the College of Pharmacy is proposing a .75% increase for both resident and nonresident students.\n\nUNI will request to have \"supplemental tuition\" of $1,944 for its nursing program to handle costs of simulation and lab equipment and meet requirements for student learning and accreditation. Annual costs are expected to exceed $100,000, the document stated, with periodic additional costs of repair and replacement, and could increase over time. If approved, the tuition would match costs for students in the Wilson College of Business.\n\nISU is requesting that certain students within the Ivy School of Business have tuition increased -- $1,340 for residents and $2,476 for nonresidents -- in order to align rates for sophomore business majors with juniors and seniors. This will be the second of three years working to simplify the differential tuition rate structure, according to the document, and will align the costs for business students with those enrolled in the engineering, agricultural systems technology and industrial technology programs.\n\nThe university's veterinary medicine program is proposing a 5% tuition increase for in-state students and 3.5% increase for out-of-state students in order to support faculty and students, maintain equipment and access new technologies. The executive MBA program, geared toward senior business leaders, is also requesting a 10% increase in tuition, as its tuition hasn't changed since its inception in 2019 and funds are needed to cover costs of instruction, materials and travel.\n\nISU is also seeking to change its tuition assessment policies for graduate students in interdepartmental majors, according to the document. As the majors are offered by faculty representing a major rather than a specific department or college, tuition for them currently aligns with the faculty member's department, and the university is requesting approval to instead align it with the student's area of study.\n\n\"This proposal treats students pursuing the same degree equitably, regardless of the home department of their major professor, and will increase cost transparency for prospective students,\" the document stated. \"Additionally, the change will improve operational efficiency, align tuition rates with the cost of instruction, and support the goal of growing enrollment in interdepartmental programs.\"\n\nThe post State universities propose tuition increases to Iowa Board of Regents appeared first on Iowa Capital Dispatch.\n\nBest colleges in Iowa #3.

{"id": 225016932, "title": "Long-term Chelsea commitment to Enzo Maresca will only work if he is given time", "text": "The last Chelsea manager to survive five years at Stamford Bridge was Dave Sexton. When he was appointed in 1967, none of co-owners Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali or Jose Feliciano had been born. But Chelsea\u2019s ownership triumvirate of bona fide business magnates were not born yesterday and have total conviction in their plan to install a head coach who will flourish and grow with the Blues in the long term. Enzo Maresca is expected to be handed a five-year contract as Chelsea were finalising his appointment as their new head coach. This will be the second time in two years of ownership that Chelsea\u2019s new chiefs have appointed a man they believe can break the mould of short-termism in modern football. The reservations beyond Stamford Bridge, however, point to the fact that Graham Potter, their first choice for an ownership-defining boss, lasted less than seven months of his own five-year contract. Chelsea are known to prize Maresca\u2019s tutelage under Manchester City\u2019s true modern coaching great Pep Guardiola. The Blues believe Maresca can emulate Mikel Arteta, who has progressed from his own apprenticeship under Guardiola to do a fine job with Arsenal. The Gunners are firing on all cylinders, having pushed Guardiola\u2019s exceptional City side all the way in the title race and finishing second. The same cannot be said for the early stages of Arteta\u2019s Arsenal tenure, especially in the low point of December 2020. Arsenal had finished eighth in 2019-20, though Arteta also led the Gunners to an FA Cup triumph having taken the reins midway through that season. His first full campaign then fell into the funk of seven winless Premier League matches in the run up to Christmas, with five defeats and two draws providing the opposite of festive cheer. This is where Arsenal\u2019s hierarchy dug down and held on, despite a wider clamour for Arteta\u2019s sacking. A 3-1 win home win against Chelsea on Boxing Day proved the start of a vital recovery, and having completed wide-ranging reorganisations behind the scenes, Arsenal have not looked back. Arsenal have rejigged their off-field set-up to Arteta\u2019s requirements, and have set great stall in their former midfielder turned head footballing honcho. Chelsea are handling their business differently, and will bank on their new footballing hierarchy becoming a potent entity that can flourish through the strength of its very organisation. The installation of co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart provides continuity to cover all coaching eventualities, with a highly-regarded recruitment and scouting department now in place and fully functioning, too. Chelsea\u2019s new owners have worked hard to build a system which they strongly believe will be effective. And they hope that a solid structure will help foster a long-term stewardship from their next head coach. But when it comes to ensuring that Maresca can stay at the Stamford Bridge helm for multiple years, patience will be key. Chelsea believe their current squad is strong enough for a top-four Premier League finish, but Mauricio Pochettino has not departed solely for finishing sixth. His relationship with the Chelsea hierarchy had fractured, and the 52-year-old was by no means blameless in those tensions. Pochettino knew exactly the off-field set-up that Chelsea both favoured and would prioritise, but in the end struggled to operate in that environment. Both parties ultimately realised what they had hoped would build into a fruitful working relationship was in danger of becoming a marriage of convenience. So, while Chelsea will have a seventh face at the helm, whether permanent or temporary, in five years, Stamford Bridge bosses are adamant that Maresca will represent a far closer west London fit. Even the beloved but tempestuous Jose Mourinho only just managed to last a little more than five years across two stints in charge at Chelsea. Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel mustered 18 months, so did favourite son Frank Lampard, with Antonio Conte lasting two years at the tiller. Chelsea\u2019s young squad need some stability after two years of constant upheaval. If time is football\u2019s last priceless commodity, Chelsea will have to strike a delicate balance between the need for quick results and lasting progress.", "summary": "<p>Second time in two years Blues bosses have appointed a man they believe can break the mould in modern football</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/maresca-chelsea-fc-contract-2024-b1160803.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/27/12/18/GettyImages_2073198292.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XtePcjaU-BqwSYW3q.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:48:11", "author": "Nick Purewal", "authors": ["Nick Purewal"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.07}

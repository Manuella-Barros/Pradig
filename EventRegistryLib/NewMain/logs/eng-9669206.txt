The Washington Legislature last year expanded the definition of illegal street racing to include the takeover of intersections, dangerous displays (such as \"donuts\"), and racing in off-street areas like parking lots.\n\nBy adding the $500 citation, however, Seattle goes further than the state -- and possibly gives the city another tool to go after the now-infamous \"Belltown Hellcat\" driver, who's made international headlines for flaunting his Dodge Charger on Seattle's streets and Instagram.\n\nThe motive for the proposed new citation, said Deputy City Attorney Scott Lindsay, is to help police crackdown on large street racing events, which are relatively common, especially in the summer months.\n\n\"This legislation responds to the recent rise in large street racing takeover events that pose a safety hazard to the public -- pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers,\" Davison said. \"The new civil infraction will give police a tool to hold vehicle owners accountable when their cars are used at these events.\"\n\nCity Hall has tried to wrap its arms around illegal street racing in recent years. The events, which can quickly swell to nearly 100 cars, pop up around the city -- including recently in Wallingford, West Seattle, Lower Queen Anne, Capitol Hill and Rainier Valley. They're loud, disruptive and, as occurred last summer in Auburn, occasionally deadly.\n\nThe city last year signed off on installing new traffic cameras in areas around the city to help crack down on illegal street racing. But individual officers are limited in what they can do to break up the events as they happen.\n\nUnder current law, officers must identify and try to arrest the person driving the car in an illegal street race. That's difficult when a single patrol vehicle is dispatched to events with a large number of cars and people.\n\nIf passed, the new law would allow officers to write down license plate numbers and other identifying features and cite the cars' owners -- similar to how parking tickets or tolls are issued now.\n\nWhile the so-called Hellcat driver, Miles Hudson, was not the motivator for the new law, it could be used against him. Hudson has gained internet infamy by speeding his noisy -- and leopard-print -- sport car down Seattle's streets.\n\nHudson, 20, was charged in March with two counts of reckless driving stemming from a video posted in February that showed a driver racing at speeds up to 107 mph in an area where the limit is 25 mph. He has pleaded not guilty to both charges.\n\nIn May, he was sued by the city of Seattle and ordered to comply with the requirements of various traffic and city citations he's received over several months. The Seattle city attorney later filed a court order demanding he pay $83,619.97 in civil penalties and other fees after he failed to respond to the lawsuit in time.\n\nHe was ordered to not drive the Hellcat, but in several videos posted on Instagram, where he has 759,000 followers, he's seen in the passenger seat while others drive his car.\n\nIf passed, the new law would mean officers could write tickets to Hudson even as a passenger. Both he and his mother are listed as owners, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCouncilmember Bob Kettle is sponsoring the bill.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Meanwhile, the Seattle City Council -- prompted most likely by his antics -- is considering giving police a new tool to write $500 street-racing tickets.\n\nA newly proposed fine before the city council in Seattle would allow police to write a $500 ticket to the owner or the driver of any car being used in illegal street racing. Key to the plan is that the fines could be imposed not only on the vehicle's owner, but on any person behind the wheel, meaning police would not even have to stop a car to issue a citation.\n\nIt adds heft to an action last year by the Washington Legislature that expanded the definition of illegal street racing to include the takeover of intersections, dangerous displays (such as \"donuts\"), and racing in off-street areas like parking lots.\n\nEarlier this year, 20-year-old Miles Hudson was charged with driving his Hellcat at speeds of more than 100 miles per hour through 25-mph zones in a dense city neighborhood, to which he pleaded not guilty. Residents of the Belltown neighborhood in particular have complained about the excessive noise, but the speed is the alarming part. He has documented his antics on Instagram.\n\nIn May, the Seattle city attorney filed a court order demanding that the driver pay $83,619.97 in civil penalties and other fees after he failed to respond in time to a lawsuit filed against him last month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hudson appeared in Seattle Municipal Court, where a judge upheld the civil penalties. He is subject to an additional $1,300 a day in penalties for every day he does not comply with an order to quiet the exhaust on his Hellcat -- or at least return it to stock condition. He told the judge the car was in the shop. The city said Hudson continues to \"flaunt\" his car's excessive noise on his Instagram account.\n\nHudson appeared in court wearing all black and with his face covered in a black ski mask and dark glasses. The prosecution asked the judge to order him to reveal himself, but the judge allowed him to keep the mask on.\n\nWhen reporters asked him why he was in disguise, Hudson said, cryptically, \"I'm kind of shiesty and felling myself.\"\n\nHe once told an officer during a traffic stop that income from his social posts had paid for his car, so when asked Tuesday how he would come up with money for the penalty, he responded, \"With a little bit of motion?\" And, \"I wouldn't say come up. Who's to say I don't have it?\"\n\nHe said he left the court feeling \"chillin'\" and \"composed.\"\n\nThe pending street-racing legislation \"responds to the recent rise in large street racing takeover events that pose a safety hazard to the public -- pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers,\" said Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison. \"The new civil infraction will give police a tool to hold vehicle owners accountable when their cars are used at these events.\"\n\nWhere Hellcat Hudson is concerned: Under current law, officers must identify and try to arrest the person driving a car illegally. Which is difficult when a single patrol vehicle is dispatched to events with a large number of cars and people. And since being told he couldn't drive the Hellcat, Hudson has posted videos showing him as a passenger while others drive.\n\nIf passed, the new law would allow officers to write down license plate numbers and other identifying features and cite the cars' owners no matter who's driving -- similar to how parking tickets or tolls are issued now.", "source": {"uri": "autoblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autoblog"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_williams@autoblog.com", "name": "Stephen Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Street racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belltown,_Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belltown, Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belltown, Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Municipal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Municipal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Davison_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ann Davison (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle City Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_violation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parking violation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle registration plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toll road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1913x1076+0+0/resize/800x450!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2024/06/19113455/Belltown-Hellcat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669206", "eventUri": "eng-9669206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

That law was adopted by state legislators in 2023 and went into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nDavison's proposal would further seek to disincentivize street racing by establishing a $500 civil infraction against the registered owner of a vehicle participating. This fine is not a part of state law.\n\n\"This legislation responds to the recent rise in large street racing takeover events that pose a safety hazard to the public -- pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers,\" Davison said in a news release. \"The new civil infraction will give police a tool to hold vehicle owners accountable when their cars are used at these events.\"\n\nLast July, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance that kickstarted the city's plans to install more automated traffic safety cameras throughout the city and designate restricted street racing zones.\n\nIn that same month, a woman was shot and killed at an illegal street racing event in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.\n\nDavison's office also noted that as recently as last month, dozens of drivers continue to participate in street takeovers, despite police presence and repeated warnings from officers.\n\n\"We must take action in the face of these increasing incidents, particularly as a nexus for gun violence, and this new law would be an important step forward,\" Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said.\n\nThe legislation will have to be approved by the city council and signed by Harrell before it can go into effect.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkkit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Talk KIT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@newstalkkit.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Street racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Davison_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ann Davison (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle City Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_infraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil infraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drifting (motorsport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Harrell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Harrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Public_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Public Art", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/1148/files/2024/06/attachment-Street-Racing.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669206", "eventUri": "eng-9669206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 414, "textEnd": 420}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

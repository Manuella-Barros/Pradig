One of the first candidates to visit the Ireland South count centre at Nemo Rangers GAA club in Cork today was Ireland First President Derek Blighe. Mr Blighe, an anti-immigration activist, contested both the Cork Co Council and European Parliament elections. He visited the centre with family and supporters and viewed the counting of ballots.

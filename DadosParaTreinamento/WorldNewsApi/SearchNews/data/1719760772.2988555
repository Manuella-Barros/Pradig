Photos from the scene appear to show boxes of doughnuts from the popular American chain scattered on the ground. The box structure from the rear of the truck had also been knocked off. Staff at the supermarket called in safety experts to secure the site and workers were seen removing the van on Tuesday afternoon (May 28).

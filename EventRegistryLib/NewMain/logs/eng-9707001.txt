This is a one-off, Target was just a one-off. I feel lucky that I can have the choice to not have to rush back to work,\" she explained to the cameras. \"I want to fully raise my child and be a stay at home mom.\"\n\nKourtney and Travis, 48, reunited after getting their individual glam done. They shared a kiss after which Kourtney immediately stuck her tongue out. Travis leaned in for another kiss but then course corrected and the couple instead touched their tongues together before getting one more peck in.\n\nThe duo are no strangers to oversharing about their relationship on the hit Hulu series. Throughout season 5, Kourtney and Travis have documented the most surprising moments leading up to the birth of their first child together. (The drummer shares son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 18, with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.)\n\nIn an episode that aired in June, Kourtney opened up about why she wanted to wait a little longer before delivering her son.\n\n\"I am not ready. My husband is on a plane coming home,\" she told her mother, Kris Jenner. \"I need to have sex.\"\n\nKris wasn't expecting this much information from Kourtney, who continued, \"Yeah because then you can't have sex for six weeks after.\"\n\nThe Kardashians subsequently featured footage of Kourtney giving birth to baby Rocky. Before their child entered the world, the pair initially ended up at the hospital too early so they had to head back home.\n\nKourtney, however, was already dilated, which is why viewers weren't expecting to hear about how the twosome had sex. \"We went home, ate at Crossroads, showered, slept in our bed and then we had sex to get things going to see if that helps,\" Kourtney, who was three centimeters dilated, told the cameras in the June episode. \"That can help sometimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kourtney_kardashian@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kourtney Kardashian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "us_weekly@usmagazine.com", "name": "Us Weekly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "yana_grebenyuk@usmagazine.com", "name": "Yana Grebenyuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Barker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Barker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourtney_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kourtney Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanna_Moakler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanna Moakler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Awards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kourtney-Kardashian-and-Travis-Barker-Touch-Tongues-Before-Kissing-Each-Other.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707001", "eventUri": "eng-9707001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 21, "textEnd": 27}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Her 4th time around, Kourtney Kardashian knows what she wants and is setting the boundaries to make it happen. In the latest episode of The Kardashians on Hulu, Kourtney reveals how she's doing postpartum differently with Rocky, the baby she shares with husband Travis Barker.\n\nOn a call with Kim and Khloe a month after Rocky's birth, Kourtney tells her sisters she hasn't left the house, and is in the midst of completing an intentional 40 days at home with her new baby.\n\n\"In many different cultures, women don't leave the house after having a baby for 40 days, to let your body have that time to heal,\" she tells the confessional cam. \"And beyond that I'm really into attachment parenting.\"\n\nKourtney elaborates on her version of attachment parenting, \"I really don't separate from him. I love being at home right now. My time is dedicated to taking care of my baby and bonding with him.\"\n\nOn the phone with her sisters, Kourtney adds, \"I just feel like I don't even want to go anywhere still.\" The call comes to an end when Kourtney announces, \"I'm gonna go back to my blissful baby bubble now.\"\n\nIn the US, one of the only countries in the world without paid maternity leave, unfortunately we can't all afford the luxury of a blissful baby bubble. Still, Kourtney's instinct to stay within hers is relatable.\n\nLater in the episode, Kris Jenner visits Kourtney at home as she's being fitted for an outfit to wear to the Emmy Awards, where she plans to watch Travis perform the opener before leaving early to get back to the baby and stick to her breastfeeding schedule.\n\nKourtney admits she's starting to feel \"a bit of anxiety about going back to the world.\"\n\nAs Kris peruses dress options, Kourtney tells her \"I still have 10 pounds... if I care to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight.\" Her mother interrupts her to say, \"Of course you care.\"\n\nKourtney clarifies, \"I care to get back, but I'm breastfeeding, so I'm taking my time.\" Moments later, she re-enters the room in corseted shapewear and a bra, to encouragement from Kris who exclaims, \"It's amazing how the body can snap back!\"\n\nIn confessional, Kourtney compares her attitude now to when she was a first-time mom to Mason, born to her and ex-boyfriend Scott Disick in 2009. \"My priority is not bouncing back and getting my body back in shape like it has been in the past.\"\n\n\"I remember after having Mason that it used to be a really big thing to talk about how soon can you bounce back... I did a magazine cover in a bikini and [remember] stressing myself out to eat a certain diet.\"\n\nThe magazine cover appears on screen with the headline 'How I Lost 33lbs,' over Kourtney's thin, bikini-clad figure.\n\nOGs to keeping up with the ubiquitously prominent family may remember the 2010 episode of Kourtney & Khloe Take Miami where Kourtney ends up in the back of an ambulance. She collapsed while exercising amidst extreme dieting as she prepared for the Lifestyle photo shoot scheduled just 3 months postpartum.\n\nKourtney's postpartum body is the topic of another episode following the birth of her second child with Disick. She stands on a scale, down to 115 pounds, and Scott asks what she weighed when they first met. Kourtney estimates 95lbs, to which Scott quickly replies, \"Ninety-three is the dream.\"\n\nThis time around, Kourtney's approach to motherhood is different. The glowing mom of 4 tells the camera, \"This time I'm really just all about nourishing my body and eating the best foods to keep up my milk supply.\"\n\nThe Kardashians elicit mixed emotions to say the very least, but as moms, Kourtney's progress is something to celebrate.\n\nWe lived through the same body-shaming diet culture. Plenty of us survived a douchebag boyfriend or overbearing parent who felt entitled to share their expectations for our bodies. Many of us continue to struggle with loving our bodies that have aged and changed as we've created and sustained life. We've all been on the receiving end of judgments about how we choose to do motherhood and how we look doing it.\n\nPostpartum moms need support and space, in amounts that are subject to change minute by minute.

Kourtney says, as Simon says, 'No, when?'\n\n'In college. I was cleaning my bikini bottom that was hanging in my shower and a scorpion was in there and it stung my finger and it was traumatizing.

Lemme is available in stores nationwide... there's like no one around,' she says with a laugh.\n\n'I love therapy... retail therapy,' Kourtney says, while lowering her sunglasses and winking, as she notices, 'Some lady is videoing me over there... I see you videoing.'\n\nShe poses for a few snaps in front of the Lemme display before heading to the checkout lanes, asking the cashier, 'Am I allowed to lay on here?'\n\n'Sure, go for it,' he says, as Kourtney asks, 'Am I gonna be the first person to ever lay on here?' The cashier jokes, 'I laid on here last week so...' before he admits he was joking.\n\nKourtney lays on the cashier conveyor belt with bottles of Lemme products and snaps more pics and she hears a woman screaming as Kourtney says she should get some free Lemme.\n\n'Thanks team, we've had so much fun today, can't wait to see what's next,' Kourtney says in a concluding video.\n\nKourtney adds in confession, 'The only way I'm gonna shop at Target again is with Simon pushing me around the store'\n\nAs Kourtney tries to get out of the cart, she says, 'My heels are stuck in the little holes' as Simon just lifts her out of the cart\n\n'I love therapy... retail therapy,' Kourtney says, while lowering her sunglasses and winking, as she notices, 'Some lady is videoing me over there...

I'm eating burritos. I ate Chinese food last night, and if I knew it was going to be open maybe I wouldn't have,' Kourtney says with a laugh.\n\n'Today is the Emmys. Travis is drumming in the opening. We decided to come get ready at a hotel right next to the Emmys so that the baby could be with us. This is the first big public thing that I'm doing and this is our first real date night out after having a baby,' Kourtney says in confession.\n\nKourtney says while she's in glam that she last went to the Emmys 15 years ago, 'and the look was very different.'\n\nThey show a throwback red carpet snap of Kourtney in a gray gown, as she tells her team, 'I just wore this random... I don't even know the designer. I don't even know how I got it or how I even got dressed.'\n\nSomeone on the team shows a pic of her look back then, as Kourtney says she's going to call Kim and ask her about that gown.\n\n'I'm doing glam for the Emmys. We were just thinking of how the only time I went to the Emmys was with you. Do you remember? And I was pregnant. You were invite with Ryan Seacrest but he only had one seat and I think I literally went with you and did the red carpet and left. Cause this was 2009 when I was pregnant with Mason. It was like a dark gray dress with this ugly bangle.'\n\n'Today is the Emmys. Travis is drumming in the opening. We decided to come get ready at a hotel right next to the Emmys so that the baby could be with us. This is the first big public thing that I'm doing and this is our first real date night out after having a baby,' Kourtney says in confession.\n\nKim says over the phone, 'I wore like a white off the shoulder with like a blueish eye. And we got ready in your condo right down the street in Calabasas in your kitchen. What desperate...'\n\nKourtney agrees saying, 'I know. I was like imagine going to a red carpet and then...' as Kim adds, 'Now your husband is performing at the Emmys!'\n\n'He is opening the show!' Kourtney says, as Kim says, 'I can't wait to see the final look,' as they say their goodbyes.\n\nKim tells her team, 'I feel like I would never be doing a red carpet right now, if it wasn't Travis performing and I'm like going to support him. Just life with a newborn, I like haven't really gone anywhere besides Target once.'\n\n'It feels a little soon to be doing something like this, but also know, \"OK, this is one hour. Enjoy it. Be in that moment. Enjoy watching my husband on stage, have fun, and then back to my bubble,' Kourtney says in confession.\n\nKourtney tells her team, 'Glamming, pumping, breastfeeding. You'r'e gonna see this pump a lot,' as they show a shot of it.\n\n'That's like the hospital-grade pump that you rent. I rent it,' she says with a laugh, as Kourtney admits in confession, 'OK, I'm really not trying to strike a balance right now. I'm just... this is like a one-off. Target was just a one-off. I feel lucky that I can have the choice to not have to rush back to work. I want to fully raise my child and be a stay-at-home mom.'\n\nTravis enters in his black-on-black suit with a black bowtie, as Kourtney says in confession, 'I'm not back. I'm not back into the world,' as Kourtney asks Travis if they should give Rocky a kiss and he said he already gave him one as they make their way to the awards show.\n\n'But I want to make the most of being at the Emmys and being present in that moment,' Kourtney says as they exit the hotel and get on a golf cart to get whisked to the Emmys.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Huck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simon Huck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scorpion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shopping cart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Barker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Barker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(religion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confession (religion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourtney_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kourtney Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabasas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housewife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Housewife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christmas Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(jewellery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ring (jewellery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megaphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conveyor belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bikini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Seacrest", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Seacrest"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/04/06/86907873-0-image-m-96_1720069440144.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707001", "eventUri": "eng-9707001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

At the time, she was pregnant with her son Mason.\n\nDuring the episode, she called Kim to ask her if she could remember much more about the event and reminded her that she wore an \"ugly bangle\" with her dress. Kim didn't remember a whole lot either, but she did recall that they got ready \"down the street\" in Kourtney's condo in Calabasas.\n\nThe 2024 ceremony looked much different for the mom of four, who welcomed her son Rocky with Travis Barker at the end of 2023. She attended the event to watch Barker play drums to open the show and wore a suit to complement his.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Just, life with a newborn. I haven't really gone anywhere besides Target once.\"\n\nKourtney further says in a confessional that she feels \"lucky\" to be able to slowly ease back into real life after having her baby because she knows not everyone gets to do such a thing.\n\n\"It feels a little soon to be doing something like this but also know, okay, this is one hour.

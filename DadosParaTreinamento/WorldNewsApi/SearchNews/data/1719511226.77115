But how did we occupy our time? Here we look at 13 things you could do in Grimsby and Cleethorpes back in the last decade of the 20th Century that you can no longer do now ... 1. You could spend many a half-hour staring at the shelves of videos to rent. Getting annoyed when the latest release always seemed to be out on loan. Blockbuster offered the largest range and number of copies until the last remaining store in North East Lincolnshire closed in December 2013, off Lower Spring Street. A St Andrew\u2019s Hospice shop now occupies the site. 2. How many of you remember clutching a pint of Blastaway whilst dancing the night away in JD\u2019s Nightscene in Cleethorpes? It\u2019s now a luxury block of flats overlooking Ross Castle. 3. So who had to get a letter of permission from their parents and school to attend one of the annual Radio 1 Roadshows? Thousands flocked to the boating lake paddock in Cleethorpes to enjoy Deacon Blue, 911 and All Saints hosted by DJs Chris Moyles and Bruno Brookes. 4. A Cleethorpes favourite may have been the death slide inside Fantasy World; where you used to get burns on your arms when you slid down it! 5. The glory days of Grimsby Town Football Club playing in the First Division (now the Championship) \u2013 recalling the trips to Wembley, with Harry Haddock tucked under your arm. 6. Did you queue excitedly for hours outside the ABC Cinema in Freeman Street, Grimsby? Were you first in line to see the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (Cowabunga dude)? Did you take a box of tissues in for Ghost or dress up like a Stormtrooper for Star Wars Episode I? There hasn't been a multiscreen cinema in Grimsby since this three-screen venue - later becoming Odeon - closed in 2004 (though it later briefly reopened as the Regal in 2009) but that looks set to finally change after it was recently announced Parkway is to open at Freshney Place. 7. Did you make yourself sick gorging on a giant paper bag full of pick \u2019n\u2019 mix from Woolworths? Weekends often involved a trip to the store, sometimes ahead of a cinema visit if you wanted to make your pocket money stretch. 8. Did you get your high heels on and put on your best suits for the Winter Gardens\u2019 bags ball events in Cleethorpes? 9. Did you dare to jump off the top of the five-metre high diving board at Scartho baths? Or did you simply climb the vertical ladder, take one look over the edge of the board and head straight back down again! 10. Did you throw coins into the indoor fountain area at Freshney Place or take the escalator up to the Victorian-themed restaurant Turner\u2019s Traditions? Coins were routinely collected up and given to charity. 11. Maybe you shopped at clothing store C&A in Freshney Place, Grimsby \u2013 the unit was later occupied by Next. C&A stores can still be found abroad in European countries including France. 12. Did you head for a listening post in Andy\u2019s Records to check out an album before buying it? Or maybe you queued outside for the latest Oasis CD? 13. Maybe you enjoyed viewing the colourful birds housed in the aviary in Sidney Park, Cleethorpes?", "summary": "A lot has changed over the past two decades and there are some parts of the 1990s that have sadly faded away in the years since", "url": "https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/13-things-you-could-grimsby-7363216", "image": "https://i2-prod.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article7368974.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/37578031_2011-03-07_-1269224993-_mark_JDs__mark_-_.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:07:39", "author": "Abby Ruston,Mark Page", "authors": ["Abby Ruston", "Mark Page"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.098}

{"id": 232013582, "title": "See Billy Joel Bring Out Phish&#8217;s Trey Anastasio at Penultimate MSG Residency Show", "text": "There are two musical acts immortalized in the rafters of Madison Square Garden, and they both finally met onstage Saturday at the New York arena as Billy Joel brought out Phish\u2019s Trey Anastasio for a couple songs during the Piano Man\u2019s penultimate gig in his longtime MSG residency. \u201cNo one plays the the Garden more than Billy Joel and Trey Anastasio. Tonight they played together,\u201d MSG noted of the occasion, which opened with Joel playing a track the Phish guitarist requested, \u201cSleeping With the Television On.\u201d The two artists shared responsibilities on the Glass Houses track, with Joel and Anastasio trading verses before the latter brought his talents for an extended guitar solo to close out the track. From there, Joel did a jam band move by segueing directly into the second half of Derek & The Dominoes\u2019 \u201cLayla,\u201d with Anastasio again delivering the solo. Anastasio would later return at the end of the Joel\u2019s second-to-last residency show at the Garden for an extended, show-closing rendition of \u201cYou May Be Right\u201d: Joel and Phish have been mainstays at the Garden for decades, with the Piano Man performing over 150 total gigs at the World\u2019s Greatest Arena and the jam band playing upwards of 80 shows, including their famed New Year\u2019s runs and their Baker\u2019s Dozen residency. Despite long sharing the same stage albeit on different nights, Phish \u2014 who have covered hundreds of different artists in their eclectic set lists over their five decades together \u2014 have never tackled a Billy Joel song live. As JamBase notes, there were long rumors of a Garden turf war between Joel and Phish after the two acts bickered over scheduling the arena, but that speculation was probably put to rest with Saturday\u2019s collaboration. Joel\u2019s longtime monthly MSG residency will conclude next month with a July 25 show at the arena. He\u2019ll continue to perform live \u2014 and likely return to the Garden on occasion \u2014 but the guaranteed monthly gigs will come to an end. Phish will kick off their own summer tour in July, the same month they release their new album Evolve.", "summary": "Guitarist and fellow Garden staple joins the Piano Man for \"Sleeping With the Television On,\" a partial \"Layla,\" and \"You May Be Right\"", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/billy-joel-phish-trey-anastasio-garden-1235036140/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2156718870.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:02:27", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "authors": ["Daniel Kreps"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.513}

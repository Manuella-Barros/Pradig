Ryland went 16-for-25 on field goals in his rookie campaign. He was 7-for-14 from 40 yards and further in 2023. The trouble with distance kicks put Ryland on the hot seat going into the 2024 season. The Patriots signed Joey Slye to compete with Ryland. Slye was 22-for-30 from 40 yards and out for the Washington Commanders in 2022 and 2023. Slye has an 82.3 career accuracy percentage on field goals. He is 35-for-45 from 40-49 yards and 20-for-32 from 50-plus yards in his career. Ryland must improve from distance in order to keep his job, and if not, the Patriots could go with a veteran to ensure points in a season where a lot of field goals may be kicked with the offense being a work in progress.", "summary": "The quarterback competition will be the primary topic of the New England Patriots' preseason.

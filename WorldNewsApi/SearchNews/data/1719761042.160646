{"id": 225044230, "title": "I got a Mickey Mouse degree, minister \u2013 and what\u2019s wrong with that?", "text": "If I asked you to name the most useless degree you could think of, you\u2019d probably go for one of the old standbys: underwater basket weaving. A gendered perspective of interpretive dance. Journalism. Luckily for us, our esteemed government has finally decided to do away with the scourge of \u201cMickey Mouse degrees\u201d, so that future generations can focus on the things that really matter, like data management, and whatever a \u201cconsultant\u201d does. After all, why pursue your passions when you can make \u00a345k a year pretending to understand AI? Writing in The Telegraph, education secretary Gillian Keegan has promised to \u201coutlaw rip-off degrees\u201d to prevent students from being \u201clured on to courses that don\u2019t deliver the outcomes people deserve\u201d, preferring instead to champion apprenticeships. If you\u2019re wondering what constitutes a \u201crip-off degree\u201d, it appears the Tories don\u2019t know either. During an interview with Emma Barnett on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, Damian Hinds, minister of state for schools was unable to name any examples of courses which he would classify as a \u201crip-off\u201d, despite being asked directly three times. To be fair to Hinds, he said that he didn\u2019t want to single out any one university course \u2013 but, as Barnett pointed out, you can\u2019t use inflammatory language like \u201crip-off\u201d and then not expect people to be curious as to what qualifies. If anything, that ambiguity should worry us, since it invites the possibility that courses could be outlawed based on the whims of people who won\u2019t make the effort to understand them. I did what most people would probably classify as a \u201cMickey Mouse degree\u201d \u2013 actually, I did a few. I took Comparative Literature at BA \u2013 which is like English, except you don\u2019t read any authors people have heard of \u2013 and then I did the same at Masters level. I also did a PhD in women\u2019s poetry, which is what some cultures say when they don\u2019t have a word for \u201cunemployable\u201d. That being said, those so-called useless degrees helped me escape the council estate I grew up on, and now I work as an editor and columnist for a national newspaper. It hasn\u2019t been an easy road by any means, but it certainly wasn\u2019t hindered in any way by studying subjects that the likes of Gillian Keegan would scoff at. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until I got to university that things really started to click for me \u2013 not necessarily because of the specifics of the course I was on, but because the university system as a whole helps you to think about things in a different way. Contrary to what this policy suggests, the point of a degree isn\u2019t to train you how to do a specific job, or even to work in a specific industry \u2013 that\u2019s what apprenticeships are for. Rather, degrees are designed to cultivate a variety of essential skills that can be applied to a number of different sectors. Your degree might say \u201cArt History\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re limited to working in a museum or gallery once you graduate (in this economy you\u2019d be lucky to get a job in either). During the course of your education you learn how to write, how to analyse sources, how to complete projects, how to present in front of group, how to synthesise and evaluate information, how to use technology to present data \u2013 all skills that will help you in a variety of industries, and which are sorely lacking in many of them (I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve work for a manager who couldn\u2019t send a coherent email). And this was something we used to understand, intuitively. It\u2019s why so many older people are confused that their grandchildren are still unable to find work despite having \u201ca degree\u201d \u2013 not \u201ca degree in business management\u201d, or \u201ca degree in economics\u201d \u2013 because they remember a time, not too long ago, when the fact that you had completed a degree at all was enough for a potential employer to see that you were a cut above other potential applicants. The fact is, if people are struggling to land jobs with their so-called \u201cMickey Mouse degrees\u201d, that\u2019s a direct result of 14 years of poor management of the economy, and a flagging job market, brough to you by the same party which is now trying to pin the blame on hard-working educators. What a surprise that the people who gave us \u201cwe\u2019re sick of experts\u201d would try to pawn their own incompetence off on people who have dedicated their lives to a field of study. Of course, one of the biggest arguments against \u201clow-value\u201d degrees comes down to the issue of money. You don\u2019t want to spend close to 10k a year if you aren\u2019t going to make that money back down the line. But whose fault is that? Of course people are going to be put off going to university if the price is too high \u2013 we said as much back in 2012, when you tripled the cap on university fees and made the prospect of university education even more remote for working class kids. Talking about the \u201cvalue of education\u201d in financial terms completely ignores the simple fact that education is valuable in and of itself. That\u2019s something we should be focusing on, rather than demonising certain subjects because they don\u2019t fit our specific definition of what it means to be \u201cproductive\u201d. Our higher education sector is already a shambles due to this exact kind of corporatisation \u2013 bastardising it even further isn\u2019t going to help anybody. In putting forth this policy, the education secretary suggests that she doesn\u2019t understand the sector over which she presides. Maybe she could stand to learn a thing or two.", "summary": "<p>The point of going to university isn\u2019t just to make money, writes former teacher Ryan Coogan.

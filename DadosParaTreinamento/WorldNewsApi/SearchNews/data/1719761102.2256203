{"id": 225047026, "title": "Injury update given on Man United's Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as early England meet-up explained", "text": "England manager Gareth Southgate has confirmed that Manchester United duo Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw have linked up with the national team early to work with the medical staff ahead of the European Championship. Maguire missed Saturday's FA Cup final victory at Wembley meaning he missed United's last four games of the season because of a muscle injury. He last played on April 27 against Burnley. Shaw has been sidelined since mid-February with a muscle problem of his own. He suffered a setback in the latter stages of the campaign, ruling him out of the clash with Manchester City, meaning he played just 15 times this season.

The England boss will cut his 33-man squad down to 26 following next week's friendlies against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland. Maguire is understood to be much closer to playing a key role for the Three Lions than Shaw, with Southgate admitting last week it would be a \"long shot\" for him to play his part. However, in a bid to be as ready as they can for the tournament, both have reported to St. George's Park ahead of schedule. Southgate said: \"Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire have had injuries at the end of the season with United, so they needed a little bit more work with our medical team. But I think they are both hugely committed to trying to be fit for the tournament and they realise that every day is important. \"We are now getting the chance to see exactly where they are. That is the key at this time of the season; we get information from the clubs, but until you see the players in front of you, the medics can get their hands on them and we can see them on the grass, we then have a much clearer picture.\" Shaw and Maguire have been joined in the provisional squad by United teammate Kobbie Mainoo. He has enjoyed a sharp rise this season and is expected to make the final 26-man squad. \"The curious thing about young talent is how will they cope under pressure,\" Southgate added. \"You can see technical ability and everyone can see that. \"Then it is about how tactically aware, how mature and their ability to cope with big matches. But when you are playing for a club like Manchester United, you are always under the spotlight, so he has shown that with them and with us in March. \"We have never been afraid to put young players in; if players are good enough, we are not so concerned about their age. It is helpful to have more evidence when you are making decisions on players. \"Kobbie has had an amazing season, has really adjusted well and it is fabulous for him to finish the season with a goal and a trophy at the end of it.\"", "summary": "Man United duo Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw hope to play key roles for England at the European Championship this summer.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/injury-update-given-man-uniteds-29258240", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29258321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1443262730.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:10:08", "author": "George Smith", "authors": ["George Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.158}

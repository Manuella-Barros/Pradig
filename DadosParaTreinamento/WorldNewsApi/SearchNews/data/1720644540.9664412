You know I've been around for a long time, and you are the best. Thank you for all the work you've done here,\" Sajak replied.Sajak also warned fans in the episode recorded in April that his final show would look different from other episodes, because the game would be cut short so he could deliver a farewell message at the end.\"We're going to cut out a round, which kind of robs you people,'\" Sajak told the day's three contestants. \"Here's what I've decided. It's been a long time since I spun the wheel. I'm going to spin it, and I'm going to add $1,000 to whatever I land on and everyone's going to get that amount.\"He spun the wheel which landed on $1,000, but he was feeling generous and upped the amount to $5,000.\"You know what? It's not my money. Let's give them all $5,000,\" Sajak said.Pat Sajak's Farewell SpeechAt the end of the episode he turned to the camera to give his goodbyes.\"Well, the time has come to say goodbye,\" he said. \"I have a few thanks and acknowledgments before I go, and I want to start with all watching out there. It's been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes night after night, year after year, decade after decade.\"I've always felt that the privilege came with the responsibility to keep this daily half-hour a safe place for family fun. No social issues, no politics, nothing embarrassing, I hope, just a game.\"Sajak continued: \"But gradually it became more than that.\"A place where kids learned their letters, where people from other countries honed their English skills, where families came together along with friends and neighbors and entire generations.\"\"What an honor to play even a small part in all of that,\" Sajak concluded. \"Thank you for allowing me into your lives. Every time we taped a show, I met three new people from all parts of this wonderful country and the world who were kind and considerate, who rooted for each other, who took great pride in talking about their family, their hometown, their friends, their schools, their jobs, even their pets.\"In the end, they were the real stars of this show. I genuinely like these people, and I'll miss the chance to meet more of them.\"Sajak then turned his attention to the cast and crew of Wheel of Fortune.\"To our staff and crew, particularly the veterans with whom I've shared this stage for five years, ten years, 20, 30, and more. It's been a joy working with you. Your skills and dedication and good humor made this place somewhere I've always wanted to be,\" he said. \"Everyone pulled together and cared about each other and this show. It worked because you made it work. It looked great because you made it look great. And you made my job so much easier.\"I want you to know that your efforts never went unnoticed by me, nor unappreciated. I'll miss you guys.\"He also spoke of being able to work with his daughter Maggie Sajak who joined the show as a behind-the-scenes presenter.\"To watch her grow in her role and as a person. She interviewed me recently, and I talked about my life and the show. I hope you've seen some of it online. I really enjoyed doing it. I have to admit, it's a little weird to be interviewed by your own daughter, but she did a good job,\" Sajak said.\"Maggie is liked around here because she's talented and smart and funny, but she's loved around here because she's kind and caring and humble. Leslie and I are blessed to have two such wonderful kids,\" Sajak said. \"There's Maggie, of course, and her fabulous brother, Patrick, and his new family. As for Leslie, she's been my wife and life partner for 35 years. I love her for who she is and what we are as a team.\"Last but not least, Sajak took the time to acknowledge his \"professional other half,\" co-host Vanna White.\"Like me, she takes the show very seriously, but not herself. I shudder to think what these 40-plus years might have been like had they brought someone in all full of themselves, playing the prima donna role,\" Sajak said. \"Vanna is as sweet and unassuming as she seems. We've seen a lot of changes in each other's lives over the years, but we've always been there for each other.\"\"While I'll very much miss working with her, I take solace in the fact that we live about 5 miles apart, so we'll see plenty of each other,\" he said. \"But I will miss our nightly closes and her laughter and her good nature. She is a very special woman.\"\"That's it. Thank you all so very much and goodbye,\" Sajak concluded.", "summary": "Sajak hosted the daily game show since 1981 and thanked his 'professional work wife' Vanna White in his speech.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/pat-sajak-wheel-fortune-goodbye-retired-1909986", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406271/pat-sajak-vanna-white-smiling.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:34:40", "author": "Shannon Power", "authors": ["Shannon Power"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.559}

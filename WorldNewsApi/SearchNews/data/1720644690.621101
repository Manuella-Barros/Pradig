Changes ahead for two longtime downtown Windsor bars", "text": "But he feels he may have no choice. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because it\u2019s places like Phog and Craft Heads that create the fabric of downtown,\u201d said Rino Bortolin, who represented Windsor\u2019s downtown Ward 3 for eight years. \u201cThere are so many great aspects to these places and the cultural fabric that they create. \u201cThose are the bigger blows to downtown when you start to lose those places that make it special.\u201d Within the past year, a slew of established downtown businesses shuttered. Side Bar, a long-standing cocktail bar which opened in 2008, closed after irreparable water damage to their building. La Vern\u2019s Market, located in the same building, also shut its doors. When it opened in 2021, La Vern\u2019s was heralded as the type of business the downtown needed to attract new residents. The boutique grocery store\u2019s closing was preceded by the shutting down of The Manchester Pub and Dugout Sports Lounge. As part of the ebb and flow of business, however, other places have launched, such as: Republic, a high-end Asian fusion restaurant, and Hot Tacos, while The Cherry rock bar will open soon. MacLeod said he tries to \u201cfocus on the positive\u201d and is encouraged by new businesses opening downtown. \u201cFor Phog and Craft Heads, I hope that they are able to find a pathway forward, because I really believe that 12 to 24 months from now, it\u2019s going to be a very different environment downtown than it is today,\u201d said MacLeod. \u201cThat\u2019s because of the initiatives that have been started by the city.\u201d", "summary": "Barely a month after the city unveiled a seven-part plan to revive downtown Windsor, the owners of two of its longest-standing establishments are unsure if they&#8217;ll stick around. Changes loom for Craft Heads Brewing Company and Phog Lounge \u2014 fixtures of downtown&#8217;s music and arts community for 10 and 20 years, respectively. Both face rent [&#8230;]", "url": "https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/sign-of-the-times-changes-ahead-for-two-longtime-downtown-windsor-bars", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/windsorstar/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/phoglounge2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:39:43", "author": "Madeline Mazak", "authors": ["Madeline Mazak"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.184}

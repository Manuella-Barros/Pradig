Osonwa said the outrageous bill was given to his constituents, despite the fact that there has been no power supply to Ohafia for more than five years. The House of Representatives member who stated this in Umuahia while briefing Journalists on his one year in the green chambers said he has taken steps to resolve the crazy bill palaver among other achievements. He advised the Federal government to revoke the operational license of any power company that fails to provide electricity, saying that poor power supply is responsible for Nigeria's economic crises. The lawmaker who lamented the recent killing of a woman in her constituency of Isu community by alleged invaders from Ukwa, Cross River State, said he has collaborated with the Abia State government and security agencies to return calm to the troubled area. Osonwa who said he has moved a bill in the National Assembly for the conversion of Ohafia General Hospital to Federal Medical Centre, also said that gully erosion menace, bad roads and collapsing bridges in his constituency are to be fixed. On minimum wage demand by the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, the lawmaker said the N400,000 demand by the organized labour is unrealistic even as he opined that the workers should be paid N100,000 as a living wage. He used the occasion to say that the members of the National Assembly are not collecting jumbo salaries, saying that those accusing them of being insensitive to the plight of Nigerian workers are only being unfair to the legislators.", "summary": "<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ibe-Okwara-Osonwa.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ibe-Okwara-Osonwa.jpg 1920w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ibe-Okwara-Osonwa-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ibe-Okwara-Osonwa-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ibe-Okwara-Osonwa-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /><p>The member representing Arochukwu, Ohafia federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Ibe Okwara Osonwa has raised alarm that the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company, EEDC, has presented an electricity bill of N2.1 billion naira to the people of Ohafia.

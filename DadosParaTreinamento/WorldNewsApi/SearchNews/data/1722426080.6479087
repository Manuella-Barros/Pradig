While the Wasp has the capability to assist in the evacuation of civilians if full-scale war breaks out between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group along the Lebanon border, that\u2019s not the primary reason it was rotated in, a US official said. \u201cIt\u2019s about deterrence,\u201d the official said. A second US official said the rotation is similar to the US sending the USS Bataan assault ship into the waters around Israel shortly after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack, with the vessel remaining for months in the eastern Mediterranean to help provide options and try to contain the conflict. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operational details. US officials said last week that the deployment of the Wasp was likely as the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower,aircraft carrier and its air wing left the region.", "summary": "The USS Wasp has the capability to assist in the evacuation of civilians if full-scale war breaks out between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/world/middle-east/deterrence-us-moves-ship-towards-israel-lebanon-conflict-20240629-p5jpru.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1226%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_55/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/3bde902e50f253cf95db117c7679c52ff9abb4aa", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:10:41", "author": "Tara Copp", "authors": ["Tara Copp"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.24}

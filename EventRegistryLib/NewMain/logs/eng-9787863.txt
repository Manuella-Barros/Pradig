In the biographies for the gymnasts, who compete in Saturday's men's pommel final, Rhys McClenaghan is asked about ambitions. His answer is one line.\n\n\"Landing on top of the podium at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe answer could have been taken from Tokyo 2020. On Saturday night, in the Bercy Arena, McClenaghan is chasing an ambition that was alive three years ago and perished on one mistake in the final.\n\nA missed hand position and fall pushed him down the field into seventh place. He left Tokyo chastened but also stoic and determined. The Olympic Games, the damned Olympics, had struck again.\n\nBecause of Covid it has been a three-year wait, not four, for the Olympic cycle to continue. McClenaghan has thrillingly pushed on and in 2022 became world champion in Liverpool. A year later he successfully defended his world title in Antwerp.\n\nIn October of that year he told The Irish Times: \"Many athletes would agree it's probably more difficult to retain a title than it is to get it in the first place. Because you've got a target on your back.\"\n\nWell, he didn't win an Olympic medal in Tokyo but as a two-time World Champion coming into Paris, McClenaghan is the man to beat.\n\nAfter confidently qualifying a week ago for the eight-man final, McClenaghan is ranked number one with his score of 15.200. He seems acutely aware of his place in the gymnastic firmament, conscious enough at least to state in public where he is in his own head about the prospects of fulfilling the ambition that failure in Tokyo has sharpened.\n\n\"I'm at the top of the mountain now, and I'm just enjoying the view,\" the 25 year old said after qualifying for the final. \"It could be better, but it was solid. That was the word Luke [Carson, his coach] was using when I came off. It was calm. That's what you want to be like in that reappearance at the Olympic Games, and that's what it did feel like.\n\n\"But of course, I want to be pushing more and more to that perfection that isn't attainable. But we'll try.\"\n\nEven after his impressive qualification at the top of a 65-strong field, McClenaghan and Carson had not decided what routine they would use in the final. Those in the know say the pommel closely relates to the balance beam in women's gymnastics because there remains a fearful sense the athletes might not make it through to the end of the routine - as McClenaghan painfully demonstrated three years ago before he was 10 seconds in. Completion is the first rung on the ladder of success.\n\nIn essence it is about mental and physical agility, where muscle memory is key. It is also a truism of the sport that if the athlete tries to memorise the moves in sequence, he is toast before he vaults on to the pommel. It needs to be ingrained.\n\nThere is also the endurance, rhythm and precision required to not touch the apparatus as the legs \"flare\" from side to side over the 45 seconds or so. The scoring comes down to execution and difficulty with the athlete deciding before he competes on how far he wants to push the difficulty element of the routine.\n\nIt is a risk/reward settlement McClenaghan will agree with himself and his team as well as an expression of self-belief. To set the routine at a dizzy Olympic gold medal-winning level of difficulty is not within the ability of every athlete. For McClenaghan it is. Saturday's final performance will not be the same as the one that got him to the Bercy Arena.\n\n\"It is different,\" said McClenaghan last week on his planned final routine. \"I can upgrade and I plan to upgrade. Hopefully we'll be seeing that score bumped up even further. It felt so familiar out there, that pressure I have on my shoulders, because I do it every day in training. I don't know what score it will take to win, and I don't care, as I have my job to do and I am hopefully going to do it.\"\n\nIt would be remiss to believe he has a straight run to the podium. In Tokyo the title went to an opponent he knows well, Great Britain's Max Whitlock, a three-time Olympic champion, who has won the Olympic title once in the floor routine and twice on the pommel. In Tokyo Whitlock became the first man in more than 40 years to defend a pommel horse gold medal.\n\nReversing his decision to retire after Tokyo, he announced Paris would be his fourth and final Games. And Whitlock duly made his presence felt in qualifying as one of five athletes to score over 15 points.\n\nMcClenaghan knows his way around the game of margins as well as the personalities of Whitlock and the other top qualifiers, Japan's Takaaki Sugino (15.033), Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev (15.033), Kazakhstan's Nariman Kurbanov (15.000), Korea's Woong Hur (14.900), and Dutch gymnast Loran de Munck (14.760).\n\nHe is where he has always wanted to be, from when he travelled to London 12 years ago to watch the pommel competition as a teenage fan. He told the BBC about how he deeply admired how British silver medal winner Louis Smith performed under the weight of his home crowd.\n\n\"I saw the amount of pressure that was on that man's shoulders and to see him presenting to the judges and performing a routine like he always did in training, that for me was so admirable,\" he told Nigel Ringland. \"It's a little moment that I'll never forget, that inspired me until this point. My whole career is filled with moments like that, moments of surreal, dreamlike fantasies that I've had growing up, to be competing against Louis.\"\n\nOn Saturday night, there are no fantasies. It's just McClenaghan and the weight of the expectations he has heaped on himself. Already a two-time world champion and three-time European champion, he is regarded as one of the greats. But it is still not enough for McClenaghan. He will go into the Bercy Arena chasing perfection.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "johnny_watterson@irishtimes.com",

It sounds like a dream come true,\" McClenaghan said.\n\n\"It still feels like a dream. But it's a lifetime of work culminating into one little moment, and this little moment is what you are seeing right now.\"\n\nIn complete contrast to the noise that surrounded Simone Biles' stunning gold in the women's vault half an hour earlier, you could almost hear a pin drop as the gymnasts took to the pommel horse.\n\nMcClenaghan looked laser-focused as he waited to be called to his apparatus, knowing that he was the man to beat after qualifying in first position.\n\nIt had been billed as a McClenaghan v Max Whitlock final, but Kazakhstan's Nariman Kurbanov laid down an early marker with a 15.433.\n\nThen the Newtownards gymnast did not look up once as his Team GB rival - second in line - completed his routine.\n\nBut Whitlock could not score higher than Kurbanov. That wasn't in the script as the two-time pommel horse gold medal winner made his Olympic farewell.\n\nThen, in any gymnast's biggest fear, Loran de Munck made a mistake right before McClenaghan's run, something he witnessed unfold as he ran his routine through his mind.\n\nThree years ago in Tokyo, it was McClenaghan who made a mistake when it mattered most as his medal chance slipped away.\n\nIn Paris on Saturday, those ghosts were well and truly banished.\n\nMcClenaghan produced a flawless routine. His coach, and friend, Luke Carson watched on and had his head in his hands just before McClenaghan dismounted.\n\nHe knew what was about to come if it was a clean landing - and it was.\n\nThe arena erupted and McClenaghan let out a huge roar before hugging Carson, his coach since he was 14.\n\nHe admits the biggest emotion was \"relief\" after completing \"the most difficult routine I could do\".\n\n\"That's where the tears and emotions came from, really.\n\n\"Relief is always the one when you land the dismount. I didn't know that I had won as soon as I landed.\"\n\nThe score of 15.533 rewarded his sensational routine.\n\nIt was still a nervous wait as the popular American, Stephen Nedoroscik, still had to perform at the Bercy Arena.\n\nIt was a strong attempt, but Nedoroscik could only slot into third place.\n\nThen, when final gymnast Hur Woong fell off the pommel horse the job was done - McClenaghan was champion.\n\n\"I was saying to Stephen, that this is the best pommel horse final ever, in the history of men's gymnastics,\" McClenaghan added.\n\n\"To be a part of that is absolutely incredible.\n\n\"Any of the eight finalists could have taken gold today.\"\n\nMcClenaghan has now completed what is considered gymnastics' 'Grand Slam' - World, European, Commonwealth and Olympic gold.\n\n\"I started to look around the arena when I'd finished competing and when I was looking around that arena after my pommel routine, and I'd scored a personal best score, the emotions were through the roof.\n\n\"I was incredibly proud to do all of the Irish fans here proud today and create history for the country.\"\n\nGiven the expectation and pressure he has had to deal with, McClenaghan could have easily crumbled.\n\nBut his resilience was on full display, and the emotions kept on coming as he stood on the top step of the podium to collect his gold medal.\n\nHe is the latest athlete from Northern Ireland to strike gold in a remarkable Olympics.\n\nPrior to these Games, there had only been three in history - there have already been four in Paris.\n\nHe is also Ireland's third gold medallist of the Games as he cements his place as one of the greats.\n\nThe hoards of support had stayed in the arena to share the historic moment with him as 'Zombie' by the Cranberries rang out.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself for doing it under that pressure. I was the double world champion coming into this,\" he added.\n\n\"It could be Ireland's first-ever gymnastics medal and I delivered under that pressure.\n\n\"Those are the emotions that you are seeing.

Fourth competitor, McClenaghan performed the routine of a lifetime, scoring 15:333.\n\nThat performance put McClenaghan into the lead. Next up was America's 2021 world champion Stephen Nedoroscik. Regarded as a big threat, scoring 15:300, leaving the Newtownards star in the lead with three to go.\n\nNone of the remaining three men scored over 15, which meant that the vaunted title of 'Olympic Champion' went to McClenaghan to see him realise his long held dream.\n\n\"No, I didn't know that I'd won as soon as I landed\" explained McClenaghan. \"But I knew that I had done my job.

To be a part of that is incredible and any one of those eight finalists could have taken gold today.\"\n\n\"I guess relief is always one when you land\" explained McClenaghan of his emotions. \"Proud of myself as well for doing it under that pressure\".\n\nMcClenaghan, has been coached to his success throughout by Luke Carson, has had a spectacular career littered with a series of ground breaking firsts.\n\nMcClenaghan was the first Irish gymnast to win a medal at a world championships (2019 bronze), first to make Olympic final (Tokyo 2020).\n\nFirst to win world (2022) and European (2023) championship titles, and then to retain them (2023 Worlds, 2024 Europeans).\n\nIt is fitting he will forever go down in history as the first Irish gymnast ever to win an Olympic medal.", "source": {"uri": "shannonside.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shannonside"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Kurbanov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Kurbanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Down", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Down"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2021", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2021"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/shannonside-ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvaW1nLnNoYW5ub25zaWRlLmllXFxcL3Byb2RcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yODE0NzYxLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9pbWFnZXMudW5zcGxhc2guY29tXFxcL3Bob3RvLTE1ODYzMzk5NDk5MTYtM2U5NDU3YmVmNmQzXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImIyODg4MzFiMDJhYzZlNmZiNDFkM2E2MzkxNGViYzIxOGQyMGYwZWYifQ==/rhys-mcclenaghan-wins-olympic-gold.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

But his flawless performance here reinforced all he achieved before, including winning back-to-back world titles.\n\nSuch is the Zen and the art of being Rhys McClenaghan.\n\nNariman Kurbanov from Kazakhstan was up first, the 26-year-old scoring 15.434 and laying down an early marker with his slowly soaring routine which clearly impressed the judges. It would be good enough to win him silver.\n\nThen came Max Whitlock, the 31-year-old British gymnast producing an amazing handstand mid routine, yet his score of 15.000 appeared to slightly disappoint. He would finish in fourth. Whitlock was seeking to become the first gymnast to win three pommel horse Olympic gold medals in a row, adding to those won in Rio and Tokyo.\n\nUp after McClenaghan was Stephen Nedoroscik, the 25-year-old from the US. The 2021 world champion's one-handed twists mid routine clearly impressed the judges too, but his score of 15.300 was not enough to trouble McClenaghan and it left him in third.\n\nSo McClenaghan also extends Ireland's Olympic medal record into a seventh sport - joining those won in athletics, boxing, swimming, sailing, rowing and equestrian.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Newtownards has only been growing in confidence since his Olympic quest fell short in Tokyo three years ago. All that was on display here with his routine perfectly executed under the circumstances.\n\nHe was back in the arena exactly seven days after confidently qualifying for the eight-man final ranked number one with his score of 15.200.\n\nSo far in Paris, Kellie Harrington is already guaranteed a bronze in lightweight boxing, and will look to upgrade that to silver or gold in her semi-final later on Saturday night.\n\nIn swimming, Daniel Wiffen has already won gold in the 800m freestyle and will go into the 1,500m final as overwhelming favourite. Mona McSharry took bronze in the 100m breaststroke, while rowers Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch won bronze in the men's doubles before Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy won their second gold in the lightweight double sculls.\n\nIreland's best Olympic medal record was the six won in the London in 2012, which has now been matched, with more to come, as early as Sunday and Wiffen's 1,500m final.\n\nLast Sunday week, McClenaghan celebrated his 25th birthday inside the Athletes' Village, saying he was already living his dream\n\nHe fully understands was this moment means in other ways too. His hopes of making the Olympic podium in Tokyo ended after 10 seconds when he fell chest-first on to the horse and ended up seventh.\n\n\"I'll be walking away from this a more dangerous man,\" he said in the aftermath of that moment. \"Because with disappointment comes an incredible amount of motivation and inspiration.\n\nSo, seven years ago after announcing his arrival at age 18, beating Whitlock to win gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, he adds to his eight championship medals in all (two world championship gold and one bronze, three European gold, plus Commonwealth Games gold and silver).\n\nIn the final event immediately before, Simone Biles captured another gold medal, this time in the women's vault final. It was her third gold medal of these Games after leading the USA to gold in the team final and winning gold in the all-around final.\n\nFor her career, it's Biles's seventh gold and 10th medal overall, extending her record of most Olympic medals by an American gymnast. Biles also won gold on vault at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nBut there can only ever be one first Olympic medal winner in gymnastics for Ireland.

It is a truly deserved honour for the drive and dedication he has shown throughout his career so far.\"\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris said in a statement: \"A massive congratulations to Rhys McClenaghan on becoming an Olympic champion. Our hearts pumped while watching your mesmerising performance.\n\n\"Your determination and precision have been top class and you are so deserving of this gold medal. Your journey to this Olympic medal has been nothing short of incredible. We are all so proud of you. I know having met you in Paris last week how much this means to you and your family.

It feels really good. It's a dream come true.

That plan developed and came to fruition today.\"\n\nIt was also a case of redemption for McClenaghan, who went into the Olympics in Tokyo three years ago with designs on at least finishing on the podium if not claiming gold then, but a mistake during his routine meant he finished a disappointing seventh.\n\nOn this occasion, however, there would be no denying him. Despite admitting there is always room for improvement, the newly crowned champion produced the best score he's ever recorded in a competition to bring home the gold.\n\n\"I started to look around the arena when I finished competing, and when I looked around the arena after I did my routine and scored my personal best score, my emotions were through the roof,\" added McClenaghan.\n\n\"I was incredibly proud to do all the Irish fans here proud and to create history for the country.\n\n\"I knew (winning gold) was possible.

Gavin Cooney reports from the Bercy Arena\n\nBENEATH THE CHALK-HAZY lights of the Bercy Arena, Loran de Munck planted his hand a fraction of an inch to the right of where it was meant to go, and so he slipped of the pommel horse and ended his own dreams.\n\nAnother nerve may have been knotted into Rhys McClenaghan.\n\nDe Munck had to remount to finish his routine, which meant finishing later than planned.\n\nMcClenaghan's pre-competition routine is always the same: he turns his back on the competitor immediately before him and instead visualises his routine.\n\nDe Munck wasn't going to medal but now he was meddling. McClenaghan had finished his visualisation and had turned to make his way to the stage.\n\nThe pommel horse final is purely about executing that which you practice to abnormal levels of precision. McClenaghan suddenly had the very first part of it thrown askew.\n\nDe Munck slunk away and McClenaghan was called forward. He slapped his hands on each of the pommels as his coach Luke Carson adjusted them to his height. He then stood adjacent and waited for his call over the arena PA system. Does it always take this long?\n\nGiven McClenaghan was announced as the reigning world champion, any neutral observers would have wondered why everyone back in Ireland was a fretting, tissue-frittering mess.\n\nBut that's because of Tokyo and the awesome weight freighted upon the Olympic Games. It's a cruel kind of caprice, but the rest of the world only truly pays attention during the Olympics. It comes around every four years and so it means it so much more. Too much, if we're honest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNariman Kurbanov of Kazakhstan went first and sent an early ripple across the arena, awarded a 15.433, which outstripped McClenaghan's qualifying score. Gulp.\n\nNext was two-time champion Max Whitlock, in his final appearance before retirement. Don't go doing something stupid like writing a perfect farewell for yourself now, Max. But Whitlock erred in means not truly accessible to the vast majority of us. A tiny adjustment before his dismount hurt him, as did the separation of his legs during his swing on the horse.\n\nOne of the iron laws of pommel horse: do not split your legs.\n\n\"Whenever you see a pommel horse worker splitting their legs, they're nervous\", explained McClenaghan after it was all over. \"They've felt something is off a little bit.\"\n\nIn training the routine earlier in the week, McClenaghan split his legs. Do it again and the Olympic gold would be going to somebody else.\n\nHe and his coach Luke Carson believed the routine they had been training could score 15.6. Do that and nobody in the field would live with him. Not Kurbanov, not Nedoroscik, not Whitlock, nor anybody else. McClenaghan is so good it's only about him and it's never about anyone else. How terrifying is that?\n\nThe key to that score is to make it damn difficult. Routines are scored by difficulty and by execution, and in the most elite field in gymnastics, everyone can execute. The greatest separate themselves by the scale of their ambition.\n\nThink for a moment on the sheer sporting audacity of this. McClenaghan was returning to the stage most likely to summon the ghosts of his fall off the horse in the Olympic final three years ago, and he was returning to banish them with a more difficult routine. The most difficult routine of his life.\n\nWhat does that say about you Rhys?\n\n\"It shows I've got balls.\"\n\nAnd so McClenaghan snapped up and atop the pommel to fill the next minute with every single inch of the life he led to that moment. He clutched his legs together and swung great, generous circles which resembled steady radar pulses to the thousands looking down upon him.\n\nHis hands then left the pommel and McClenaghan pat-pat-patted his way along the horse, continuing to swing in wide arcs while also somehow managing to rock forward and back.\n\nHis routine flowed at a brisk and mildly scary tempo, further separating him from his more staccato rivals The crowd's murmurs were evolving to shouts and cheers: they may not know the intricacies of the apparatus but they knew this looked good.\n\nBut still McClenaghan believed he needed more. Another ingredient of difficulty, another hostage to fortune, another chance for it all to go wrong. The added move is known as the Roth, named after the American gymnast, Bill Roth. It's effectively a full journey down the pommel horse while completing a trio of spins.\n\nIt's not the most difficult move in isolation, but to needlessly cram it in to the end of the biggest routine of your life as your muscles scream for sweet relief? That's the stuff that peels the best away from the best.\n\nMcClenaghan knew he might not need to do it. He could just junk it on the fly and finish safely without disaster, without a repeat of Tokyo. But that wouldn't guarantee the gold medal. The best must be audacious.\n\nAnd so McClenaghan completed his final journey down the horse flawlessly, before swinging his legs upwards to complete the handstand that comes before the dismount.

It was the highest ever score he achieved in competition.\n\nMcClenaghan shed tears when the score flashed up on the screen and the crowd went wild. Everybody knew that even though four gymnasts still had to complete their routine, McClenaghan was the Olympic champion.\n\nIt was his seventh gold medal including World, European and Commonwealth titles but this was by far the most significant, the one he wanted from the moment he committed himself to the sport in his teenage years.\n\nNariman Kurbanov from Kazakhstan who was the first finalist to tackle the pommel horse set an extraordinary high standard with a score of 15.434 consisting of 6.7 for difficult and 8.7 for execution.\n\nIn his final ever Pommel horse event, Whitlock's bid for gold ended with a score of 15.3.\n\nThe Netherlands' Loran de Munck fell off the horse which ended his ambitions. McClenaghan was next and after a short break American Stephen Nedoroscik was the only serious threat remaining.\n\nHe did exceptionally well with a score of 15.33 which it didn't dislodge the Irishman though it was good enough to earn him the bronze medal with Kurbanov taking the silver.\n\nAfter his nightmare in Tokyo three years this was redemption for McClenaghan. His life's ambition achieved at the age of 25.\n\nSpeaking afterwards a beaming McClenaghan reflected on the enormity of the achievement: \"It feels like a dream, it's a dream well-earned and I just can't believe it's happened! It always felt like it was going to happen but I wasn't sure when.\n\n\"Listen everybody at home see this as an example of find a dream that you love, chase it and enjoy that journey because I can tell you if I fell off that Pommel today I still would have loved this journey, every single second of it but I didn't and today I'm walking away with an Olympic gold medal!\"\n\n\"After the routine I was happy - I wasn't thinking about medals. When the score came up I was proud of that score because it was mine and I wasn't thinking of the podium at all I was just thinking I've done my job and I feel like that's where the main emotions came from today.\n\n\"I knew that this would also be the toughest pommel horse final of all time, and it was so to come out on top is incredible.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Kurbanov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Kurbanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Cooney reports from the Bercy Arena\n\nThe 42 Editor's note: This article by Gavin Cooney forms part of The 42's subscriber-only coverage of the Paris 2024 Olympics, with unique insights and fresh perspectives on the biggest stories every single day. If you'd enjoy more great sportswriting like this, you can sign up here for a free one-month trial to The 42.\n\nBENEATH THE CHALK-HAZY lights of the Bercy Arena, Loran de Munck planted his hand a fraction of an inch to the right of where it was meant to go, and so he slipped of the pommel horse and ended his own dreams.\n\nAnother nerve may have been knotted into Rhys McClenaghan.\n\nDe Munck had to remount to finish his routine, which meant finishing later than planned.\n\nMcClenaghan's pre-competition routine is always the same: he turns his back on the competitor immediately before him and instead visualises his routine.\n\nDe Munck wasn't going to medal but now he was meddling. McClenaghan had finished his visualisation and had turned to make his way to the stage.\n\nThe pommel horse final is purely about executing that which you practice to abnormal levels of precision. McClenaghan suddenly had the very first part of it thrown askew.\n\nDe Munck slunk away and McClenaghan was called forward. He slapped his hands on each of the pommels as his coach Luke Carson adjusted them to his height. He then stood adjacent and waited for his call over the arena PA system. Does it always take this long?\n\nGiven McClenaghan was announced as the reigning world champion, any neutral observers would have wondered why everyone back in Ireland was a fretting, tissue-frittering mess.\n\nBut that's because of Tokyo and the awesome weight freighted upon the Olympic Games. It's a cruel kind of caprice, but the rest of the world only truly pays attention during the Olympics. It comes around every four years and so it means it so much more. Too much, if we're honest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNariman Kurbanov of Kazakhstan went first and sent an early ripple across the arena, awarded a 15.433, which outstripped McClenaghan's qualifying score. Gulp.\n\nNext was two-time champion Max Whitlock, in his final appearance before retirement. Don't go doing something stupid like writing a perfect farewell for yourself now, Max. But Whitlock erred in means not truly accessible to the vast majority of us. A tiny adjustment before his dismount hurt him, as did the separation of his legs during his swing on the horse.\n\nOne of the iron laws of pommel horse: do not split your legs.\n\n\"Whenever you see a pommel horse worker splitting their legs, they're nervous\", explained McClenaghan after it was all over. \"They've felt something is off a little bit.\"\n\nIn training the routine earlier in the week, McClenaghan split his legs. Do it again and the Olympic gold would be going to somebody else.\n\nHe and his coach Luke Carson believed the routine they had been training could score 15.6. Do that and nobody in the field would live with him. Not Kurbanov, not Nedoroscik, not Whitlock, nor anybody else. McClenaghan is so good it's only about him and it's never about anyone else. How terrifying is that?\n\nThe key to that score is to make it damn difficult. Routines are scored by difficulty and by execution, and in the most elite field in gymnastics, everyone can execute. The greatest separate themselves by the scale of their ambition.\n\nThink for a moment on the sheer sporting audacity of this. McClenaghan was returning to the stage most likely to summon the ghosts of his fall off the horse in the Olympic final three years ago, and he was returning to banish them with a more difficult routine. The most difficult routine of his life.\n\nWhat does that say about you Rhys?\n\n\"It shows I've got balls.\"\n\nAnd so McClenaghan snapped up and atop the pommel to fill the next minute with every single inch of the life he led to that moment. He clutched his legs together and swung great, generous circles which resembled steady radar pulses to the thousands looking down upon him.\n\nHis hands then left the pommel and McClenaghan pat-pat-patted his way along the horse, continuing to swing in wide arcs while also somehow managing to rock forward and back.\n\nRead Next Related Reads An overnight success years in the making - How Irish swimming became an Olympic force 'It's hands on wall first': The most important 0.01 seconds of Mona McSharry's career\n\nHis routine flowed at a brisk and mildly scary tempo, further separating him from his more staccato rivals. The crowd's murmurs were evolving to shouts and cheers: they may not know the intricacies of the apparatus but they knew this looked good.\n\nBut still McClenaghan believed he needed more. Another ingredient of difficulty, another hostage to fortune, another chance for it all to go wrong. The added move is known as the Roth, named after the American gymnast, Bill Roth. It's effectively a full journey down the pommel horse while completing a trio of spins.\n\nIt's not the most difficult move in isolation, but to needlessly cram it in to the end of the biggest routine of your life as your muscles scream for sweet relief? That's the stuff that peels the best away from the best.\n\nMcClenaghan knew he might not need to do it. He could just junk it on the fly and finish safely without disaster, without a repeat of Tokyo. But that wouldn't guarantee the gold medal. The best must be audacious.\n\nAnd so McClenaghan completed his final journey down the horse flawlessly, before swinging his legs upwards to complete the handstand that comes before the dismount. The split second it took for his feet to point directly at the sky was long enough for everyone in the arena to realise that Rhys McClenaghan had run his gauntlet and come through without a scratch.\n\nHis feet then hit the floor and the pressure and the tension of the last three years burst forth and set sail.\n\nIt was at that point the rest of us knew.\n\nRhys McClenaghan had done what he had come to do.\n\nWritten by Gavin Cooney and originally published on The 42 whose award-winning team produces original content that you won't find anywhere else: on GAA, League of Ireland, women's sport and boxing, as well as our game-changing rugby coverage, all with an Irish eye.

Full list for day 8 in Paris\n\nREAD MORE: What time is gymnast Rhys McClenaghan going for Olympic gold today?\n\nThroughout his life, he has projected his fantasies towards today. \"I always had some sort of drive and vision of greatness,\" he once said. \"If it was a swimming gala I was at, I pictured myself at the Olympic Games. Leaping through the air at gymnastics, it was the same image I had of myself.\"\n\nIrish people aren't meant to be as confident as this fella, not outwardly anyway. We're meant to be awkward and self-deprecating. McClenaghan, from Newtownards, Co. Down is different. \"I truly believe I can do it,\" McClenaghan says.\n\nIt was his parents who taught him from an early age to have belief.\n\nHe showed that when he left the youth for the senior ranks when he was still a teenager, appreciating that the people he idolised had to cease to become heroes and instead turn into rivals.\n\nMax Whitlock (31), who was third behind Rhys in qualifying, was his big hero.\n\nNow the British star is his big adversary, Whitlock becoming the first man in more than 40 years to retain the Olympic pommel title and he is looking to make further history as the first artistic gymnast to win medals at four Games.\n\nHe isn't the only person blocking Rhys's path to the podium.\n\nJapan's Takaaki Sugino, Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev, and Kazakstan's Nariman Kurbanov also scored 15 points in qualifying, the pommel's equivalent of the 10-second mark in the 100m sprint. Anything above 10 seconds is considered average in that sport, anything below 15 points considered poor in pommel.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, McClenaghan qualified in joint second and then disaster struck in the final. A fall. A low score. A seventh place finish. A time for reflection.\n\nHe has come back stronger, the five Olympic rings tattooed onto his arm, the idea of becoming a champion imprinted onto his conscience.\n\nHe remembers his breakthrough moment. 2019, finishing third in the world championships, realising he was going to Tokyo.\n\nThat night he phoned home to tell his mother, Tracey, that he had qualified. Neither mother nor son could speak for the tears. \"It was almost like a near-death experience,\" he said.\n\nThose tears stemmed from a devotion to the sport.\n\nWhen he was eight-years-old, he came out of a gymnastics class, and listened to his schedule for the week. Football, swimming, gymnastics. There was a clash. At eight he had to choose between sports. Gymnastics won.\n\nAt times he wondered about the choice. Gym days could be hard; the school playground harder. Kids would abuse him for wearing a leotard. He stood his ground.\n\nBecause nothing in this world has energised him like the feeling he gets when he flies through the air and does a double somersault.\n\nBut this afternoon in Paris - a better feeling may arrive.

Everything you need to know about the Olympic gymnast", "body": "The Co Down man is the first ever Irish gymnast to qualify for two finals at two consecutive Olympic Games, following on from his performance in Tokyo in 2022 - where he was also the first Irish gymnast to qualify for an Olympic final.\n\nHe came first in last week's pommel horse subdivision 3, finishing with a score of 15.200.\n\nMcClenaghan could very well bring home a medal for Team Ireland. Here's everything you need to know about him.\n\nRhys McClenaghan is 25 years old, having celebrated his birthday just days before the Olympics began on July 21.\n\nHe is from Newtownards in Co Down and trained in Rathgael Gymnastics Club in Bangor until his coach was made redundant in 2018.\n\nFollowing this, McClenaghan was forced to train in his back garden before relocating to Dublin. He received funding and accommodation from Gymnastics Ireland and Sport Ireland to train in their institute in Abbotstown.\n\nThe artistic gymnast competes internationally for both Ireland and Northern Ireland. His first major win was in 2016 when he was still technically a minor at the British Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He won a bronze medal, coming third to Olympians Louis Smith and Max Whitlock.\n\nMcClenaghan's speciality is the pommel horse and he is considered to be one of the best pommel workers of his generation.\n\nIn 2018, he won a gold medal on the pommel horse for Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games. Months later, he also won the European championship.\n\nThe following year, the Co Down man was the first Irish gymnast to qualify for a world championships final and to take home a medal, following his bronze medal performance on the pommel horse.\n\nMcClenaghan is a double world champion, having won gold on the pommel horse in 2022 and 2023. He is the first Irish artistic gymnast ever to win world championship gold.\n\nLast year, he won a second European title and retained the world title.\n\nAhead of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, McClenaghan was banned from competing for Northern Ireland by the International Gymnastics Foundation, along with two other gymnasts, Eamon Montgomery and Ewan McAteer.\n\nThis was due to the fact that he had previously competed in international competitions for Ireland.\n\nThe foundation called on the men to change their nationality from Irish on their licenses. Alternatively, they suggested that the Commonwealth Games Federation remove the relevant gymnastics competitions from the foundation's calendar.\n\nThen taoiseach Leo Varadkar was among politicians who criticised the decision.\n\nCommonwealth Games NI even accused the foundation of \"completely disregarding\" the Good Friday Agreement in their decision.\n\nEventually, McClenaghan, Montgomery and McAteer were given a special dispensation to compete in the games.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_daly@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Rebecca Daly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Down", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County Down"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangor,_County_Down", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangor, County Down"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangor, County Down"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Smith_(gymnast)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louis Smith (gymnast)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2022 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Varadkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leo Varadkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8463/4231867_6_articlelarge_2.76970424.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 545, "textEnd": 552}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

McClenaghan again balancing his incredibly cool nerve and towering ambition with another dazzling display on the pommel horse - Zen-like in execution, and also devastatingly good. His best routine ever. It needed to be.\n\nHe now stands as the first Irish Olympic medal winner in gymnastics.\n\nRonnie Delany once described destiny as knowing something about yourself that no one else does. Before joining him in that great sporting pantheon as the 11th Irish Olympic champion, McClenaghan had shared his destiny with one other person - his coach Luke Carson.\n\nTogether they drew up a 10-year plan that would have McClenaghan at the peak of his powers by 2024.\n\nSo it came to be. It was just before 6pm local time when the 25-year-old from Newtownards took centre stage for his routine, up fourth of the eight finalists. A flawless 47-second routine later - McClenaghan channelling every ounce of strength and skill and agility built up over that same decade - his score of 15.533 would be enough to seal the gold.\n\nAfter he dismounted McClenaghan raised both arms in triumph and afforded himself a shout of relief, then briefly put his head in his hands as it all started to sink it. Then he embraced Carson.\n\n\"It was hard to make it seem realistic back then, but we saw a path,\" McClenaghan said of their combined goal.\n\n\"Luke clearly saw a path. It's not often I've heard him say, 'I think this kid can be a world champion', but he said it for me. I owe Luke a lot. This is our medal, and I'm proud it's that way.\n\n\"I just think it has been part of this plan, part of what we've been aiming for so many years, since I started training with Luke. You know, that's 10 years ago, and when I started with him, there was a 10-year plan to win an Olympic gold medal.\"\n\nShortly after his routine, McClenaghan was standing on top of the medal podium, Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann being played out for the first time ever inside an Olympic gymnastics arena. That's when the tears of joy started to fall.\n\n\"It feels like a dream, it's a dream well-earned and I just can't believe it's happened,\" he said later.\n\n\"It always felt like it was going to happen but I wasn't sure when. I didn't know that I'd won when I landed, but I knew that I'd done my job. I knew I went through my most difficult routine that I could do on this day. And that's where the tears and emotions came from, really.\"\n\nNariman Kurbanov from Kazakhstan was up first, the 26-year-old scoring 15.434 and laying down an early marker with his slowly soaring routine which clearly impressed the judges. It would be good enough to win him silver.\n\nThen came Max Whitlock, the 31-year-old British gymnast producing an amazing handstand mid routine, yet his score of 15.000 appeared to slightly disappoint. He would finish in fourth. Whitlock was seeking to become the first gymnast to win three pommel horse Olympic gold medals in a row, adding to those won in Rio and Tokyo.\n\nUp after McClenaghan was Stephen Nedoroscik, the 25-year-old from the US. The 2021 world champion's one-handed twists mid routine impressed the judges too, but his score of 15.300 was not enough to trouble McClenaghan and it left him in third.\n\n\"I literally dreamed that I scored 15.5,\" he said, \"but I never dreamed that I've won, which is weird, but I'm not one to look into dreams like that.\n\n\"There's the tiniest little hesitation during that routine where you can either go for the difficult skill towards the end of the routine, or you don't, and do the routine I've done in qualifications. That would have been a 15.2. So, yeah, I had to suck it up, I had to get it done, put that new skill in, and it worked out because I came away with a personal best score. And, yeah, I can't ask for more than that.\"\n\nMcClenaghan's hopes of making the Olympic podium in Tokyo ended after 10 seconds when he fell chest-first on to the horse and ended up seventh. There were no tears on that occasion, when there might well have been.\n\nIn the press conference afterwards, McClenaghan first took a seat and stared down at his medal.\n\n\"It's better than imagined, and it's got a piece of the Eiffel Tower. And I love Paris so much. It feels like it was just meant to be, on this day. I love seeing that Eiffel Tower. It never gets boring. And now I've got a piece of it hanging around my neck attached to an Olympic gold medal. That's absurd to me.\"\n\nSeven years after announcing his arrival at age 18, beating Whitlock to win gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, McClenaghan has added to his eight championship medals (two World Championship gold and one bronze, three European gold, plus Commonwealth Games gold and silver).\n\nHe celebrated on Saturday with family and friends, and his first drink in seven months.\n\n\"All athletes have their own story, but of course I obviously pay close attention to my own, and I'm trying to write that in the happiest fashion I can and that isn't medal-dependant.\n\n\"That's enjoying the journey, enjoying going to competitions around the world, enjoying going training every day. Having gymnastics as my job never gets old, even just saying that, because that in itself is a lifelong dream.\n\n\"It's something I dreamed of when I was in school, literally daydreaming when I was in class about gymnastics routines. The fact that is what I do, that I'm a professional gymnast, is already a win. But then of course the medals are the driving force, that's the pinnacle of our sport, we're always working towards that.\n\n\"I made it very apparent even after Tokyo that I wanted to enjoy that journey to the top of that mountain. Even if I didn't come away with that, I still would've had that goal of trying to inspire as many as possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Delany", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron Delany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Kurbanov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Kurbanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2021", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2021"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhr\u00e1n_na_bhFiann", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2018_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2018 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIVB_Volleyball_Men's_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/PRGCU7LLLZA2BCEWRHU7DLVPBM.jpg?smart=true&auth=56c8fe35301990670241f6ea8490f316ebd8f5d99ce3c7fdd67d553fe26fff4f&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Of course, the events in Tokyo three years ago meant that we would not be taking anything for granted.\n\nMcClenaghan has been the best pommel horse performer in the world over the last few years, winning two world and two European golds since the last Olympics. That made him the favourite in Paris, although we saw in the last games how quickly things can change in this event.\n\nThankfully, there was to be no such drama on this occasion.\n\nThe Irishman would produce a remarkable performance, blowing the competition away with a stunning routine that powered him to the gold medal.\n\nIn the end, he more than deserved the honour of winning Ireland's first ever Olympic gymnastics medal.\n\nREAD HERE: Rhys McClenaghan's Mam In Tears As 'Sacrifices' Pay Off With Olympic Gold\n\nRhys McClenaghan cut an emotional figure after his routine, while he also shed a few tears after finally getting his hands on the gold medal that he has spent his entire life working towards.\n\nHe had returned to his calm and collected self by the time his television interview rolled around, but it was still clear just how much this achievement meant to him.\n\nThree years ago, at just 22-years old, Rhys McClenaghan suffered the ultimate heartbreak on the Olympic stage. It would have been easy to be overcome after that disappointment, but even in the direct aftermath of events, displayed a remarkable amount of insight into what had occurred.\n\nLooking back knowing what we do now, it's amazing to see just how much of what he said actually came to fruition.\n\nI know that I'll feel disappointment with this performance but that's OK.\n\nI feel like that when I do feel disappointment, that's when I'm more motivated than ever, more hungry than ever. I'm definitely the type of person to turn a negative into positive. That's exactly what I'm going to do.\n\nI'm going to leave this arena with this incredible experience: Becoming an Olympian, becoming the first Irish gymnast to be an Olympic finalist. That's something that is very special to me. That's my achievement that I've made here at these Olympic Games.\n\nI will be more hungry. This is a very early chapter in my gymnastics career...\n\nI've enjoyed the journey, and that's a victory for me. It's definitely not the end of the journey by any means.\n\nMy finger got caught under the handle. It throws off your whole momentum - what can you do?\n\nI know that I'll adjust, that I'll fix that, and come back a way better gymnast, a way better man.\n\nWhat a competitor.\n\nWhile everyone supporting him here in Ireland might have been worried about the effect his mishap in Tokyo would have on him, Rhys McClenaghan was never going to let it hold him back.\n\nNow, his Olympic gold medal will have banished those demons once and for all.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irishman_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Irishman (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wOFxcXC8wMzE4NTMyMVxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wOC0wM1QxODUzMDUuMjAzLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI3NTI1Nzk0ZTAyMzNlNzlkMWM2ZGE5YmRkMjNkMDdhZjRlNjc5MDM3In0=/rhysmcclenaghanwordsaftertokyoheartbreakringtruerthaneverafterparistriumphballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Luke was previously a competitior but moved into coaching and is now looking after World and European Champion Rhys.\n\nDoes he have a girlfriend?\n\nRhys is rumoured to be dating fellow gymnast Emily Carr. He has posted about her on Instagram but prefers to keep details of his love life out of the public eye.\n\nBuilding dream home\n\nRhys has another passion project outside of gymnastics. He is building his dream home aged just 25.\n\nThe athlete opened up about the build in RTE documentary Path to Paris, which was filmed in the run-up to the Olympics.\n\n\"This is my first house, which is cool,\" he said on it.\n\n\"Lots of work still to be done. We're just back from Italy after winning our third European medal, which is quite nice to say. That European championships was a huge goal for this year.

My dad's a joiner, so luckily he is steering me in the right direction. It's almost like it's going to be my reward after the Olympics.\n\n\"It's nice you can have something to look forward to, a goal. Obviously my main goal is the Olympic Games in Paris, but I can think past and look forward to moving into this place, once it doesn't look like it's going to fall to the ground. It's like knowing that no matter what happens on that competition day, I can always come back here and work on the house, I look forward to that, no matter what the result is.\"\n\nCommonwealth Games 'ban'\n\nRhys was banned from competing at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham alongside fellow gymansts Eamon Montogomery and Ewan McAteer, who are also from Northern Ireland. They were told they couldn't compete for Northern Ireland because they represented Ireland in International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) events. This led to significant backlash from a number of sporting bodies and politicians before the decision was overturned.\n\nMedals and honours\n\nRhys is a two-time World Pommel Horse champion, winning gold consecutively in 2022 and 2023, making him the first ever Irish artistic gymnast do that. He is also a three-time European champion as well as a Commonwealth Games champion. In 2021, he was awarded the British Empire Medal for his services to gymnastics and in 2023, he was named RTE's Sportsperson of the Year.\n\nJoin RSVP Live's WhatsApp community to get celebrity news

It doesn't feel real, but we are getting used to it.\"\n\nThe proud parent added that the family \"aren't overly surprised\" by Rhys reaching the final.\n\n\"Because he's a double world champion I suppose we aren't surprised he made it through,\" she said.\n\n\"But sport can be unpredictable, that's for sure. But he has proved himself to be one of, or if not the, best pommel worker in the world, so we're excited it's all come together for him. Just one more routine and then we hope to be celebrating with him.\n\n\"He is more than capable of it,\" she added.\n\n\"He has always aimed for gold and this weekend will be no different.\"\n\nTracy counts Rhys' \"hard work\" for the reason behind his confidence.\n\n\"He's not superstitious and doesn't rely on luck or any of that,\" she explained.\n\n\"He works hard and puts in the repetition for routines. He goes there [to Paris] as well prepared as he can be.\n\n\"That's what gives him the confidence to be able to do what he does. There's no lucky pair of socks or anything like that. It's hard work.\"\n\nThe reigning world and European champion first made his name by topping the podium for Northern Ireland at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018.\n\nThe Co Down mum told this newspaper that, in the run-up to any competition, Rhys is \"super focused and dedicated\" on everything from his diet to his exercise routine.\n\n\"Everything is geared towards that competition,\" she said.\n\n\"From what he eats and puts in his body to his exercise routine and meditation, everything is geared towards that goal of the Olympics. But he has been very relaxed and happy going into this, so we couldn't ask for more.\n\n\"When he was doing gymnastics when he was younger, I kept saying to him that enjoyment was so important. And he loved every minute of it. He loved training.\n\n\"He still loves it -- walking into the gym, the travelling, the competitions -- and I'm not sure you could do it if you didn't,\" she added.\n\n\"It's very full on, but we do know he is very excited about getting a pizza after the final, because he hasn't had junk food in such a long time.\"\n\nThe Team Ireland star suffered at the previous Olympics Games in Tokyo -- where he went into the men's pommel horse final as one of the medal favourites -- after catching a finger on the pommel's handle and falling off the horse, resulting in a seventh-place finish.\n\nReflecting on that day in Japan three years ago, McClenaghan said: \"It was an experience that was needed, obviously, and I'm down here in front of you, a two-time world champion, and that just kind of shows I come back from disappointments and I'm just enjoying being here -- a two-time Olympian, a two-time Olympic finalist.\"\n\nThe world and European champion believes that his rigorous training regime under the watchful eye of coach Luke Carson is the secret to his success.\n\nThe pommel horse final takes place at 4.16pm on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

While he was facing a field that some viewed as the most talented in this year's Olympics, his recent track record at World Championship level suggested he may well have the edge.\n\nThe draw for the final was also kind to the Irishman, with it being suggested that his slot as fourth up in the event was ideal timing for a gymnast with that employed his mix of difficulty and execution.\n\nDespite the heartbreak of four years ago, McClenaghan did not seem to have any nerves as he began his routine. He produced a magnificent performance, one that was more than worthy of the occasion\n\nHis mark of 15.533 was a field leading score at the time, although there was still four more competitors to come after that point.\n\nThankfully, nobody was able to match the standard set by the Down man. He claimed the gold, winning Ireland's first ever Olympic gymnastics medal in the process.\n\nREAD HERE: Mona McSharry's Teammates Were Not Having Her Suggestion Of Stepping Away\n\nThis moment was three years in the making for Rhys McClenaghan, who missed out on a medal in heartbreaking circumstances in Tokyo in 2021. While he would slip from the pommel horse that day, he showed incredible mental strength to produce the performance of a lifetime in Paris.\n\nHe was visibly emotional after his routine moved him to the top of the leaderboard, a reaction that was sure to be a mix of relief and elation. Once the medal was placed around his neck, it was clear what this achievement meant to him.\n\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9 soon after, Rhys McClenaghan summed up his emotions after achieving a lifelong dream. He also took the time to send a message to the people of Ireland.\n\nIt feels like a dream, but it's a dream well earned. I just can't believe that it happened on this day.\n\nI always felt like it was going to happen, but I wasn't sure when...\n\nListen, everybody at home, see this as an example to find a dream you love, chase it, and enjoy that journey.\n\nI can tell that if I fell on my bum today, I still would have loved this journey every second of it. But I didn't and today I'm walking away with an Olympic gold medal...\n\nJust from doing my job as well. After the routine I was happy, I wasn't thinking about medals. When the score came up I was proud of that score because it's mine, I wasn't thinking about the podium at all.\n\nI was just thinking 'I've done my job'. That's where the main emotions came from today...\n\nI knew it can contest (for gold). Every time I do a clean routine it's contesting for that top spot, but I knew that this would also be the toughest pommel horse final of all-time and it was.\n\nTo come out on top is incredible...\n\nIf this even just inspires people to walk through the doors of a gymnastics club then I'll be happy. The amount of life experience that this sport has given me is next to none.\n\nA national treasure.\n\nThe entire country will certainly be thrilled for Rhys McClenaghan, with his journey in recent years one that has captured the imagination of the public.\n\nHe can now finally call himself an Olympic champion.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIVB_Volleyball_Men's_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wOFxcXC8wMzE3NTA1MlxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wOC0wM1QxNzUwMjguMTExLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJlNzBlMDg1MDU5OGE3MTJlNTY5NGNmZWQxY2ExY2E3MTA5OTU2NmU5In0=/rhysmcclenaghansendsremarkablemessagetopeopleofirelandafterhistoricolympicgoldballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

My coach met with my mum and said 'this kid could be the best in the world on the pommel horse',\" explained McClenaghan.\n\nAs a junior he finished third behind Max Whitlock and Louis Smith at the British Championships.\n\nSmith, who was in Paris to see his friend win the gold, was an inspirational role model for McClenaghan.\n\n\"One of my favourite Olympic moments was watching Louis perform his routine in London. I was at the opening ceremony and I saw all the posters of him all over the city and it felt like the weight of the world was on his shoulders.\n\n\"This felt like my Louis Smith London 2012 moment. I was the reigning world champion and could win Ireland's first ever gymnastics medal.\n\n\"That's why the emotions came out, because I'd done my job under all that pressure.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Games title and first European win came in 2018 and when the delayed Tokyo Olympics arrived three years later he was among the favourites.\n\nThat day, it didn't happen for McClenaghan.\n\nHowever, since then he has dominated the world with a pair of global and continental titles.\n\n\"It's a crazy journey. All athletes have their own story. Of course, I am paying close attention to my own story but I'm going to write it in the happiest fashion that I can possibly make it.\n\n\"That journey isn't medal-dependant. It is enjoying the journey, enjoying going to competitions around the world, enjoying going to training every day, having gymnastics as my job - it never gets old even just saying that.\n\n\"That in itself is a lifelong dream and something I dreamt of when I was in school.\n\n\"Literally daydreaming in classes about gymnastics routines.\n\n\"So the fact is, that is what I do, that is me, I am a professional gymnast and that is already a win.\n\n\"Yes, the medals are the driving force. That is the pinnacle of our sport and I'm always working towards that, but I made it very apparent after Tokyo that I wanted to enjoy that journey to the top of that mountain.\n\n\"Even if I didn't walk away with a medal today I would have a lifetime of experience, a lifetime of wins and losses, but today was a win.\"\n\nFor the first time, there were three current world champions from Northern Ireland competing at an Olympic Games.\n\nAll three - McClenaghan, Hannah Scott and Daniel Wiffen - have become Olympic champions in the space of just five days for what has arguably been the greatest week of sport in Northern Ireland's history.\n\n\"It is remarkable,\" McClenaghan added. \"It makes me incredibly proud to come from Northern Ireland and bring home this medal.\n\n\"It's the first gold medal for Newtownards in the Olympics, so I hope I've made everyone back home proud.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Smith_(gymnast)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louis Smith (gymnast)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AaTW4nG9a91o7DKzQ0BR.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/101c26bfecce0368cffe11f76c79c4a7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

He's well on his way to becoming one of the best pommel workers of all time.\"\n\nMr McGovern said they had had a rush of interest in joining the club this week.\n\n\"The amount of people even looking in the windows as they walk past, kids coming in, even interactions I have had walking to the cafe, people wishing Rhys good luck.

Full list for day 9 in Paris\n\nREAD MORE: 'It shows I've got balls' -- Rhys McClenaghan on the risk he took to win Olympic gold\n\nBut Ireland's first-ever Olympic medallist in gymnastics is setting his sights even higher for LA in four years' time as he contemplates expanding his repertoire to doing the floor and doing the all-around events as well.\n\n\"Yeah doing floor, doing all-around - all six of the events in gymnastics - I want to do that almost for fun, I enjoy it,\" he said.. \"And I feel like I'm glad I've accomplished this in pommel horse now and I can switch my focus a little bit to the other events - and possibly help out a gymnastics team in Ireland and contribute in as many ways as possible.\n\n\"Floor would be my second strongest event, for sure. If I'm going to compete in apparatus I want it to be medal-worthy. So, floor definitely has that possibility. But there's a lot of work to be done on it. Hopefully I can start that soon.\"\n\nHe has that elite level focus required to pull it off, just as he did in completing a plan that was formed by his coach Luke Carson a decade ago that McClenaghan would become an Olympic champion. Out of this world talent and bravery were components for his success in Paris.\n\nBut, more than anything, it was focus and consistency that got him over the line in a thrilling final - when McClenaghan delivered the high-calibre, high-tariff routine that he knew he would need to beat one of the most talented fields in his sport ever assembled.\n\n\"It's been a long 10 years,\" said his coach, Luke Carson. \"There's an art in being able to stay focused but not let it overwhelm you. There's a real art to that. And that's something that seemingly, from my point of view, Rhys has mastered because I've never seen someone as focused in their life.\n\n\"What he did is what he's done every day in training for the last year, and I promise you I'm not joking. He has treated every session like it was an Olympic Games final. And the point of that is that when it comes to the Olympic Games final, that it's just another training session.\n\n\"Don't get overwhelmed by the 12 and a half thousand people and the reality that it's the highest standard pommel final of all time and that there's probably going to be a few world records set and you're going to have to top that.\n\n\"Obviously those are realities but you can't control a lot of those things, so what I tried to do is say to him just to focus on what we can control. He knew that and that's something that he's really mastered, and that's why he is now an Olympic champion.\"\n\nBut where does that laser focus come from? McClenaghan puts it down to striving to be consistent every day. \"Just knowing that it's needed, knowing that the most difficult thing you can do is focus every day in training, stay consistent in training,\" he said.\n\n\"I never have any really good days or really bad days in training, I stay consistent - and that's the most difficult thing to do in sport. I think it's what sets me apart from many other athletes.\n\n\"You just hear of some people having bad days and saying they'll have a better day tomorrow. I have every day at my best possible and that consistency just shows on my competition days because that routine there, I've done similar routines over the last month or so.

I can't believe it's happened. I always felt like it was going to happen, I just wasn't sure when.'\n\nMcClenaghan arrived at the eight-man final as favourite after heading qualifying and with his two world titles.\n\nBut he also had to contend with heaps of pressure after falling off the apparatus at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games three years ago to trail in seventh.\n\nHe wasn't about to let this second shot at writing his name in Irish sporting folklore go awry though.\n\nWith a score of 15.533 he wept tears of joy on the top of the podium as he listened to 'Amhran na bhFiann' - the Irish national anthem - with green, white and orange tricolours being waved proudly from the stands by his legion of supporters at the Bercy Arena.\n\nKurbanov had been the first to perform and he set a high bar with a score of 15.433.\n\nNext up was Whitlock, seeking an unprecedented fourth medal on the same apparatus after golds at the last two Games in Tokyo and Rio, and bronze at London 2012.\n\nAnd the 31-year-old's slick Olympic swansong was enough to leave him sitting third behind McClenaghan and Kurbanov until Nedoroscik took his place on the podium by 0.100pts.\n\nNedoroscik is the US gymnastics team's one-trick pony - the pommel horse his sole speciality.\n\nHis father bought him an old one from the 1980s at auction when he was a youngster and from that moment he was hooked.\n\n'When you only do one event you don't get to test the others. You just go out there and swing. But I've been doing this for eight years now as a specialist, so really tested the waters. I feel amazing,' said the man from Massachusetts.\n\nHe had posted the same score as McClenaghan in qualifying, meaning Ireland's third gold medallist of the 2024 Games had a tense wait to see if his American title rival would gatecrash his party.\n\nHe said he purposely hadn't watched those performing after him, but that didn't stop the nerves.\n\n'I was nervous.

Olympic gold his crowning glory.\n\nWatching the pommel horse final was a gripping 40 minutes or so.\n\nA week ago, Stephen Nedoroscik's potential as a gold medallist was flagged up by RT\u00c9 commentator Colm Murray; in qualifying both he and McClenaghan posted the same score. Max Whitlock, in this his swansong event, could not be discounted. And then there was Nariman Kurbanov from Kazakhstan.\n\nAnd it was the latter who set the target in the final, though to me and my untutored eye, Max Whitlock's routine looked impressive, that was until he lacked a variety in his movements towards the end. \"You only use so many elements (types of movement), you then have to change. If not, the general person in the crowd would get bored,\" that was Colm Murray's summation of the scoring in gymnastics. I did take notes on what he had to say, you know!\n\nAnd then Rhys took to the horse, exactly three years on from when his maiden Olympic Games ended as a result of a minor slip in the final. European and World titles would follow, catapulting him as the man to beat.\n\nThe sizeable Irish crowd in the Bercy Arena gave Rhys a huge welcome, cheered his every turn and twist as went through his routine. The cheering grew louder, yet one feared that his hand might slip off the edge, but that's part of the thrill. The pommel horse, like all the other artistic gymnastic disciplines, is so much more impressive in the flesh. Simone Biles, a half an hour earlier, pounding on to that vault and adding to her medal haul, is better watched live.\n\nMcCleneghan then landed on the floor with a kind of thump. The packed arena were appreciative of his efforts. Kurbanov's score was 15.434, an impressive mark. And then we all looked up at that screen in the middle; target score on the left and then a graphic, after what felt like an eternity, would reveal 15.533 as McClenaghan's score. Our man was in front.\n\nA short break in the action. Over to you Stephen Nedoroscik. The United States following in the crowd was substantial and Nedoroscik was performing to a stirring soundtrack. His score of 15.300 was met by huge cheers from the Irish contingent; Nedoroscik and McCleneghan would hug each other. They're good friends, but the man from Newtownards, even with three participants still to perform, had gold in the bag.\n\nThe 25-year-old's climb to the top of the mountain was complete. Of course he will want to stay there. He turned to Nedoroscik in the press conference afterwards and said: \"LA baby!\" McClenaghan will be 29 as the gymnastics is concluding in Los Angeles.\n\nGolden moment for Rhys\n\nWe need your consent to load this comcast-player contentWe use comcast-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nAnd while he did not know that his performance would deliver gold as soon as he finished his routine, Ireland's latest Olymppic gold medallist knew he had executed something special\n\n\"I knew that I had done my job, that I went through the most difficult routine I could do on this, for doing it under that amount of pressure,\" was McClenaghan's reaction when he spoke to the waiting press.\n\n\"That's where the tears and emotions came from really. What an amazing final to be a part of. I said to Stephren that this is the best pommel horse final that has ever happened in the history of men's gymnastics. To be a part of that is absolutely incredible.\"\n\nMcClenaghan lamented the fact that he didn't get into the 9s in the execution. All gymnasts want that 'perfect 10' but that chase of perfection, a chase that isn't always attainable, is what drives those at the top forward.\n\nFor McClenaghan, a weight has now been lifted off him. His trajectory, after World and European success, had to show an Olympic gold on some point of the graph. He knew that Nedoroscik could do a huge difficulty and pull it off when it mattered, but even the American knew that the Newtownards man had set a mark that was beyond his reach.\n\nAnd so a third gold medal for Ireland at these Games, in a sport we never we thought we could or should be medalling in.\n\nFor McClenaghan, he has completed the grand slam. Three years since that slip in Tokyo. \"It's been a crazy journey and I'm trying to write in the happiest fashion I can possibly make it,\" he added when summing up the time since.\n\n\"I want to enjoy the journey, going to competitions around the world, going training. Gymnastics is my job and it's something I dreamed of when I was in school. I was daydreaming in class about gymnastic routines. Being a professional gymnast is already a win.\"\n\nAnd now he scaled the heights, with golden medals to cement his status in the sport.\n\nThe journey continues. More twists and turns, like those he perfects on the horse, are sure to enthral us for a few more years set.\n\nWatch the 2024 Olympic Games with 14 hours of televised action on RT\u00c92 and RT\u00c9 Player each day.

This triumph was particularly sweet as it laid to rest the disappointment of the Tokyo Games, where a mishap getting his finger getting caught in the apparatus dashed his hopes for a medal.\n\nNow, as Ireland's first Olympic medallist in gymnastics, he's aiming even higher for the LA Games, considering adding floor exercises and all-around events to his already impressive skill set, reports the Irish Mirror.\n\nRead next: Rhys McClenaghan achieves Olympic gold medal dream as long-term plan pays off\n\nRead next: 'Emotional' Daniel Wiffen wins bronze to claim second medal at Paris Olympic Games\n\n\"Yeah doing floor, doing all-around all six of the events in gymnastics - I want to do that almost for fun, I enjoy it,\" he expressed. \"And I feel like I'm glad I've accomplished this in pommel horse now and I can switch my focus a little bit to the other events - and possibly help out a gymnastics team in Ireland and contribute in as many ways as possible.\n\n\"Floor would be my second strongest event, for sure. If I'm going to compete in apparatus I want it to be medal-worthy. So, floor definitely has that possibility. But there's a lot of work to be done on it. Hopefully I can start that soon.\"\n\nLuke Carson, coach of the new Olympic pommel horse champion, has shed some light on the impressive dedication and fierce concentration that propelled his protege to success. Carson explained how a strategy devised ten years ago came to fruition in Paris with McClenaghan having the elite level focus required to pull it off.\n\n\"It's been a long 10 years,\" said Carson. \"There's an art in being able to stay focused but not let it overwhelm you. There's a real art to that. And that's something that seemingly, from my point of view, Rhys has mastered because I've never seen someone as focused in their life.\n\n\"What he did is what he's done every day in training for the last year, and I promise you I'm not joking. He has treated every session like it was an Olympic Games final. And the point of that is that when it comes to the Olympic Games final, that it's just another training session.\n\n\"Don't get overwhelmed by the 12 and a half thousand people and the reality that it's the highest standard pommel final of all time and that there's probably going to be a few world records set and you're going to have to top that.\n\n\"Obviously those are realities but you can't control a lot of those things, so what I tried to do is say to him just to focus on what we can control. He knew that and that's something that he's really mastered, and that's why he is now an Olympic champion.\"\n\nBut where does that unwavering concentration stem from? McClenaghan credits his success to a dedication to daily consistency, noting: \"Just knowing that it's needed, knowing that the most difficult thing you can do is focus every day in training, stay consistent in training,\" as the key to his achievement.\n\n\"I never have any really good days or really bad days in training, I stay consistent - and that's the most difficult thing to do in sport. I think it's what sets me apart from many other athletes.\"\n\nIt's this ethos which he believes puts him ahead of the curve: \"You just hear of some people having bad days and saying they'll have a better day tomorrow. I have every day at my best possible and that consistency just shows on my competition days because that routine there, I've done similar routines over the last month or so.

One finger placement is all it took to knock me off the horse.\"\n\nSimilar to the successes of swimmer Daniel Wiffen and boxer Kellie Harrington, a nation expected in Paris.\n\nAnd that expectation is something that has never weighed heavily on the Down man's shoulders.\n\nConfidence is certainly a virtue when you are spinning your body around the horse knowing one tiny mistake can end your chances.\n\nHe's been honing his craft since the age of six with Rathgael GC in Bangor.\n\n\"He was a nightmare, if I'm honest, climbing trees, doing double somersaults on his trampoline,\" his mother Tracy told RT\u00c9 Sport of his early promise.\n\n\"He was doing gymnastics before he went to gymnastics, that's why we took him to gymnastics.

I'm so proud to be able to do that,\" said McClenaghan, who revealed during the pandemic restrictions he became interested in astrophysics and astronomy.\n\nWhile, it's one thing looking up at the stars, now the affable Irishman can say he has reached them.\n\nIt's always been about the Olympic Games and excelling at the showpiece event;

I got to see all the buzz, my friends and family, and to celebrate for a little while and then headed off to bed at 12.30.\"\n\n\"It was so great just to see everybody. I haven't seen them in three weeks so it was good just to hug my parents, hug my girlfriend and celebrate together.\"\n\n\"Jamie Dornan messaged me.

It's incredible to see that Irish support coming out, to welcome another Olympic medal into the Irish team.\"\n\n\"I guess it just shows how proud people are to see another Irish person doing well. That is always reciprocated by me as well for any success that happens on this island. It makes me proud.\"\n\n\"To contribute to that is always an honour, the more the merrier in my eyes. I wish the rest of the athletes success in the week to come, leading into the finish of the Olympic Games. I am incredibly proud to be a part of this team.

He has loved the difference between the Covid-hit Games of three years ago with how things have gone in Paris - especially with Ireland enjoying an unprecedented week of success at these Olympics.\n\n\"It's been great,\" he smiled. \"It's been great to see that contrast between Tokyo and Paris. \"I'm now able to shake hands with the other Team Ireland athletes, congratulate people, have conversations with other people and get to know them very well and to see who is making up this team that is the most successful Irish Olympic team ever.\n\n\"That's special and I'm glad I get to experience it this time.\"\n\nMcClenaghan is planning to get to a number of Olympic events now that he has finished his own competition.

All he asked of them all was they believed as much as he did.\n\n\"If couldn't get them on board, it just wasn't possible,\" said Carson, \"because otherwise it's just a crazy guy saying things.\"\n\nThree years on from Tokyo, when McClenaghan's Olympic dreams went up in smoke after a slip of the fingers inside 10 seconds, it appears destined that their decade-long plan would be realised in Paris.\n\nThis time, there would be no mistakes, and no regrets. Whether he won gold, medalled or came home with nothing at all, so be it. If he gave his best possible performance and was beaten by the better man, he could live with that.\n\nBut, from the moment McClenaghan walked into a packed Bercy Arena, he was tuned into another world, determined not to absorb any of the emotion still flying around moments after US superstar Simone Biles had claimed a third gold of the Games.\n\nFourth on the pommel, he either looked the other way or turned his back on opponents' routines; not looking at them, not looking at their score. This was about him and no-one else.\n\nNariman Kurbanov from Kazakhstan was first up, hitting an impressive 15.434. It was a standard defending champion Max Whitlock was unable to reach as his dreams of hanging on to gold disappeared in that instant.\n\nWhen McClenaghan's turn came, a hush fell upon the arena. Even with all he has achieved in the time between, the two World golds in particular, you wondered was there anything left of Tokyo that might creep in when the pressure reached its peak.\n\nThere wasn't. He promised to raise his game again from last week's heat, and he did so in some style to he score 15.533 (difficulty 6.600, execution 8.933), up from 15.200 in qualifying.\n\nThe second his feet touched the matt upon dismount, it all came out; a huge roar lost in the applause of the crowd as he grabbed the lead at the halfway mark, tears already flowing by the time he reached his chair.\n\n\"No matter what happened after that, I had done my job...\"\n\nThe rest was pure tension and drama it what is now considered the highest quality pommel horse final of all time. American Stephen Nedoroscik produced a magical routine and, Irish stomachs churning as the familiar sound of a pulse filled the arena during the interminable wait for a score to materialise.\n\nAnd then it came - 15.300. One of the men expected to give McClenaghan the biggest run for his money has just fallen short. The dream was now in sight as, one by one, each challenger failed to hit his incredible height.\n\n\"I literally dreamed it,\" he beamed, \"I literally dreamed that I scored a 15.5, but I never dreamed that I won, which is weird.\n\n\"I'm not one to look into dreams like that, I just think it has been part of this plan, part of what we've been aiming for for so many years since I started training with Luke. That's 10 years ago, and when I started with him, there was a 10-year plan to win an Olympic gold medal, and here it is today.\"\n\nTokyo had taken a toll, there's no question. McClenaghan tried to play it down after his heat, having a nip at journalists for referring back to that fateful day three summers ago.\n\n\"I've done a lot of competitions that you guys didn't even watch in between that...\"\n\nBut Carson described that Olympic experience as \"traumatic\" for gymnast and coach. To come back to the same stage, with the huge weight of expectation that winning world titles brings, requires incredible self-belief, and maybe a little bit more.\n\n\"It shows I've got balls anyway.\n\n\"There was certainly added pressure today, but I put pressure on myself every single day in training and there was one session - Tuesday this week - I split my legs on the upgraded skill that I put in the routine and I was raging with myself. I was angry.\n\n\"It felt like it was a competition but at the same time when I do clean routines, I get as pumped as I feel during competitions. And that comes from that pressure I put on myself - I get nervous in training sessions and I feel like because of that respect that I give each training session, that's why I can perform in competition environments like today.\" Last week, McClenaghan said he was sitting on the top of the mountain, enjoying the view. If that was the case, then his head must now surely be in the clouds, though pizza and a few beers were the only things on his agenda as Saturday evening turned into night.\n\nYet, even in the most manic of moments, he speaks with the composure and clarity of a little Buddha.\n\nBecause this gold medal, for as much as it represented the high point of a breathtaking personal journey, is also a platform to promote the sport he loves, and to show the next generation that anything is possible.\n\nEven if, at some points, there is no choice but to get back on the horse.\n\n\"The view is really, really nice right now.

We don't want him to go too clean, but if he goes clean, he is a tall gymnast and he'll look good,\" she said of the Kazakh.\n\n\"He's the first gymnast the judges will have seen and beforehand the judges will have been told in the meeting they have to separate the gymnasts and the only way they can separate them is on the execution.\n\n\"Clean routines score high, and take deductions for routines that aren't as clean. So you'll expect him to get a good execution score.\n\nSecond Max will go and Max is a totally different gymnast, really difficult routine but he is not as clean, so they'll have to pull him apart to separate those two gymnasts.\n\n\"Up next we have Loran (de Munck) from Netherlands, also clean, so another clean score. They'll be ranking the execution as they go, so they'll have to post another clean score for Loran if he's clean.\n\n\"And then Rhys is fourth, so you have the cleanest pommel horse worker up fourth after the judges have had a good run of clean versus not so clean and if he does what he did in training, they'll have to go the highest score they can award so far,\" said Kavanagh.\n\n\"The draw he has got is fantastic.\n\n\"Stephen (Nedoroscik) from USA is fifth, he is also clean but not as clean as Rhys.\n\n\"So for me, my heart and head would say, Rhys will be first, Max second and Kurbanov or Stephen third.\"\n\nListen to the RT\u00c9 Olympics Podcast on the RT\u00c9 Radio Player, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

That's absurd to me.\"\n\nThree years ago, McClenaghan's finger got caught in one of the bars on the pommel horse, ending his medal hopes as he finished seventh.\n\nStraight away, the then 22-year-old articulated his ambition to bounce back by taking gold in Paris. He realised that in style.\n\nHe said: \"All athletes have their own story but of course I obviously pay close attention to my own story.\n\n\"But I'm trying to write that in the happiest fashion I can possibly make it and that isn't medal-dependant.\n\n\"That is enjoying the journey, enjoying going to competitions around the world, enjoying going training every day, having gymnastics as my job never gets old, even just saying that, because that in itself is a life-long dream.\n\n\"That's something I dreamed of when I was in school, literally day-dreaming when I was in class about gymnastics routines.\n\n\"The fact that is what I do, that I'm a professional gymnast, is already a win.\n\n\"But then of course the medals are the driving force, that's the pinnacle of our sport, we're always working towards that.\n\n\"I made it very apparent even after Tokyo that I wanted to enjoy that journey to the top of that mountain.\"\n\nFourth up in the eight-man final, he posted a score of 15.333. He insisted that he did not know straight away that he had done enough to win gold but he had.\n\nHe knocked Kazakhstan's Nariman Kurbanov off top spot with Stephen Nedoroscik of the USA the only one of the subsequent competitors to get a score above 15 with his 15.200 enough for bronze.\n\nMcClenaghan said: \"I didn't know that I'd won as soon as I landed. But I knew that I had done my job.\n\n\"I'd done the most difficult routine I could do on this day and that's where the tears and the emotions came from really.\n\n\"Either of these guys can beat that score but what an amazing final to be a part of. This was the best pommel horse final that has ever happened in my eyes, ever, in the history of men's gymnastics.\n\n\"To be a part of that is incredible and any one of those eight finalists could have taken gold today.\"\n\nMcClenaghan did so by attempting and executing his most difficult routine yet.\n\nHe said: \"It shows I've got balls anyway. There's a tiniest little hesitation during that routine where you can either go for the difficult skill towards the end of the routine or you don't.\n\n\"That routine I did in qualifications that would've been a 15.2 I would've scored.\n\n\"So, I had to suck it up, get it done, put that new skill in and it worked out because I came away with a personal best score. I can't ask for more than that.\n\n\"But there's a couple of height circles that I would have liked to stretch out a bit more. I'm glad I glued those legs together towards the end of the routine.\n\n\"That was always a goal and that's something that I've been susceptible to in the past - it's like a nervous thing, if you ever see a pommel horse worker split their legs, it's like they're nervous as if they felt something's off a little bit.\n\n\"But I want to feel even if something is off that I can glue those legs together and I feel like I done that today.\n\n\"And then of course just to have the balls to do that added skill, not backing out of it. I could have just played it safe, done the qualification routine like normal.\n\n\"But instead we went out there and did the highest difficulty I had ever put out in an international competition. I risked it all and came away with the biscuit.\"\n\nIt represent the realisation of a 10-year plan with Luke Carson who, he said, turned him from a mediocre gymnast.\n\nHe said: \"Luke clearly saw a path. It's not often I've heard him say 'I think this kid can be a world champion', but he said it for me.\n\n\"So he clearly saw a path that I could take, we took that path, I followed Luke on every programme he done, questioned him very little, although of course it's healthy to question your coach every now and then.\n\n\"I owe Luke a lot, this is our medal and I'm proud it's that way.\"\n\nBut he might hang onto this medal himself having given one of his World Championships golds to Carson for his Origin Gymnastics gym to inspire the next generation.\n\nAnd he knows from personal experience how a Games can do that for a youngster.\n\nMcClenaghan said: \"I just saw Louis Smith there in the media zone and one of my favourite Olympic moments, maybe my favourite, was when he performed his routine at the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n\"I went to and watched the Opening Ceremony and saw posters of Lewis Smith everywhere.\n\n\"It seemed like the weight of the world was on his shoulders and it felt like this was my Louis Smith London 2012 moment coming in here.\n\n\"I'm the double world champion coming into this, Ireland knew this could be our first ever Olympic gymnastics medal and I delivered under that pressure.\n\n\"That was the emotion that you were seeing there that I had done my job regardless of that pressure I was under.\n\n\"I talked to him in the media zone. It's mad seeing him standing right there in my Olympic moment, when his Olympic moment was my inspiration for my entire career.\n\n\"That right there is a working example of that inspiration working and that trickledown effect.\n\n\"There might be a kid in the crowd there that is saying, 'Jesus that was amazing.' That was so good, I want to do that.'\n\n\"That might stick in their brain -- into whatever sport they do, whatever job they do, career path they do. And that might inspire them to be the best they can possibly be.\n\n\"That shows the power of these Olympic Games.\n\n\"I could lock my door and stay away, not talk to anybody for the next year or two, but I'm not going to do that.\n\n\"I'm going to be out, I'm going to be inspiring hopefully, and I want as many kids as possible to touch this medal and see that it's a reality as much as possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_o_riordan@thesun.ie", "name": "Neil O'Riordan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nariman_Kurbanov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nariman Kurbanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Smith_(gymnast)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Smith (gymnast)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GETTY_Paris-2024-Olympic-Games-Opening-Ceremony_SPO_GYI2163858254jpg-JS919905230.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't long before I was doing handstands and blackflips in the back garden.\"\n\nBorn to swimming coach Tracy and keen sportsman Danny, young Rhys was a bundle of energy from day one.\n\nLike most hyperactive children he tried his hand at all sports. He played rugby at school, football for his local amateur club Ards Rangers and he swam competitively for Ards Swimming Club - a club with a proud history of producing Olympians and Paralympians.\n\nBut Rhys' pathway to the Games came via another route.\n\n\"I think my parents took me to gymnastics lessons just so I could burn off some energy without breaking the furniture.\n\n\"A gymnastics centre is a magical place for a kid. There's a big foam put, there's bars to swing on, there's a trampoline to bounce on and a spring-loaded floor. What more do you want?\"\n\nRhys wanted glory. Olympic glory. Right from his mid-teens he told anyone that would listen that his aim was to become 'the best in the world.' To be 'undeniable.'\n\nHis breakthrough came as a fifth former at Regent House in 2016 when - aged just 16 - he finished third on the pommel horse at the British Championships, just behind Max Whitlock and Louis Smith, two established Olympians preparing for the Rio Games.\n\nHe defeated Whitlock for the first time on the Gold Coast just two years later, when a sublime routine secured a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. At 18, he was already a household name in Northern Ireland.\n\nAnd when he returned home from Australia, he was paraded through Newtownards on an open to bus before greeted hundreds of fans from a specially erected stage in Conway Square.\n\nAs if he wasn't popular enough in his home town, when journalists referred to him as 'Bangor's Rhys McClenaghan', he took to Twitter to put them right.\n\nThere is an unfair assumption in some parts that Rhys might be disliked in his hometown because he represents Ireland. And while you'll always find the odd idiot in the comments section, Rhys has always been held in great affection by the people of Newtownards.\n\n\"I've seen comments on social media,\" McClenaghan told the Irish Independent. \"But they're not real people saying it to your face. Not one person has said one negative thing to my face around what country I should represent.\"\n\nThat connection with his hometown remains as strong as ever. Earlier this year, he and his coach Luke Carson opened their gym - Origin Gymnastics - in the town's Blair Mayne Complex.\n\n\"I want to see the younger generation come through and follow in my footsteps, surpassing my achievements. I just want to see people enjoying the sport of gymnastics.\"\n\nHe is also club ambassador for Ards FC - a role he doesn't take lightly. McClenaghan has supported the homeless club's campaign for a new ground, and delivered an inspirational speech to the first team during the heat of a relegation battle.\n\nInspired by athletes like Michael Jordan, artists like Kendrick Lamar and authors like Jessie Barr, McClenaghan is a deep-thinker. Don't be surprised if works in sports psychology once he dismounts from the pommel horse for the last time.\n\nAfter all, he's had to deal with his fair share of setbacks. In 2018, Rathgael Gymnastic Club - the Bangor club where he had trained for a decade - cut their coaching programme in an acrimonious dispute that made front page headlines.\n\nAfter a stint practicing on his own pommel horse in his back garden, McClenaghan was forced to relocate to Dublin and train at the National Training Centre, with coach Luke Carson making the long commute from Lisburn.\n\nHe also had to fight tooth and nail for his right to defend his Commonwealth title at Birmingham 2022, after a bizarre decision - eventually reversed after huge backlash - barred the Northern Ireland team from competing at the Games.\n\nAnd then there was Tokyo. That agonising finger slip in the Olympic final that cost him a real tilt at Max Whitlock in the medals.\n\nBut with his incredible mental strength and outrageous ability, McClenaghan has overcome all those setbacks to climb to the top of the Olympic mountain. Where the view is almost as good as it is from the top of Scrabo.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

McClenaghan has released his latest YouTube video. He filmed the final clip in his room on Friday night. It was a full outline of his emotional wellbeing. One bed, a bare chest, his intense stare made up the frame. Pared back and raw.\n\nConsider that for a moment. Several Irish athletes step away from social media entirely before the Olympics, entrusting it to a handler for the duration of the games. Others do whatever they can to take their mind off the competition. American bronze medallist Stephen Nedoroscik told the press conference he has taken to solving rubik's cube to keep him occupied.\n\nMcClenaghan is different. We know this because he exposes it, weekly on his own channel. Given that his qualifier took place seven days ago with no media duties in between, it means the only insight into his mental state is through that lens. What an insight it is, too.\n\n\"I am just sitting on my bed editing this video,\" explained. \"I am only realising I haven't really gathered too much footage. I guess my mind has been on other things. It is currently the night before my Olympic Games final. I guess this section can just be an honest piece to camera for you guys.\n\n\"I feel like I have already accomplished what I set out to do. I enjoyed every second of this Olympic Games experience, I will hopefully enjoy every second of this final tomorrow. It really was the contrast I needed to see in comparison to the Tokyo Games.\"\n\nThree years ago in Tokyo, McClenaghan fell off the pommel and finished seventh. The road from there to here has been documented thoroughly. In one sense, it should be expected that the 25-year-old is at the forefront of a new digital wave. He is one of several Irish athletes charting their story online. The social media age has expanded and overrun all kinds of traditional borders in the process.\n\nSome of that self-generated content is good, plenty isn't. This week McClenaghan brought the camera around the Olympic village and through the security checks. He spoke openly about the absence of the anxious energy that haunted him in Tokyo. Last time he didn't take advantage of the merchandise shop to stock up on gifts for friends and family. He didn't savour the glow around the star.\n\nCome along to the podium on training day. His first visit to the arena, his use of competition equipment, his ability to transform his mindset to the point of mental pressure that stimulates qualification.\n\nThis sport is defined by such mental fortitude. As Kazakhstani Nariman Kurbanov took to the floor, McClenaghan sat with his head bowed. His feet scarcely touched the ground, dangling gently beneath him. His position for rival Max Whitlock's subsequent performance was similar. He rose to stretch and turned his back to Loran de Munck. Then the Dutch man fell.\n\nHow would that affect him? There is another moment for his YouTube for this moment. During his practice round in Paris, McClenaghan zoomed his camera in on the pommel horse. Right up close. Blood stains spattered its veneer. He didn't do it out of disgust. This was a testament to his code, a representation of the hard work required to make it to the top. Falling is a battle scar. Show them with pride.\n\nRegardless of how Saturday went, the Newtownards man was heading home content. This isn't hindsight stuff spewed to absolve the pain of a defeat. He told us this the night before.\n\n\"It was just a completely different experience. There are a lot of things going through my mind right now, but the one at the forefront of it is I am incredibly proud of myself and all of the work and dedication and sacrifice I have done to get here.\n\n\"That is why it is a celebration just to be in this Olympic Games final. I know I am ready, so let's show up with a smile on my face and have the best time.\"\n\nThe goal. That is how he wanted to go out. How did it go? He stood on top of the podium and cradled the gold medal in both hands. As the final notes of Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann sang, McClenaghan looked straight across from him at a green mass celebrating and his lips began to twitch. Stadium staff appeared and passed a phone to Nedoroscik for the sponsored Victory Selfie. He held his hand aloft, turned the phone towards the trio and Rhys McClenaghan smiled.

all six of the events in gymnastics - I want to do that almost for fun.\n\n\"I enjoy it and I feel like, I'm glad I've accomplished this in pommel horse now and I can switch my focus a little bit to the other events and possibly help out a gymnastics team in Ireland and contribute in as many ways as possible.\n\n\"Floor would be my second strongest event for sure.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_ryan@thesun.ie", "name": "Andrew Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_\u00d3_Briain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dara \u00d3 Briain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray,_County_Wicklow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bray, County Wicklow"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Down", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Down"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dornan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dornan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/crop-13551909.jpg?1722855783&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It was real. It was gold. He liked what saw.\n\n\"It's got a piece of the Eiffel Tower in it,\" he said. \"And I love Paris so much. It feels like it just was meant to be, this day.\"\n\nThe Newtownards man had just become the first Irish gymnast to win a medal at the Olympic Games and it was gold to boot.\n\nIt took a personal best score to beat Norman Kurbanov of Kazakhstan and Stephen Nedoroscik into silver and bronze while his old rival Max Whitlock finished out of the medals in fourth.\n\n\"I saw Max after I celebrated a little bit. He had tears in his eyes, and I just wanted to say to him that he's an inspiration of mine. He always has been,\" said McClenaghan.\n\nAfter the disappointment of Tokyo, McClenaghan was not going leave Paris wondering what if.\n\nHe came for gold and attempted a difficult routine he thought would deliver it. When he moment came, his execution was near flawless.\n\n\"It shows I've got balls anyway,\" said the 25-year-old. \"There's a tiniest little hesitation during that routine where you can either go for the difficult skill towards the end of the routine or you don't.\n\n\"That routine I done in qualifications, that would've been a 15.2 I would've scored. So, I had to suck it up, get it done, put that new skill in and it worked out today because I came away with a personal best score. I can't ask for more than that.\"\n\nIt's the culmination of years of hard work, sacrifice and dedication. He hasn't had a slice of pizza or a beer since New Year's Eve.\n\nThis afternoon in the Bercy Arena, less than an hour after La Magicienne Simone Biles won gold again, it all came together for the County Down man.\n\n\"I'm glad I glued those legs together at the end of the routine. That was always a goal and something that I have been susceptible to in the past,\" he said. \"And then of course just to have the balls to do that added skill, not backing out of it.\n\n\"I could have just played it safe, done the qualification routine like normal, but instead we went out there and done the highest difficulty I had ever put out in an international competition.\n\n\"Risked it all and came away with the biscuit.\"\n\nAnd what a biscuit. When he made his dismount from the horse he punched the air and started to cry. He didn't know he'd done enough to win gold, but knew he couldn't have done any more.\n\n\"No, I didn't know that I'd won as soon as I landed.

Certainly the other two guys on the podium, they both said they'd continue to LA so I look forward to other competitions where we'll be battling it out.\"", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sinead_o_carroll@the42.ie", "name": "Sinead O'Carroll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newtownards"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6454969/listing?version=6454984&width=590", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

There were no slips or stutters on Saturday afternoon. He nailed it with a score of 15.533 that none of the other seven could match.\n\nHis is the sixth medal claimed by Ireland at these Games. That's a number that matches the country's best ever haul, at London 2012, and there is every likelihood that it will be beaten before the weekend is out with Daniel Wiffen and Rory McIlroy both in the hunt.\n\nMcClenaghan was fourth of the eight competitors in action. Nariman Kurbanov set a high standard from the off, the Kazakh scoring a very exacting 15.433 with his routine and that was too much for reigning champion Max Whitlock of Team GB.\n\nLoran de Munck fell short too, quite literally in his case as the Dutchman came off the horse mid-routine. He got back on to finish but his race was run. The only worry was if the extra delay would affect Ireland's great hope.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nMcClenaghan had ignored his competitors up to then, sitting 50 feet away looking straight ahead, a man engaged in his own thoughts and processes as he shook his arms until it was time to take to the mat himself.\n\nHis turn was clean and tight and his smile and punch of the air when he was done told us everything an inexpert eye could not. There were tears of joy even then, and more when his score of 15.533 appeared on the jumbo screens hanging from the roof.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik of the USA, world champion in 2021 before McClenaghan succeeded him with the next two titles, was up fifth. He wasn't wearing his trademark glasses but it was clear to see that he had impressed.\n\nNot quite enough, his 15.300 enough for third as it stood.

He didn't look at his phone, he wasn't talking to anybody else. For those moments it was just him, alone with his thoughts, trying to make sense of how the most crazy, ambitious of dreams sold 10 years earlier had somehow been realised.\n\n\"What I kept thinking last night, going to sleep, is that this has been such a personal journey.\n\n\"Like, everything that we've done from the very moment that me and Rhys linked up to this moment, I wrote down in 2014, and within it was every major title.\n\n\"I showed him, I showed his parents and I told him, and what I needed to do was to make them believe that it could happen. Because if I couldn't get them on board, it just wasn't possible... otherwise it's just this crazy guy saying things.\n\n\"But I saw a spark in him so young and I believed it - I truly, honestly believed it. And there was such a vulnerability in believing something that much because it's not guaranteed, obviously. Anything can happen, the margins of error are so small.\n\n\"But I truly, honestly believed with every fibre in my body, to the point where I visualised this so many times, it is like a dream I've had 30,000 times already, that it just felt like a jigsaw piece.\n\n\"It just went together perfectly.\"\n\nFor a 15-year-old to shun the typical trappings of teenage life, in exchange for a one in a million shot at pulling off something remarkable, requires a leap of faith beyond all comprehension.\n\nBut McClenaghan and Carson are, and always have been, so much more than gymnast and coach.\n\n\"It's hard to make it seem realistic back then but we saw a path - Luke clearly saw a path,\" said McClenaghan.\n\n\"It's not often I've heard him say 'I think this kid can be a world champion', but he said it for me... I owe Luke a lot. This is our medal and I'm proud it's that way.\"\n\nFrom July 15, the day they swapped Ireland for Paris, Carson was convinced that what unfolded on Saturday evening was already written. He had seen it day in, day out in training, far from crowded arenas and media glare.\n\nBut Tokyo was always there too. Because, coming into those Olympic Games three years ago, McClenaghan is in even more electrifying form on the pommel. His success rate was 100 per cent.\n\n\"That's unheard of,\" said Carson, \"he was absolutely on fire.\"\n\nAnd then, inside 10 seconds, it was over. The click of fingers, just like, what was supposed to be a dream turned into a nightmare.\n\nManaging the pressure of the situation, controlling only what affected him, those were the key factors in laying those demons to rest on Saturday.\n\n\"That's the maturity of him as an athlete... Tokyo taught him that. Tokyo taught him a hard lesson.\n\n\"You know, to be perfectly honest, Tokyo, from both of our point of views, was really traumatic. Like, I felt like a part of my soul died that day.\n\n\"But unfortunately, sometimes you need to make those mistakes of being almost intimidated by the big scores that have come out, and then the psychology switches slightly, then it's not just about me and my routine, it's 'I've got to beat this subjective score, it's out of my control'.\n\n\"And so from Tokyo to now has been an open, honest discussion that we can't control scores; it's completely out of our control, there's zero point in worrying about it or thinking about it.

Sinead O'Carroll Reports from Paris\n\nTHERE ARE SIX apparatus in men's gymnastics and Rhys McClenaghan, Newtownards pommel horse specialist, is the world's undeniable best on one of them.\n\nHowever, with back-to-back world championships and an Olympic gold medal, the 25-year-old is expanding his horizons.\n\nHis sights already set on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, he intends to compete on all six apparatus in the all-around competition, with hopes of medaling in at least one other individual final.\n\nHe confirmed, following a question from The 42 today, that not only will he contest the floor competition but that he will attempt vault, horizontal bar, parallel bars and rings as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Yeah doing floor, doing all-around - all six of the events in gymnastics - I want to do that mostly for fun,\" he explained, gold medal hanging around his neck, after meeting journalists at the Irish Cultural Centre in Paris.\n\n\"I enjoy it and I feel like, I'm glad I've accomplished this in pommel horse now and I can switch my focus a little bit to the other events and possibly help out a gymnastics team in Ireland and contribute in as many ways as possible.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that floor, where competitors do a range of tumbling lines, is his second strongest event but that once he mounts any of the apparatus, he wants his routines to be medal worthy.\n\n\"So floor definitely has that possibility but there's a lot of work to be done on it so hopefully I can start that soon,\" he continued.\n\nFloor would have some crossover with pommel given between tumbling passess, the athletes will show off a strength hold, flairs or other circle elements like those perfected by McClenaghan yesterday in the Bercy Arena.\n\nAsked by The 42 if he had watched that 15.533 routine back yet, he admitted it looked better than it felt.\n\nRead Next Related Reads 'I've got balls anyway': Q&A with Ireland's first ever Olympic medalist in gymnastics McClenaghan delivers what he promised on a magical night for Irish sport\n\n\"I felt like there was a couple of areas where I was a little bit off balance and I had to adjust a little bit but when I watched the routine back I disguised those little off-balance moments very well and kept my tight body, kept my legs together and kept my focus throughout the routine,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the score was definitely right for me, it was a personal best performance for me, as well as a personal best score.\"\n\nHowever, he knows LA 2028 will be an even more difficult task given all the finalists, bar retiring 31-year-old former Olympic champion Max Whitlock, will still be vying for medals.\n\n\"Max is now retired but I think everybody else in that final will continue and that's an exciting prospect because it means we'll all be back battling it out for years to come now. Certainly the other two guys on the podium, they both said they'd continue to LA so I look forward to other competitions where we'll be battling it out.\"\n\nWritten by Sinead O'Carroll and originally published on The 42 whose award-winning team produces original content that you won't find anywhere else: on GAA, League of Ireland, women's sport and boxing, as well as our game-changing rugby coverage, all with an Irish eye.

Any time there is a disappointment and then it's contrasted with a huge success it makes that success so more enjoyable.\n\n\"That is where that flood of emotion comes from because it justifies all the times that you've failed with that one little success and that's a great metaphor for life almost.\"\n\nHe explained how he had upped the difficulty level of the routine he had performed in Tokyo which was the difference between him finishing ahead or behind Nariman Kurbinov of Kazakhstan who won silver.\n\nHe had previously struggled to execute the harder routine in the build-up to the 2022 World Championships which he won.\n\nHe said: \"So the routine I went back to, the structure is the same, but pretty much the skill that was giving me issues before that World Championships had to go back into the routine if we were going to bump the difficulty up even more.\n\n\"So I performed the highest difficulty I've ever performed in that routine yesterday and it's what won me that title.\n\n\"You've just got to risk it for that top spot. That's how high the standard was.\n\n\"I have watched it back, yeah, and it looked better than it felt.\n\n\"I felt like there was a couple of areas where I was a little bit off balance and I had to adjust a little bit.\n\n\"But when I watched the routine back I disguised those little off-balance moments very well and kept my tight body, kept my legs together and kept my focus throughout the routine.\n\n\"I think the score was definitely right for me, it was a personal best performance for me as well as a personal best score.\n\n\"In Tokyo, the code of points changed, but it would have been the equivalent of a 6.4, I performed a 6.6 yesterday.\n\nWithout those two-tenths, his score would have dropped from 15.533 to 15.333 with Kurbinov getting 14.333 and bronze medallist Stephen Nedoroscik 15.300.\n\nMcClenaghan, 25, had a relatively early night after treating himself to a gin and tonic as the great and good congratulated him on his triumph.\n\nHe said: \"I slept well. I went to do RTE looking out over the Eiffel Tower which had a great view.\n\n\"Then we went to O'Sullivan's, the Team Ireland house.\n\n\"I got to see all the buzz, my friends and family and celebrate for a little while and then headed off to bed at 12:30.\n\n\"Jamie Dornan messaged me. I've never met him in person but he's messaged me a couple of times and messaged me yesterday as well.\n\n\"Dara \u00d3 Briain was there in O'Sullivan's. I met him which was great because I've been a long-time fan of his.\n\n\"He was at the final as well. It's incredible to see that Irish support coming out, to welcome another Olympic medal into the Irish team.\n\n\"I guess it just shows how proud people are to see another Irish person doing well.\n\n\"That is always reciprocated by me as well for any success that happens on this island. It makes me proud.\"\n\nIreland have enjoyed their best Games to date with three gold and two bronze and Kellie Harrington guaranteed at least silver.\n\nAnd he said: \"To contribute to that is always an honour, the more the merrier in my eyes.\n\n\"I wish the rest of the athletes success in the week to come, leading into the finish of the Olympic Games.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud to be a part of this team.\n\n\"It was such a nice team atmosphere in the Village this time around. I'm glad I got to experience that.\n\n\"It's been great to see that contrast of Tokyo and Paris, I'm now able to shake hands with the other Team Ireland athletes, congratulate people, have conversations with other people and get to know them very well and to see who is making up this team that is the most successful Irish Olympic team ever.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType":

Watch any Hollywood movie adapted from a book and you soon realise how much depth and nuance is left out as they prime and package that easy-to-follow and easy-to-swallow two-hour ride.\n\nStephen Spielberg's Jaws doesn't mention the affair between Chief Brody's wife and the marine scientist. Silence of the Lambs on screen omitted the death of Crawford's wife and Clarice Starling's relationship with Dr Pilcher.\n\nThink about everything you've heard and read about McClenaghan this last few days and ask if you've heard mention of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, or the European Championships in Munich. Both were held in 2022, both were as disappointing in their way as Tokyo.\n\nAnd both are absolutely foundational events in this story.\n\nA silver in the English midlands might not sound like a major reason for introspection - especially with Whitlock winning - but it fell short of expectations and it was a bigger blow for its proximity to Japan. Then he appeared at the Olympiahalle and failed to make it to the final.\n\nMcClenaghan scored 14.200 that day. Bear in mind the 15.533 he posted in Paris here and that tells its own story. Dozens of gymnasts still had to perform after him and he was finally edged out of the last, eighth qualifying position seven hours later.\n\n\"Achin,\" he tweeted from his hotel room.\n\nHe was World champion three months later and returned to Ireland that week and explained how he had done it. One aspect of his routine was catching him out. He wasn't quite nailing it and the risk/reward ratio demanded that it be dropped. So it was dropped.\n\nThat World title was defended 12 months later. He added two European titles with it, but that tricky routine couldn't be discarded forever, To go where he really wanted to go, to be an Olympic champion, he had to return to it and crack it.\n\nHe did that in Paris.\n\n\"So the routine I went back to, the structure is the same, but pretty much the skill that was giving me issues before that World Championships had to go back into the routine if we were going to bump the difficulty up even more.\n\n\"So I performed the highest difficulty I've ever performed in that routine [on Saturday] and it's what won me that title,\" he explained. \"You've just got to risk it for that top spot. That's how high the standard was.\" There came a point in the routine where two paths presented themselves.\n\nTake the easier one, the one he nailed in qualifying, and it would have given him a score of 15.200. But Nariman Kurbanov had already registered a 15.433. The other path was the only path. It delivered his best ever competitive score and an Olympic gold medal.\n\nHis difficulty rating in Tokyo was 6.4. Paris was 6.6. That's the difference between gold and silver.\n\n\"It shows I've got balls anyway,\" he laughed.\n\nJustin Spring, a bronze medallist with the USA in the All-Around in 2008, went viral online with his rising levels of incredulity as the routine developed.\n\n\"I thought he was going to take off on that one. That was perfect.\" \"Wow, that was so intricate.\" \"I really don't know what you take off for that routine.\" \"He did it. Oh man, he did it!\" Eurosport's commentator said she would have believed McClenaghan's legs had been glued together had she not seen him walk. Louis Smith, who McClenaghan had watched win medals in London in 2012 when barely a teenager, labelled it the greatest Pommel display he had ever seen.\n\nMcClenaghan got to meet Smith in the mixed zone afterwards. It was \"mad,\" he said, to meet the Englishman at that very moment when it had been Smith who had served as the inspiration for his entire career. It all added to the perfect day.\n\nHe looked down more than once at the gold medal hanging around his neck and marvelled at how there was an actual piece of the Eiffel Tower embedded in it, and about how much he loves the city of Paris. It all felt like the pieces had fallen into place.\n\nThere were yet more eloquent words about the mental health journey he has been on, how he has limited his social media, found every scintilla of joy in the journey and daily life, and how he would have still been fulfilled had the outcome been different at the weekend.\n\nWhat he didn't say was that it had been in that very same Bercy Arena, in the autumn of last year, where he had experienced what he later termed was his first panic attack, just weeks before he defended his World title in Antwerp.\n\nSo, yeah, Tokyo to Paris has a lot to sell it on the big screen. But it's only when we pick up the book and take time to read each page, with Birmingham and Munich and Liverpool and Bercy in the early autumn of 2023, that the full story gets told.", "source":

Did any of you have the maddest of dreams last night about Ireland winning a medal on each and every one of the last six days at these Olympic Games, the latest a gold for Rhys McClenaghan on Saturday? And then you woke up and realised it all actually happened? Same here. We're in pinch-yerself territory. We've already matched our highest ever medal haul, achieved at London 2012 ..... with a whole week to go.\n\nLest you forget: Monday: Mona McSharry (bronze). Tuesday: Daniel Wiffen (gold). Wednesday: Kellie Harrington (bronze, at least... and now with another shot at gold). Thursday: Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch (bronze). Friday: Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy (gold). Saturday: Rhys McClenaghan (gold). Sunday: No pressure at all, Daniel Wiffen, but it would be very nice if you could keep this daily dose of delight going in this afternoon's 1,500m freestyle final (5.37pm).\n\nBut after the glut of Irish activity the last week, we have a slightly quieter day today with a mere 11 of our team in action. Among the day's highlights are finals in the men's 100m in athletics, the women's 50m freestyle in swimming, and in the men's singles in tennis and table tennis.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Doyle_(rower)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philip Doyle (rower)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellie_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kellie Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_O'Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul O'Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintan_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fintan McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Table tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/J73GSWCFO5CNNMSMX37X5GHEDM.jpg?smart=true&auth=708a2e194264c5f0e91aa38feeedd411ea650dc4cea3376863c517d1a3ab0bbe&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9787863", "eventUri": "eng-9787863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

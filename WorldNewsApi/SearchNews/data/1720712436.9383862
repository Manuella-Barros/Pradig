The Mets entered Sunday\u2019s game against their NL East rival nine games under .500, just over seven weeks from the trade deadline. \u201cI know everybody\u2019s focused on the trade deadline. That\u2019s all anybody wants to talk about,\u201d Cohen said after posing for photos at the podium with shortstop Francisco Lindor. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of games to play. Let\u2019s get focused on what\u2019s happening now. We\u2019ve got to chip away.\u201d Cohen, who bought the team ahead of the 2021 season, interacted with fans during the London trip. \u201cThey came over here because they love the Mets, they care about the Mets,\u201d said Cohen, wearing a Mets cap and blue vest. \u201cThey\u2019re in good spirits. I was hanging out with them in the pub. We were having a blast. The fans have been through worse. We\u2019re trying to break that history. They\u2019re great and they\u2019re certainly going to be there for the team.\u201d New York has won just two World Series titles, in 1969 and 1986. Cohen, who took over from the Wilpon and Katz families, said the Mets are improving institutionally and decision-making has become \u201ca lot sharper.\u201d David Stearns was hired as president of baseball operations in October after running the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 baseball operations for seven years through 2022. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for David. He comes from a winning club, he\u2019s demonstrated success in the past, well-respected in baseball,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI like what I see but unfortunately it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d Mendoza was hired last November to replace Buck Showalter after six seasons as a major league coach with the New York Yankees. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by Carlos. He\u2019s got incredible rapport with the team, he\u2019s thoughtful. He\u2019s very capable of relating to the players, delivering hard messages when he has to,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by how he conducts himself.\u201d The Mets were an expensive flop in 2023, finishing fourth in the NL East after beginning the year with World Series aspirations following a 101-win season and a playoff appearance. Ahead of last season\u2019s trade deadline, the team traded star pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander and several other veterans for minor league prospects. The Mets said they were pointing toward 2025 while still looking to compete in 2024. In March, Cohen said \u201c the goal is to make the playoffs \u201d this season. \u201cI do think the team is starting to play better, starting to hit. I\u2019m starting to see green shoots,\u201d Cohen said Sunday. The team\u2019s defense has been a surprise, he added, a day after right fielder Starling Marte didn\u2019t get to a pop fly with two outs in the fourth inning with the game tied 1-1. The Phillies rallied for five more runs in that inning. When Cohen was asked about the \u201c bouncy turf \" at London Stadium, he pointed to that key play from Saturday. \u201cThe fly ball that fell in front of Starling yesterday \u2014 that was pretty high,\u201d he said. Marte had said he couldn\u2019t track the ball off the bat because of the sun. He wasn\u2019t in Sunday\u2019s lineup, but Mendoza said the plan coming into London was to limit Marte to one game because of a knee issue the 35-year-old two-time All-Star mentioned before the trip. Cohen also shot down the notion that Mets players were jet lagged: \u201cIt didn\u2019t affect Philadelphia yesterday. ... These guys are used to traveling.\u201d It can be hard to pinpoint exactly why a team underperforms, Cohen suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s the variability of human performance. You can write it down on paper but then you\u2019ve got to play the games. Frankly, we haven\u2019t really put it all together for a consistent period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI still think that can happen. There\u2019s a lot of good ballplayers on this club. It\u2019s just a question of getting a little confidence, getting on a run. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what it looks like four to six weeks from now. The locker room is good, the culture is good. So I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N0ZXZlLWNvaGVuLW1ldHMtN2MxMDc4Y2FjYjM5MDk1ODc3MmEyYTg5MWY1MGRkODnSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Mets owner Steve Cohen says fans 'have been through worse,' eyes turnaround</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/steve-cohen-mets-7c1078cacb390958772a2a891f50dd89", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/693dd52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5481x3083+0+285/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F48%2Fbc%2F84aaa95e95c54e587be8a8613f17%2Fe12a6cbd6a7f4a65b59e05b7e1ee362a", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:41:38", "author": "Ken Maguire", "authors": ["Ken Maguire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.253}

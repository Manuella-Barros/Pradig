Calafiori had been on the Gunners' radar long before the 2024 European Championship (EURO 2024) but his performances in Germany accelerated the process.\n\nAfter narrowly missing out on the 2023-24 Premier League title, Arsenal are preparing to try again in 2024-25. They, however, understand their current squad is not capable of keeping pace with Manchester City, which is why they are working on bolstering key areas in the summer transfer window. According to reports, the North London side want to add a top center-forward to their ranks, whereas a versatile defender is also on their wishlist.\n\nWhile Arsenal have yet to identify a primary target for the center-forward position, they seemingly have zeroed in on Calafiori to bolster their defense. The 22-year-old can play both as a center-back and a left-back, meaning Arsenal will not only have a high-flying full-back to take the reins from Oleksandr Zinchenko and Jakub Kiwior, they will also get a competent cover for William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes at the heart of the defense.\n\nIt has been a few days since Arsenal and Bologna started discussing Calafiori's transfer, but the deal has yet to conclude. This has made many skeptical about the transfer, with some reports suggesting the Londoners are not confident due to Calafiori's injury history.\n\nRomano, however, has claimed the deal is on the right track, revealing the player has agreed to join the Premier League side on a five-year deal. In his Daily Briefing column for CaughtOffside, Romano revealed:\n\n\"Negotiations are still ongoing between Arsenal and Bologna for Riccardo Calafiori.\n\n\"It's not a done deal yet between clubs, only done on player side with a five-year contract agreed but still discussing the fee, deal structure, add-ons, and more. We can just wait and see what happens between Arsenal and Bologna. Calafiori wants Arsenal and is waiting for Arsenal.\"\n\nCalafiori, who claimed an assist in three matches for Italy in EURO 2024, has played 33 games for Bologna since joining them last summer, scoring twice and providing five assists.

Mikel Arteta has truly transformed the club and has turned them into serious contenders for both, the Premier League and the Champions League titles.\n\nArsenal, however, haven't won either trophy yet. To go the distance, they need to strengthen their squad, and Arteta and Edu Gaspar are working hard behind the scenes.\n\nApart from turning David Raya's loan into a permanent deal, the North Londoners haven't signed anyone in this window yet. That could change very soon.\n\nHow Juventus are feeling after Arsenal hijack Riccardo Calafiori move\n\nArsenal look like the favourites to sign Riccardo Calafiori this summer.\n\nThe Gunners were expected to strengthen the left side of their defence in this window, but the Italian defender wasn't a name that was heavily linked for a long time.\n\nHowever, after a fine Euro 2024 campaign, things changed and Arsenal reached an agreement in principle to sign Calafiori from Bologna in this window.\n\nIt looks really likely now that the Italian will end up at the Emirates Stadium, with reports claiming on Monday that Arsenal could sign Calafiori within 48 hours.\n\nThat is great news if you're a Gooner, but if you're someone associated with Juventus, you probably have your head in your hands.\n\nThe Bianconeri have been chasing Calafiori for months and GiveMeSport claim they even had an agreement in place with the Italian over a summer move.\n\nHowever, once Arsenal entered the race and Arteta spoke to Calafiori, his head was turned, and the report claims Juventus have been 'left in despair' because of the Gunners hijacking their deal.\n\nAn agreement between the clubs hasn't been reached yet, but Arsenal have been described as the 'frontrunners' for Calafiori's signature and a \u00a343 million bid should seal the deal.\n\nREAD MORE: Two key reasons why Riccardo Calafiori is 'in love' with joining Arsenal\n\nArsenal finally get their revenge on Juventus\n\nJuventus will not be happy about missing out on Calafiori.\n\nHistory over the last decade will tell you that the Bianconeri are always the favourites to sign an Italian player in the Serie A - even though English clubs are capable of offering way more money.\n\nMikel Arteta learned this the hard way a few years ago when Manuel Locatelli refused to join Arsenal in the summer of 2021. He ended up at Juventus in the same window.\n\nThere were fears that Arsenal's move for Calafiori could become 'Locatelli 2.0', but all signs point towards the Gunners winning the race this time.\n\nIf it does happen, Arsenal will finally get their revenge on Juventus, and they should be really happy as Calafiori's ceiling is a lot higher than Locatelli's ever was.", "source": {"uri": "arsenalinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arsenal Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shamanth_jayaram@arsenalinsider.com", "name": "Shamanth Jayaram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edu_(footballer,_born_1978)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edu (footballer, born 1978)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Locatelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Locatelli"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn1.arsenalinsider.com/uploads/19/2024/07/GettyImages-2149333664-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716300", "eventUri": "eng-9716300", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Calafiori could replace left-back Kieran Tierney or provide backup to the centre-back duo of William Saliba and Gabriel. Personal terms have been agreed, and Arsenal are now focusing on a fee and deal structure with Bologna.\n\nArsenal's move to Riccardo Calafiori appears to be heading in all of the right directions as the Gunners look to pursue a deal for the breakthrough Italian star - and Fabrizio Romano has exclusively told GIVEMESPORT that whilst a deal hasn't been done just yet, talks between the clubs are now on a 'daily basis'.\n\nThe Gunners are looking to spend money yet again in the transfer window, with a whole host of stars coming through to their first-team in recent years including the likes of Declan Rice, Kai Havertz and David Raya. But the north London outfit are looking ahead, and with Calafiori being linked, a deal appears to be edging closer to completion with talks now at a daily stage.\n\nCalafiori Has Been Linked With Arsenal The Italian has been in great form for Bologna and Italy\n\nReports earlier in the transfer window suggested that Juventus were leading the race to sign the Italian centre-back after his outstanding season at Bologna, with the Turin-based outfit being Calafiori's 'first choice' of club was he to move on.\n\nHowever those rumours have not developed, and after an outstanding EURO 2024 campaign with Italy other clubs have stolen the march, including Arsenal.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's Serie A statistics - Bologna squad ranking\n\nStats\n\nOutput\n\nSquad rank\n\nAppearances\n\n30\n\n=10th\n\nAssists\n\n5\n\n1st\n\nClearances Per Game\n\n2.5\n\n3rd\n\nTackles Per Game\n\n1.6\n\n=5th\n\nInterceptions Per Game\n\n1.7\n\n1st\n\nMatch rating\n\n6.99\n\n2nd\n\nThe Gunners have reportedly agreed personal terms with the former Roma talent on a wage of around \u00a365,000-per-week, and all that is left to do is agree a fee with Bologna in the hope of landing their man with a few weeks for him to meet the squad in pre-season before playing a key role next season.\n\nRomano: Arsenal and Bologna Negotiating \"Daily\" The two clubs are closing in on an agreement\n\nSpeaking exclusively to GIVEMESPORT, Romano revealed that negotiations were underway on a daily basis between Arsenal and Basel - though the Italian suggested that there are still issues to iron out despite personal terms being agreed. He said:\n\n\"The negotiation is underway now between Arsenal and Bologna. There's still no agreement whilst there has been talks between the two clubs, but they are negotiating on a daily basis to reach and agreement on the structure of the deal - on the fee, and all the details needed, including the 50 per cent of the deal to Basel.\n\n\"There are some points to clarify between the clubs, but there is an agreement with the player on a five-year contract until 2029, [which is] \u20ac4million (\u00a33.4million) net salary per season.\"\n\nCalafiori May Not Play Centre-Back for Arsenal There are other pressing issues to iron out in defence\n\nCalafiori's main position is centre-back, and it will be tough for him to oust William Saliba and Gabriel from the heart of the defence if that is where Mikel Arteta has signed him for.\n\nThe duo formed the meanest defence in the Premier League last season with just 29 goals conceded throughout the league campaign, and with Saliba still developing as a young centre-back alongside Gabriel being a couple of years from hitting his peak, it wouldn't be the wisest idea in the world for them to break that up.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Riccardo Calafiori only joined Bologna from Basel last season\n\nInstead, Calafiori could slot into the left-back role as well as offering immense backup to the centre-back pairing. Oleksandr Zinchenko wasn't at his best for the Gunners last season, and with Kieran Tierney likely to move on in the summer alongside Jakub Kiwior, Calafiori's arrival would be highly heralded at the Emirates Stadium in the inverted full-back role Arteta loves to utilise.\n\nRelated Arsenal Considering Move for Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze\n\nThe Englishman could provide cover for both Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard should he make the cross-London switch.\n\nStatistics courtesy of WhoScored.

Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko are the most obvious candidates, with the former looking more plausible at present because -- despite his popularity at Arsenal -- the Poland international appears to be generating more interest, particularly from Italy.\n\nBeing a left-footed centre-back would make Calafiori a valuable addition to Arsenal, as would his versatility. Before joining Bologna, he often played left-back for Basel and could do the same at Arsenal if Arteta wanted to play him with Gabriel and William Saliba.\n\nCalafiori displayed some of these traits last season, with one of the Bologna midfielders often dropping deep to allow the Italian to bomb forward on the left, out wide and centrally. This was a key reason behind Calafiori getting three assists in 30 Serie A appearances. It could be replicated at Arsenal if he plays at left-back, though he will have more defensive work to do.\n\nA look at Calafiori's defensive and passing stats from last season suggests he was some distance clear of his competition.\n\nWhile performing better than Gabriel in most of these metrics, he also had the same number of goal-creating actions per 90 as Oleksandr Zinchenko (0.3) and more switches of play than Gabriel, Saliba and Zinchenko combined (0.6 vs 0.4).\n\nCalafiori is also confident on the ball, with his 49.5 carries and 1.1 carries into the final third per 90 ranking him in the top 12 per cent of defenders respectively in Serie A. He has an innate ability to attack open space, completing 62 per cent of his take-ons.\n\nHowever, he ranked in the bottom 11 per cent in times dispossessed (0.5) and bottom two per cent in miscontrols (1.2) per 90, while his 1.3 fouls per 90 was marginally over the league average of 1.2.\n\nThese are fixable issues given Calafiori is only 22 and the positive attributes of his game suggest this would be a shrewd signing by Arsenal.\n\nAnantaajith Raghuraman\n\nAs reported in Italy and as referenced above by David Ornstein, Arsenal are interested in Bologna defender Riccardo Calafiori. The Italy international would like to move to the Premier League and is keen to join Arsenal if a deal can be agreed. There are, however, significant obstacles to be overcome: his price is inflated by a good European Championship and a sizeable sell-on fee would be due to his former club Basel.\n\nThere is also the issue of Calafiori's history of serious knee problems (see graph below). It remains to be seen whether Arteta's belief in the player will overcome any possible fitness concerns.\n\nArsenal have also contacted Wolves to express an interest in 30-year-old goalkeeper Dan Bentley. They need cover for David Raya, who has now joined the club permanently from Brentford.\n\nArsenal sold 21-year-old striker Mika Biereth to Sturm Graz \u00a34milllion -- a club-record fee for the Austrian club. Arsenal also retain a sell-on clause for the Denmark Under-21 international's next move.\n\nArsenal have a surfeit of left-sided defenders on the books. Loanees Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares remain available for permanent transfer, but Arsenal may also have to dispense with a player who has until now been part of Arteta's plans.\n\nZinchenko has two years remaining on his contract but has not yet been offered a new deal, which indicates that Arsenal may be prepared to sell him. There's also the possibility that Arsenal could cash in on Poland international Jakub Kiwior, who has admirers in Italy.\n\nAs well as a left-sided defender, Arsenal want a central midfielder. One player of interest is Real Sociedad's Mikel Merino, who headed Spain's late winner in their Euro 2024 quarter-final win over Germany.\n\nArteta is an admirer of the former Newcastle man's talent and physicality. Merino turned 28 in June, which would place him outside of Arsenal's typical recruitment profile. The relative youth of the squad, however, means they can add more experienced players when required, as they did with Jorginho and Leandro Trossard.\n\nVeiga, a 20-year-old midfielder, has flown to London for a medical ahead of joining up with new head coach Enzo Maresca's squad for pre-season training at the club's Cobham base, and his transfer will be formally announced soon. Sporting Lisbon, the club he left to join Basel, are due 10 per cent of the final fee.\n\nThat was not the only potential arrival under discussion.\n\nTalks have continued with Argentina's Boca Juniors over a deal worth around \u00a317million, plus add-ons, for 19-year-old defender Aaron Anselmino, who is expected to spend at least the next six months on loan back at the Buenos Aires club.\n\nLate on Monday, an agreement in principle was reached to sign Atlanta United's USMNT left-back Caleb Wiley, also 19.\n\nThe United States international is expected to join for a fee of around \u00a38.5m and on a contract until June 2031. Wiley is set to be sent on loan to Strasbourg next season for regular first-team football.\n\nIn terms of outgoings, Cobham graduate Michael Golding has signed for Leicester City in a deal worth \u00a35million.\n\nTargeted by Chelsea's recruitment team in part because of his suitability for Maresca's preferred system, Veiga is a tall (190cm/6ft 3in), technically adept left-sided defender capable of playing left-back, centre-back and defensive midfield. Maresca wants full-backs who can invert into midfield when Chelsea have possession and Veiga, along with Marc Cucurella, is viewed as being able to perform this role from the left.\n\nChelsea pursued the deal quietly while being repeatedly linked with Bologna's Italy international defender Riccardo Calafiori, and regarded the younger, cheaper Veiga as a much better value proposition.\n\nIt is not yet decided if Veiga will have an immediate first-team role. Maresca will work with him in pre-season and assess whether he is ready to contribute this season or needs a loan spell to aid his development. But his arrival is a further indication, following the \u00a330million signing of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Leicester, that Chelsea are recruiting with Maresca in mind -- even beyond his upcoming debut season.\n\nChelsea are still looking to strengthen at left-winger and striker, but there is less incentive to conduct business quickly now June 30, a date so important for staying within profit and sustainability rules (PSR) has passed. Nico Williams is the highest-profile option to upgrade their left wing. Chelsea, however, are well aware they are not the only big club interested in Athletic Bilbao's 21-year-old Spain international, who has shone at Euro 2024.\n\nFirm decisions are likely to be made during the club's five-game pre-season tour of the United States, starting against Wrexham on July 24, with more expensive purchases partly contingent on raising further money from sales.\n\nChelsea are highly motivated to offload Romelu Lukaku, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Malang Sarr, while Armando Broja, Cesare Casadei, David Datro Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah could also depart. Gallagher's future is also up in the air, with Atletico one club known to be interested.\n\nThe only member of the first-team squad available for loan is 20-year-old defender Alfie Gilchrist, who has interest from several clubs, including Serie A new boys Como, where former Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas is the assistant manager.\n\nOn the academy front, Chelsea do not want to sell attacking midfielder Alex Matos and will look to send him on a season-long loan. Several clubs have expressed an interest in borrowing the 19-year-old for 2024-25, including some in the Championship, where he spent the second half of the last campaign with Huddersfield Town, but also in France's Ligue 1 and the German Bundesliga.\n\nAnother leading under-21s prospect, 19-year-old midfielder Leo Castledine, is the subject of enquiries from clubs in the second-tier Championship and League One, the third division of English football. over a season-long loan.\n\nLiam Twomey, Dan Sheldon and Adam Leventhal\n\nArne Slot was officially unveiled, and the new head coach talked up the depth of talent he has inherited from Jurgen Klopp. With the Dutchman keen to fully assess the squad during pre-season, sporting director Richard Hughes indicated that transfer business is more likely to take place later in the window.\n\nThe club also landed a windfall of around \u00a32million after the completion of Kamil Grabara's transfer from Copenhagen to Wolfsburg. A fee of around \u00a311.4m was agreed last year but the Polish goalkeeper's move from Denmark to Germany only became official at the start of July. Liverpool inserted a 20 per cent sell-on clause in the deal when they sold Grabara to Copenhagen for around \u00a33million in 2021. Grabara left Anfield without making a competitive senior appearance.\n\nBackup goalkeeper Adrian confirmed he was leaving Liverpool following the end of his contract. The 37-year-old was offered a one-year extension but has opted to rejoin boyhood club Real Betis in La Liga. The 22-year-old 'keeper Vitezslav Jaros will be promoted to Slot's senior squad to provide cover for Alisson and Caoimhin Kelleher.\n\nThiago took the decision to bring the curtain down on his illustrious career. The Spanish midfielder had been considering his options since waving goodbye to Anfield in May. His final season at Liverpool was wrecked by a hip problem.\n\nThe wait for the first signing of the Slot era goes on, but Liverpool's new backroom staff is coming together. Former Manchester City analyst Aaron Briggs has been appointed as the club's new elite development coach, while the former Everton defender Johnny Heitinga is also in talks over a coaching role.\n\nLiverpool continue to consider their options following the departure of centre-back Joel Matip as a free agent at the end of last season. They retain a strong interest in Lille's Leny Yoro but expect Real Madrid to secure the 18-year-old French defender's signature. The situation will be influenced by what happens with outgoings.\n\nSepp van den Berg, who returned to Liverpool this summer after a successful loan spell at German club Mainz, has impressed Slot during the opening stages of pre-season.\n\nSlot is determined to give the 22-year-old opportunities to prove himself during the upcoming tour of America when centre-backs Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez are all set to be missing following their involvement in the Euros.\n\nLiverpool have already turned down offers from Mainz and Wolfsburg for Van den Berg, who they value at around \u00a320million.\n\nAs well as a centre-back, a defensive midfielder and an attacking wide player have also been discussed.\n\nHowever, with a youthful squad packed with potential, it was never going to be a busy summer for Liverpool in terms of incomings. Much depends on who steps up during pre-season and what gaps still need to be filled.\n\n\"We need to improve on the training pitch, first and foremost. And with the window open we will always be opportunistic if we can,\" Hughes said.\n\nNat Phillips' eight-year stay at Liverpool will be coming to an end. The 27-year-old defender, who has entered the final year of his contract, was the subject of a \u00a34million bid from Turkish club Trabzonspor, but Liverpool are holding out for \u00a38m to \u00a310m. Phillips is also attracting interest from several Championship clubs, including Scott Parker's Burnley.\n\nIt remains to be seen if a club will test Liverpool's resolve to keep \u00a325m-rated goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, who is desperate to become a No 1 after a long stint as Alisson's deputy.\n\nLuis Diaz has also been linked with a summer exit, but Liverpool have not had any offers for him and are not looking to sell the Colombian.\n\nJames Pearce\n\nKevin De Bruyne stated he will have a \"quiet summer\" and will continue at City for another season, but that did not stop reports of him agreeing a deal with Al Ittihad of Saudi Arabia. As reported in last week's DealSheet, the club expect De Bruyne, now 33 and out of contract at the end of the coming campaign, to stay this summer.\n\nThat is also the case for Ederson, although there were reports last week that he has reached an agreement with another Saudi side, Al Nassr. The Brazilian goalkeeper's future has been subject to speculation since the final weeks of last season: it had appeared in the spring he was set to sign a new contract, but that became more doubtful as the campaign drew to a close.\n\nSources close to Ederson felt he was ready to make a move to the Middle East around that period and every week brings new reports about his future. City have been exploring the goalkeeper market, although that was largely driven by uncertainty around No 2 Stefan Ortega's own situation.\n\nThe Athletic has reported City had reached an agreement with a goalkeeper to come in and be their backup if Ortega left but, in the end, he signed a new contract last month.\n\nCity are not expecting to have to bring in any major replacements this summer, including for De Bruyne and Ederson, as well as Bernardo Silva, but there is certainly some clarity needed around their No 1 goalkeeper.\n\nThe situation with Joao Cancelo now is what it has been for the past 18 months: City do not have him as part of their plans for next season and want him to move on. They would prefer a permanent transfer but know there are very few takers, so another loan is most likely after he spent last season with Barcelona.\n\nClubs know City do not have much leverage in this situation and that they can afford to haggle, which could mean another loan with no obligation to buy Cancelo at the end of it. Manager Pep Guardiola would not want the Portugal international around his squad if he has no chance of playing, so City will have to agree to something.\n\nAs revealed last week, City are looking to do business this summer but are not expecting to have to replace any major names. So there will not be a huge amount of movement.\n\nBruno Guimaraes is the big target in midfield but City had no intention of triggering the \u00a3100million buyout clause in his Newcastle United contract, and so that is a situation that is likely to drag on. City, though, do recognise the need to get somebody in to alleviate the pressure on Rodri. Joshua Kimmich of Bayern Munich and Germany also remains an option.\n\nCity are still exploring a move for a right-winger, and they could sign a left-back to replace Sergio Gomez, who is bound for Real Sociedad in Spain. Although given Gomez did not play too much, his replacement may not be a regular first-team contender.\n\nJeremie Frimpong, a former City academy graduate now at German champions Bayer Leverkusen, is of interest -- but that would depend on Kyle Walker's future and, as with Ederson and De Bruyne, City are not expecting too much to happen on that front.\n\nIt was reported on Monday that both City and Tottenham Hotspur are ready to trigger the \u00a360m release clause in Eberechi Eze's Crystal Palace contract but while City strongly considered signing the player last summer, they are not currently planning a move ahead of the new season.\n\nMatheus Nunes could move to the Saudi Pro League if interest in him is made concrete, as City would be willing to sell to bring in funds and reduce the number of players competing for midfield places, should reinforcements arrive.\n\nJulian Alvarez has also attracted interest from several clubs, and it is understood he would welcome a move, but there has not been too much movement.\n\nSam Lee\n\nIn terms of confirmed ins and out, still nothing yet. The matter of Erik ten Hag's contract was finally resolved last week though, with United triggering the one-year extension option in his existing deal.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy, Rene Hake and Jelle ten Rouwelaar are expected to join Ten Hag's coaching staff and attended Carrington on Monday, but they did not take part in the first day of training as they are still awaiting work visas and the confirmation of their appointments.\n\nTen Rouwelaar is expected to join as Ten Hag's new goalkeeping coach as United finalise a compensation deal with Ajax, who the 43-year-old had agreed to join from Burnley. He will be working with Tom Heaton, who signed a new one-year contract last week to extend his stay for another season as United's third-choice goalkeeper.\n\nWhat's the latest with Zirkzee and De Ligt?\n\nThe past week has seen significant progress in the pursuit of Joshua Zirkzee, with United reaching an agreement on personal terms, including a five-year deal, and agent commission for the Bologna forward.\n\nA move for Zirkzee is now close, but United are still weighing up whether to pay the Netherlands international's \u20ac40million release clause or to negotiate and structure a deal differently. The \u20ac40m clause must be paid in full if it is triggered, which could be an issue for United from a cash-flow perspective.\n\nMore clarity is expected on that front when the club release their results for the third quarter of the financial year, up to the end of March, on Wednesday.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt of Bayern Munich is still the likeliest addition in the centre of defence, despite United's interest in Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite and Lille's Leny Yoro. United have made an improved \u00a345million plus \u00a35m in add-ons offer for Branthwaite, but the offer falls far below Everton's valuation of the England international and is firmly expected to be rejected.\n\nDe Ligt is viewed as a replacement for Raphael Varane, who left as a free agent upon the expiry of his contract.\n\nUnited remain in club-to-club talks for De Ligt with Bayern, which were initiated last week. Negotiations over the 24-year-old's personal terms are not expected to provide an obstacle.\n\nThe deals for both Zirkzee and De Ligt could accelerate this week if the Netherlands go out of the European Championship after their semi-final against England on Wednesday, with medicals then possible.\n\nAs mentioned above, United have made an improved offer for Everton centre-back Branthwaite, though it is expected to be rejected.\n\nDespite progress in negotiations for Zirkzee, the 23-year-old might not be the only addition United make to their front line this summer.\n\nWith Zirkzee capable of playing as a wide forward as well as a striker -- in a similar vein to the outgoing Anthony Martial -- there remains scope for United to sign a recognised No 9 to provide support for Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nClub finances mean major sales would need to take place to add another forward, but the prospect has not been totally ruled out given United scored only 58 and 57 Premier League goals in Ten Hag's two campaigns.\n\nInternally, talks have taken place about Ivan Toney and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who each have one year remaining on their contracts. Both have indicated they will not be signing fresh terms at their clubs and are looking to move.\n\nBrentford are thought to want \u00a360m for Toney, 28, but some believe they might accept a figure closer to \u00a340m. Everton's financial situation means they are open to selling Calvert-Lewin, 27, this summer rather than risk him leaving for free in 2025. A deal around the \u00a330m mark is viewed as plausible.\n\nCalvert-Lewin's injury record is a consideration, but United figures have noted he featured in 38 games last season, playing 18 more minutes than Hojlund in the Premier League overall, and scored seven goals.\n\nUnited are also looking for a left-sided defender who could provide cover for Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw given their injury issues last season, with Tyrell Malacia still working his way back to fitness, too.\n\nFeyenoord's David Hancko, 26, who can operate at centre-back or full-back, has been considered, but he may prove too expensive for someone likely to be a squad player.\n\nAs well as up front and at centre-back, United would ideally like to strengthen in central midfield and are considering Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte, but loan options are also being seriously contemplated.\n\nDonny van de Beek is closing in on a move to Girona, in an initial \u20ac500,000 deal which could rise to a total of \u20ac20m with add-ons. Around \u20ac5m of those add-ons are viewed as realistically achievable.\n\nMason Greenwood attended a meeting at Carrington on Monday with members of the United hierarchy to discuss resuming his career away from the club. The 22-year-old did not train and, for now, there is no expectation he will rejoin the first-team squad while the club work on securing a possible exit.\n\nMarseille and Lazio have submitted firm offers for Greenwood and are in advanced talks. Juventus, Napoli, Benfica and Borussia Dortmund are among the other clubs to express an interest. Valencia also submitted a proposal, which did not meet United's demands.\n\nUnited are still open to offers for Jadon Sancho, but nothing is currently advanced with potential suitors. As with Greenwood, a permanent sale, loan or return all remain possible outcomes. Sancho staying would be dependent on an apology to Ten Hag.\n\nMark Critchley and Laurie Whitwell\n\nPaul Mitchell was announced last week as Newcastle's sporting director, following a more-than four-month search.\n\nWith a compensation package finally agreed with Manchester United to release Dan Ashworth at the end of June, Newcastle were able to appoint a successor. Mitchell, who has held similar positions at Tottenham Hotspur and Monaco, had initially distanced himself when Newcastle reached out in April, but communication was reopened and the 42-year-old's surprise appointment was confirmed on Thursday.\n\nDespite reports continuing to link Anthony Gordon with an exit, following an enquiry from boyhood club Liverpool earlier in the summer, Newcastle have no interest in selling the 23-year-old England international. Talks over an improved contract may be opened once Gordon returns following his Euro 2024 involvement, with head coach Eddie Howe keen to reassure the forward his ambitions can be achieved on Tyneside.\n\nNewcastle believe Mitchell represents a genuine coup and part of his remit includes a greater focus on recruitment than Ashworth had. Whereas Ashworth is renowned for his holistic approach as a sporting director, Mitchell's background as a former scout appealed to Newcastle and means he can offer specialist support to the recruitment department.\n\nMitchell will work closely with Steve Nickson, the head of recruitment, and Andy Howe, the assistant head of recruitment -- the pair who have identified Newcastle's list of targets for this summer. Eddie Howe has then confirmed his preferred options.\n\nThe hope inside Newcastle earlier this summer was that, once a new sporting director arrived, they would look to act upon a blueprint which had already been determined. Mitchell is set to hold conversations with key members of staff to discuss the plan for the remainder of a window which shuts on August 30.\n\nTheir priorities are centre-back, right-winger and another forward, although the latter may depend on whether Callum Wilson leaves. Newcastle are also reassessing their recruitment plans following the PSR deadline fallout at the end of June.\n\nHowever, Howe is keen to bolster Newcastle's right wing, with much of their budget expected to be spent on that position. Newcastle retain an interest in Nottingham Forest's Anthony Elanga, while Noni Madueke of Chelsea and West Ham United's Jarrod Bowen are among other options to have been discussed.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin had been a target but, after Newcastle failed to agree personal terms with the centre-forward, a deal with Everton collapsed. That transfer will not be revived unless Wilson moves on, and even then Newcastle may look to other options.\n\nAnother defender is also needed, given Sven Botman and Jamaal Lascelles are going to be sidelined for most of 2024 recovering from injuries. Newcastle want a right-sided centre-back who can be a long-term successor for Fabian Schar, who turns 33 in December. AC Milan's Malick Thiaw, a 22-year-old Germany international who Newcastle have long tracked, has been linked.\n\nThe arrivals of Odysseas Vlachodimos and John Ruddy mean the club currently have five senior goalkeepers. Newcastle have not yet followed up with their interest in James Trafford, despite opening talks with Burnley last month. Howe is set to appraise his goalkeepers during pre-season and, with last season's No 2 Martin Dubravka expected to leave, the recruitment of another player at the position has not been entirely ruled out.\n\nNewcastle are expected to continue to reduce the average age of their squad, with further senior players to depart, though there is no longer a pressing need to move people out for PSR reasons.\n\nOne of Mitchell's first tasks is to evaluate the player pool, especially the 12 players who are now into the last 12 months of their contracts. Miguel Almiron may leave if a right-winger joins, with Saudi Pro League clubs showing tentative interest in the Paraguayan, while Wilson, Sean Longstaff, Kieran Trippier and Emil Krafth are into the final year of their deals and exits have been explored. Nothing is agreed for any of those, however.\n\nNewcastle hope to offload Jamal Lewis and Ryan Fraser, with the latter having agreed a deal with promoted Southampton, though the details must be finalised with his current club. Isaac Hayden is available. If that trio are not sold by the end of the week, some, if not all, may be sent to train with the under-21s when pre-season commences.\n\nBruno Guimaraes' \u00a3100million release clause has now expired and Newcastle are keen to keep hold of the Brazil midfielder, while they have no intention of selling Alexander Isak. There is confidence Gordon will stay, despite internal fears that his head has been turned by an awareness of Liverpool's interest.\n\nChris Waugh\n\nEmerson Royal is one of the faces back at Hotspur Way this week for pre-season training but his long-term future is unclear. Spurs are open to selling the 25-year-old but have rejected an offer from AC Milan. The Italian side bid \u20ac10million for the defender, which is below Tottenham's valuation.\n\nManor Solomon has been involved in pre-season training too. Solomon joined Spurs from Shakhtar Donetsk last year and made six appearances in all competitions before he suffered a knee injury in training in October which ruled him out for the rest of the campaign. The winger had surgery on the meniscus in his right knee in March and will be hoping to build up his fitness in pre-season so he can make a bigger impact during his second year in north London.\n\nTanguy Ndombele, who left Spurs in June after they agreed to terminate his contract a year early, has joined French side Nice on a contract until 2026.\n\nGray is comfortable playing at right-back too which might impact Royal. Pedro Porro is the first choice in that position but because of his quality on the ball, Gray could quickly establish himself as the next best option and free up Royal to leave.\n\nAs previously reported by The Athletic, Tottenham have admired Conor Gallagher for a long time.\n\nWith the midfielder currently focusing on helping England to reach the final of the Euros, any potential move will have to wait. Other business will depend on who they sell.\n\nRicharlison is attracting interest from the Saudi Pro League and if the Brazilian departs, he would need to be replaced.\n\nSpurs have shipped out several players this summer including Ryan Sessegnon, Joe Rodon and Ndombele. Sergio Reguilon enjoyed a productive six-month loan spell with Brentford but they cannot afford to sign him on a permanent basis. There has been limited interest in Reguilon from elsewhere so far. Tottenham will try to find a new home for Djed Spence too.\n\nThe board have continued to work on the signing of Leny Yoro, which they want to close soon because of the need for centre-backs. There is optimism regarding French club Lille's 18-year-old, which has reached coach Carlo Ancelotti, who currently has only two healthy specialist centre-backs, Antonio Rudiger and Eder Militao, plus midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni, who can play the position too. David Alaba will need a few more months to recover from his serious knee injury.\n\nMadrid have reached an agreement for the sale of Rafa Marin, a 22-year-old centre-back yet to play for their first team who spent last season on loan to fellow La Liga side Alaves.\n\nNapoli of Italy will pay an initial fee of \u20ac11million (\u00a39.3m/$11.9m). If the Naples club pay a further \u20ac10m in the coming months, the buy-back options for Madrid will be \u20ac50m in 2025 and 2026, then \u20ac60m in 2027. If Napoli do not pay that extra \u20ac10m, the buyback options will be \u20ac25m in 2025 and 2026, and \u20ac35m in 2027. The player is in Italy to undergo his medical.\n\nThe Athletic reported Dani Ceballos is keen to leave this summer. The 27-year-old is not happy with his situation, as the board and Ancelotti are aware. Madrid see his departure as complicated, as they still believe in his potential and it is not easy for a club in Spain, where the midfielder wants to continue to play, to pay a transfer fee or assume his high salary.\n\nMadrid have decided they will not sign a midfielder this summer, whatever happens with Ceballos. If he leaves, he will be replaced in the first-team squad by promoting Mario Martin, 20, or 19-year-old Nico Paz from Real Madrid Castilla, the reserve side who play in the Spanish third division.\n\nIn addition to Yoro, there's also Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies. The 23-year-old has reached the Copa America semi-finals with Canada, who will play against Argentina on Tuesday (early Wednesday in the UK). As The Athletic has previously reported, no significant developments are expected during the tournament.\n\nBayern told Davies weeks ago they are willing to keep him for another year and try to renew his contract during the season, despite the risk he could leave for free next summer when his current deal expires. There is still contact between the two clubs, and with the Davies camp.\n\nThere are doubts over the future of Fran Garcia. The Athletic reported Andoni Iraola likes him a lot for his Bournemouth side, although no negotiations are underway. Andriy Lunin's departure is not ruled out, despite a contract renewal until 2029 being agreed months ago. Jesus Vallejo has returned from another loan spell at Granada, his sixth overall and second to that club. The 27-year-old defender would like to stay with his parent club, but Madrid are not counting on him.\n\nMario Cortegana Santos\n\nThe week started with Marc Guiu's departure to Chelsea, who paid \u20ac6million (\u00a35m; $6.5m) for him. Sources close to the player, who will remain anonymous to protect relationships, told The Athletic that since January, Guiu had received offers from many European clubs.\n\nAccording to the source, Guiu did not want to leave Barcelona as he had been at the club for years, but he opted for Chelsea because they could offer him a sporting project he would not have at Barca.\n\nApart from this, the dispute with the two Joaos -- Cancelo and Felix -- continues.\n\nBarcelona, after making a post on their social networks thanking both for their services subsequently deleted the post. Club sources told The Athletic it was a misunderstanding and they still intend to keep them in the team. A post was then uploaded with both dressed in azulgrana to congratulate them on Portugal's passage to the quarter-finals of the Euros.\n\nHansi Flick also finally arrived in Barcelona for the first time since being appointed as head coach in May. On July 5, he landed to set his new project in motion, meet with sporting director Deco, make player requests and talk to players who are recovering in the gym.\n\nAnsu Fati is a sensitive case at the club. He's a young player, who was very exciting four years ago but whose career was cut short by a serious injury.\n\nFati was on loan at Brighton last season and has returned to Barca with the intention of convincing Flick he should stay. They will give him a chance in pre-season but no longer see him as an untouchable player. He could be part of a player exchange package with another club and, if a good offer comes in, Barca would let him go.\n\nBeing a La Masia player, Fati has more credit than other players but both sides are aware that a sale could happen. Some Catalan media reported Sevilla's interest in Fati, but the Andalusian club has denied this to The Athletic.\n\nAs for Raphinha, the club has always seen him as a player to cash in on. He is one of the most marketable players and his natural position -- right-winger -- is occupied by Lamine Yamal. However, his impressive attitude and performances towards the end of the season have changed the opinion of the board and Deco, and the idea is to keep him.\n\nThey see him as a competitive and versatile player who was able to accept Yamal's breakthrough with sportsmanship. However, if an offer of \u20ac60million or more comes in, the club will sell him.\n\nLaporta has reiterated the club is looking for a \"wide\" striker, i.e. a left-winger, and continue to search for a defensive pivot who can make up for the absence of Sergio Busquets.\n\nAs far as left-wingers are concerned, there is still interest in Nico Williams. The player has said he will not think about anything until the end of the Euros. His released clause is in the region of \u20ac55million ($59m; \u00a347m).\n\nLaporta was asked by Catalunya Radio on Monday whether the club could afford such a signing. \"I like Nico a lot,\" he said. \"Here we have to let those who have that responsibility work. Deco is working to make the additions that Hansi Flick has asked for and I hope we get good news.\n\n\"Financially today, we can afford a signing like Nico Williams. We could afford such a signing thanks to the work we have been doing for the last three years\".\n\nThis claim differs from what sources close to other negotiations at the club have said.", "source":

Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko are the most obvious candidates, with the former looking more plausible at present because -- despite his popularity at Arsenal -- the Poland international appears to be generating more interest, particularly from Italy.'\n\nMORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ferdinand rejects 'biased' claim that Man Utd have a better defender than Saliba at Arsenal\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Real Madrid formulate plan to sign 'exceptional' Arsenal star but Gunners have 'no intention' to sell\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Petit reveals Euro 2024 star he's 'heard' Arsenal want as he tells Arteta to sign England star\n\nThe Athletic added in their Transfer DealSheet that Arsenal still have 'significant obstacles' to overcome:\n\n'The Italy international would like to move to the Premier League and is keen to join Arsenal if a deal can be agreed. There are, however, significant obstacles to be overcome: his price is inflated by a good European Championship and a sizeable sell-on fee would be due to his former club Basel.\n\n'There is also the issue of Calafiori's history of serious knee problems.

David Raya was officially unveiled as the Gunners' first summer addition last week with his loan move from Brentford made permanent for \u00a327million.\n\nMikel Arteta and Edu now look to be eyeing defensive reinforcement with Calafiori quite clearly the priority target. An agreement on personal terms has already been reached as talks over a \u00a342million transfer with Bologna continue to progress with the Gunners keen to have the 22-year-old on their pre-season tour of the US, as per the Guardian.\n\nSunday, July 21 looks set to be the day Arteta takes his players overseas which gives Edu just under two weeks to wrap up the Calafiori deal. Having impressed in Serie A and at the European championships, the Italy international was in high demand with Liverpool, Manchester United and Real Madrid all showing an interest.\n\nHowever, once Arsenal officially entered the race, Emirates Stadium became his favoured destination if he was to seal a departure from Bologna. The Italian outfit have been rather relaxed in their exit stance with it clear for some time it would have been impossible to keep hold of Calafiori.\n\nWith that in mind, and Arteta clearly of the belief Arsenal would win the race for his signature, a plan for how to get the best out of him is already in place. While mostly utilised at left centre-back last season, Calafiori is capable of slotting into a back three while also being deployed at left-back, as he did many times at former club Basel.\n\nOn the ball, he is extremely impressive with his assist for Italy's last-gasp goal against Croatia at Euro 2024 proving as such. If deployed at full-back, Calafiori is also capable of inverting into midfield which certainly explains Arteta's desire to bring him in.\n\nREAD MORE: Timber decision, Jorginho role - Dream Arsenal lineup after \u00a342m Riccardo Calafiori transfer\n\nREAD MORE: David Beckham shows true colours with eight-word message to Arsenal star Bukayo Saka\n\nWith Calafiori able to play in so many positions, exits for Oleksandr Zinchenko and Jakub Kiwior could be fast-tracked if a final agreement is reached with Bologna. Zinchenko has been mooted as a potential departee this summer for some time, while interest from Italy in Kiwior is perhaps tempting Arteta into raising further funds.\n\nIf both depart, as Calafiori comes in, Arteta would be left with Ben White, Jurrien Timber, Takehiro Tomiyasu, William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes as his defensive options. Considering the importance of squad depth, it could be worth making another addition at the back or alternatively promoting a youth star, such as Brooke-Norton Cuffy into the senior team.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Riccardo Calafiori (Bologna)\n\nThe player who Arsenal are mainly linked to is Riccardo Calafiori. Arsenal presented their first bid to Bologna early in July, however, their bid was rejected, falling just \u00a32m short (Corriere dello Sport, July 4). However, Mikel Arteta persisted with Riccardo Calafiori and as of July 8, is close to signing him.\n\nIt is believed that Arsenal could complete a deal for Riccardo Calafiori within the next week, having already agreed to personal terms and now, there is just a payment structure to work out with Bologna (Fabrizio Romano, July 8)\n\n2. Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao)\n\nAnother standout player of EURO 2024, it is no surprise that Arsenal are linked with a move for Nico Williams. The Spain winger who currently represents Athletic Bilbao is looking for a move away this summer, with Arsenal one of the interested clubs. However, Williams has revealed his preference, which is to play for FC Barcelona (Sport, July 3).\n\n3. Johan Bakayoko (PSV)\n\nLittle is known about Arsenal's interest in Johan Bakayoko. However, he is certainly on the Arsenal transfer shortlist (Football London, June 30). The Belgian winger is at a point in his career where he could look for the next step, after impressing in the Eredivisie for the last few seasons. His pace and intelligence would be a welcomed boost for Arsenal but he is also linked to Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\n4. Joan Garcia (Espanyol)\n\nAnother position which Mikel Arteta wishes to strengthen in is goalkeeper, with Aaron Ramsdale's uncertain future after EURO 2024. One of the players who he views as an ideal Ramsdale replacement is Joan Garcia of Espanyol, meaning Arsenal could have two Spanish goalkeepers competing between the sticks next season (The Athletic, July 2)", "source": {"uri": "paininthearsenal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pain in the Arsenal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kian_long@paininthearsenal.com", "name": "Kian Long", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_F.C._1909", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bologna F.C. 1909"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD_Espanyol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RCD Espanyol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9_Bakayoko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4306,h_2422,x_0,y_91/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/209/01j2b7fhg30yxtma285z.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716300", "eventUri": "eng-9716300", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1098, "textEnd": 1104}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 1173, "textEnd": 1179, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1813, "textEnd": 1819}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1985, "textEnd": 1992}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 2613, "textEnd": 2619}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

At the time of writing this column, that has yet to happen. But the hope and expectation is that it could happen soon,\" Watts said.\n\n\"Talks are ongoing between the clubs over the final fee and how the deal will be structured. Calafiori is Arsenal's priority when it comes to strengthening their defensive options and so they will push to reach an agreement, but you can never be sure until everything is signed and finalised.\n\n\"It's certainly an interesting move from Arsenal. I have to admit I wasn't expecting the first significant deal of the transfer window to involve a defender. It was always an area that they were looking to strengthen, but I was expecting them to strengthen in the forward areas first. But it does look like an exciting signing.\n\n\"I can't claim to be an expert when it comes to Calafiori, I haven't seen that much of him. But people I've spoken to who have seen lots of him are adamant he has everything needed to be an excellent capture.\"", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_brus@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Mark Brus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_F.C._1909", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bologna F.C. 1909"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bologna-vs-juventus-riccardo-calafiori.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716300", "eventUri": "eng-9716300", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Turin-based outfit had reached an agreement with the Bologna central defender before the Gunners made their interest clear. Mikel Arteta has sold the Arsenal project to Calafiori and ended Juventus' hopes of striking a deal ahead of the new season.\n\nArsenal have caused frustration in Italy after moving into pole position to sign Riccardo Calafiori despite the Bologna star initially being on course to join Serie A rivals Juventus instead of embarking on a fresh challenge at the Emirates Stadium, GIVEMESPORT sources have revealed.\n\nHaving turned David Raya's loan switch from Brentford into a permanent move worth \u00a327million, boss Mikel Arteta has turned his attentions towards bringing in further reinforcements after coming agonisingly close to beating Manchester City to the Premier League title during the 2023/24 campaign.\n\nAlthough William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes have formed a formidable partnership at the heart of Arsenal's backline, with them making 79 appearances alongside each other, sporting director Edu has been involved in negotiations to draft in further competition during the summer transfer window.\n\nGunners Turned Calafiori Away from Juventus Serie A heavyweights frustrated after missing out\n\nJuventus have been left in despair after Arsenal have been able to turn Calafiori's head and move into the driving seat to secure an agreement with Bologna, according to GMS sources, resulting in the Turin-based outfit being forced to focus on attemping to recruit alternative targets as they make preparations for the new season.\n\nThe 22-year-old played a crucial role in his current employers booking their place in the upcoming campaign's Champions League as he racked up seven goal contributions over the course of 30 Serie A appearances last term, resulting in a number of interested parties circling during the early weeks of the transfer window.\n\nGMS sources have been informed that Juventus looked nailed on to pounce as they had an agreement in place with Calafiori, but Arsenal have edged towards winning the race for his signature after deciding to go in search of fresh options to put Gabriel and Saliba under pressure for a regular starting berth.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's statistical averages per 90 minutes during the 2023/24 domestic campaign

Bianconeri had a five-year contract in place for the Italy international, who made three appearances at Euro 2024 before his homeland crashed out at the hands of Switzerland, and were looking to conclude negotiations over a \u00a320million cash-plus-player swap deal with Bologna.\n\nBut respected journalist Ben Jacobs recently told GMS that Arteta has sold the Arsenal project to Calafiori, resulting in the north Londoners overtaking Juventus as the frontrunners to acquire his services, and Bologna are willing to cash in if a bid in the region of \u00a343million is lodged.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Riccardo Calafiori averaged two interceptions per outing at Euro 2024, which was a higher figure than all of his Italy teammates at the tournament\n\nNorth Londoners Took Advantage of Potential Calafiori Bidding War Move to Emirates Stadium initially appeared unlikely\n\nGMS sources have learned that Juventus' hopes of recruiting Calafiori were put on hold when it became clear that attempts had been made to start a bidding war by enticing Premier League big-hitters to head to the negotiating table, leaving the Turin-based outfit increasingly disappointed at how the situation turned.\n\nThiago Motta, who has been appointed as Massimiliano Allegri's successor at the Allianz Stadium on a three-year contract, had been hoping to see the 22-year-old central defender follow in his footsteps by making the switch from Bologna ahead of the fast-approaching 2024/25 campaign getting underway.\n\nRelated Arsenal Will Consider Sales for Three Current Stars\n\nArsenal need to add some players to their ranks and their transfer budget could be boosted by the sales of three stars\n\nBut GMS sources have been told that Arsenal have moved ahead of Juventus in Calafiori's thinking, having made the most of the opportunity to swoop in when his availability became clear during the early stages of the summer transfer window, despite a move to the Emirates Stadium initially appearing unlikely.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of FBref and WhoScored", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Italian defender starred at Euro 2024, despite the Azzurri's early exit, following his fine 2023/24 campaign.\n\nCalafiori was part of the Bologna side that finished fifth in Serie A last season, securing qualification for the Champions League thanks to the expanded competition allowing two fifth-placed sides a spot in the 2024/25 tournament.\n\nBologna had the third-best defensive record in the Italian top flight last season, with Calafiori playing a major role. He played 30 of the 38 Serie A matches, scoring twice and providing five assists.\n\nHis versatility will come in useful, with his ability to play at full-back or in the centre clear for all to see during Italy's short Euro 2024 campaign.\n\nfootball.london understands Arsenal have significant interest in signing Calafiori this summer, with reports of an agreement with the player over personal terms. A \u00a342million deal looks set to be completed, but it could lead to the Gunners needing to offload some players.\n\nArsenal, like other Premier League clubs, are acutely aware of the Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules that they must comply with moving forward.

The Scotsman spent last season on loan with Real Sociedad and was one of the players expected to leave this summer for a transfer fee of around \u00a310million.\n\nHowever, that may now not be the case, with Tierney picking up a hamstring injury in Scotland's second game at Euro 2024 that ruled him out of the rest of the tournament - although that only turned into being one more game for the Scots.\n\nFormer Gunner David Seaman believes that non deal could impact the club's transfer plans moving forward, including the deal to sign Calafiori.\n\nSpeaking to Betway, Seaman said: \"Whether the club need to sell one or two defenders will be on Mikel Arteta's mind now. It's tough to say who might leave - Kieran Tierney is injured again and might be out for a while with a bad hamstring injury.\n\n\"As much as you want to continue buying players, you now have to balance the books with the Profit and Sustainability Rules.\n\n\"Calafiori would be another improvement to the squad. William Saliba and Gabriel don't get replaced in the starting lineup, but if Calafiori comes in it's more competition for places, and depth in case of injury.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He has received interest from all over Europe, namely from several Premier League clubs.\n\nMikel Arteta's side look set to win the race for him, however, and a fee is to be discussed this week. The idea is that Calafiori can join the squad before they set off on their pre-season tour of the USA.\n\nAs with many incomings, outgoings are inevitable. According to The Athletic, Arsenal will likely offload one of their defenders to make room for the Italian, and Kiwior is reportedly the prime candidate, despite his supposed 'popularity' at the club.\n\nThe Polish defender can play either centre-half or left-back - the exact parameters Calafiori would fill were he to sign.\n\nCalafiori would have caught Arsenal's eye at Euro 2024, as he impressed for a poor Italian side who were knocked out by Switzerland in the round of 16. And Kiwior looks set to be replaced by the in-form defender, despite only signing for Arsenal during 2023's January window.\n\nWhen Kiwior was linked with a move away in March, Arteta said: \"We have made it difficult for him for two reasons. One, because he hasn't played that many minutes, and the second one because we asked him to play in a position that he's never played in before.\n\n\"So it's like putting William Saliba as a full-back, and saying, 'There we go, tomorrow go and perform and do what we have to do!' It's all about (adapting to players needs).\n\n\"In the end you can't ask players to do things that they don't feel especially capable of doing in a natural way, so we have to tweak a few things to make sure that the players play to their strengths.\"\n\nAnother player who could be on the chopping block is Oleksandr Zinchenko. Valued at \u00a338million by the Gunners, it is reported that Kiwior remains more likely to be the one who goes due to him gathering more interest than the Ukrainian.\n\nBoth AC Milan and Inter are said to have shown an interest in the Polish defender, whom Arsenal value at \u00a312.5million - a fee that would see them make a near \u00a38million loss on their January signing.\n\nDespite having only spent a season and a half at the Emirates, should Calafiori's move be made official, Kiwior could see himself out of game time and waving goodbye to north London.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

start of pre-season is edging ever closer, now only a couple of weeks away, the transfer rumours have been hotting up for Arsenal.\n\nNaturally, as players drop out of international competitions, deals become easier and moves can be made faster.\n\nAnd it looks like Arsenal's current main target is Italian defender Riccardo Calafiori of Bologna.\n\nReportedly, personal terms have been agreed and now it's between the two clubs to work out a deal, which is rumoured to be north of \u00a340 million.\n\nBologna and Arsenal have a decent relationship after the Takehiro Tomiyasu deal back in 2021.\n\nCalafiori was one of Italy's standout players at the European Championships, notably bursting out of defence into midfield to assist their 98th-minute equaliser against Croatia in the group stage.\n\nThe left-back position was heavily rotated last season and Arteta may be looking for some stability there in Calafiori, who could also cover at centre-back behind Gabriel, especially if Jakub Kiwior were to depart.\n\nJurrien Timber and Tomiyasu are also expected to go into the season fit, giving the Gunners great depth at the back.\n\nIt was also reported this week that Arsenal approached Wolves for goalkeeper Daniel Bentley.\n\nRegardless of the fee or if the deal actually happens, it indicates that Aaron Ramsdale should be off, and Arsenal are on the hunt for a replacement.\n\nBentley himself would be a solid deal, bringing in a keeper with Premier League experience and homegrown status, which counts towards registration rules, for what would presumably be a minimal fee.\n\nMeanwhile, rumours of central midfielders and wingers continue to rumble on, both positions of need based on last season.\n\nHowever, as always, there will be a limit to the incoming business that Arsenal are looking to do until other players are offloaded.\n\nLoan players like Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares are still on the books, all while the Gunners are looking to bring in a new left-back, youth players are also returning and looking to step up, while out-of-favour players still remain at the club on high wages.\n\nWith the European Championships and Copa America coming to a close soon, Mikel Arteta and Edu will have a lot of work to do before the season starts in earnest.", "source": {"uri": "hamhigh.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ham & High"}, "authors": [],

Both clubs are really interested in Calafiori, and now Arsenal have presented their proposal to the Italy international - it's a long-term contract, the salary is not an issue at all, and they also presented their project to the player, and he is open to joining Arsenal in case they can reach an agreement with Bologna.\n\nSo, there is already a green light from Calafiori to Arsenal, but what about Chelsea? My understanding is that Chelsea are prepared to approach Bologna, and that they will try to include players in the negotiation. It's a different strategy, but Chelsea are still there, even if Arsenal are the favourites at the moment.\n\nArsenal have a shortlist with three names in that position - left-footed defenders who can play centre-back or left-back. Jorrel Hato fits the bill in that respect and also remains one of the most appreciated talents by Arsenal, but for now Ajax still insist to keep him for one more season. So, Calafiori is exactly what Arsenal are looking for in that position, and Mikel Arteta has approved the potential deal and we're now waiting for the next step. Let's see what will happen between Arsenal and Bologna, this is now the crucial point.\n\nIt's also important to note that Calafiori has given the green light to Arsenal because Juventus are almost no longer in the race. For weeks and weeks, Juventus wanted Calafiori, they had an agreement on the salary with Calafiori, but they are now considered out as they cannot agree on a deal with Bologna. The truth is that Bologna are furious with Juventus after their manager Thiago Motta made the move there this summer, and so that's why they are furious with Juve and they would prefer to sell the player abroad.\n\nNow they have the chance, because Arsenal are there and Arteta is really keen to bring Calafiori to the club. The relationship between Arsenal and Bologna is also very good after they previously negotiated the deal for Takehiro Tomiyasu, so let's see if Chelsea can come up with something, or if Arsenal will now win the race for one of the most talented young defenders around. Despite rumours about PSG and Bayer Leverkusen, I'm told that the only two clubs in the race are Arsenal and Chelsea, with Arsenal ahead at the moment.\n\nIt will be interesting to see his development from here, and how Arsenal plan to use him if they manage to complete this signing. He can play easily as a centre-back or left-back, he's excellent in both positions; he was a left-back for his whole career before this superb season as centre-back last season.\n\nJoao Palhinha to Bayern Munich is now a 'here we go' as there has been a breakthrough in talks between Bayern and Fulham. Palhinha asked very clearly to be allowed to join Bayern, and now it looks closer to going through, so what could this mean for the future of other Bayern midfielders?\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about Joshua Kimmich in particular as he's in the final year of his contract at Bayern now, and some fans have asked me if Palhinha's arrival means he's replacing him.\n\nLet's see what happens because Bayern have still a chance to extend Kimmich's contract. Still, the most likely scenario at the moment is for Kimmich to leave and try a new experience, it will also depend on proposals because Kimmich will explore all the options available to him after the Euros.\n\nIt's been a quiet summer for Liverpool so far, but we know there was recently interest in Anthony Gordon, and there has been some speculation about a failed attempt at agreeing a swap deal with Newcastle.\n\nSome outlets have reported that Joe Gomez was one of the names being offered by Liverpool to Newcastle, but I can't confirm this. Newcastle and Liverpool had a contact for Gordon, as reported a few days ago, but a swap deal was never something close or concrete, so I don't have this information I'm afraid.\n\nIn terms of names coming in for the defence, Marc Guehi has been linked with Liverpool (as well as other clubs) several times and he's impressing with England at the Euros. There is interest from many clubs, but nothing close or concrete yet as he wants to focus on the tournament now and not be distracted. For sure Guehi remains an interesting name for this summer with two years left on his contract at Crystal Palace.\n\nThere is a lot of movement in Saudi Arabia - the market there has restarted and we're heading into important days. Al Ittihad also have a new manager in Stefano Pioli, and something could happen from the Premier League in the next days.\n\nOne concrete possibility is for Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson to move to Saudi - it remains the case that he has proposals from Saudi clubs, as I reported at the end of May. There are discussions ongoing between Al Nassr and the agents of Ederson, though they're not the only ones showing an interest. Ederson is open to a move to Saudi, and Man City are open to letting him go.\n\nNow City are waiting for an official bid from Ederson, and of course a move will depend on the financial proposal. Still, City have been aware of this possibility since May and so they extended the contract of Stefan Ortega, because if Ederson leaves, Ortega will be the new first-choice goalkeeper for Pep Guardiola and City will bring in a new backup for that position.\n\nReal Madrid have had a busy few months and they have two more big names on their list at the moment - Alphonso Davies at Bayern, and Leny Yoro of Lille. So what's the latest with these players?\n\nReal Madrid remain very keen on Davies and never stopped contacts on the player side. However, it depends on the asking price, because if Bayern put Davies on the market for a normal fee, Real Madrid are happy to start a negotiation, otherwise they are very happy with the squad they have.\n\nIf Davies were then to stay at Bayern but not sign a new contract, then the chances for Real Madrid to move for the Canadian left-back next summer as a free agent would be very concrete. So it could either be Davies now for a reasonable price, or Davies in 2025 if he doesn't extend his contract at Bayern.\n\nWith Yoro, the situation remains quite clear - Real Madrid want the player, and the player wants to go to Real Madrid. The message to the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain has always been clear - his desire is to go to Real Madrid, so he is pushing to go there and he is ready to wait for them.\n\nReal Madrid don't want to pay big money for a player who's out of contract next summer, so it's a similar situation as with Alphonso Davies, it would also in this case need to be a fair price. Still, there is the feeling that Lille would be ready to sell the player this summer, and this is why it remains a very strong topic for this summer, with contacts taking place.\n\nFor now, the only way for clubs like Man United, Liverpool and PSG to enter strongly into the race is if negotiations between Lille and Real Madrid collapse. In that case, Yoro could open the door to other clubs, but for now Real Madrid is his absolute priority.\n\nThere has been an interesting story coming out about PSG being interested in Leeds United winger Crysencio Summerville. I've spoken before about the expectation being for Summerville to leave Leeds after they couldn't win promotion back to the Premier League, and I've also reported on Summerville to Brighton being discussed, so what about these new links with PSG?\n\nMy understanding is that the situation is: Summerville shares the same agents as Feyenoord defender Lutsharel Geertruida. PSG are in talks with Geertruida on personal terms, so Summerville was mentioned during talks but there's still no negotiation ongoing between the clubs or the player's agents. It's an open race with Brighton and more clubs interested.", "source": {"uri": "kmaupdates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kmaupdates.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With the summer transfer window in full swing, the focus is on two key players: Jakub Kiwior and Riccardo Calafiori. This piece delves into the implications of these potential moves, the strategy behind them, and the financial considerations at play.\n\nThe Gunners are reportedly close to securing a deal with Riccardo Calafiori, the young breakout star from Euro 2024, who could soon swap Bologna for North London. Calafiori's signing, discussed in detail by TeamTalk, would not only bolster Arsenal's defensive options but also usher in fresh tactical possibilities for Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nAs negotiations enter the final stages, Arsenal's sporting director Edu is yet to match Bologna's asking price of \u20ac50 million (\u00a342m), though they are reportedly very close to clinching a deal. Calafiori's versatility as a left-sided centre-half or left-back makes him a valuable asset, potentially at the expense of current squad member Jakub Kiwior.\n\nJakub Kiwior, who shares similar playing positions to Calafiori, faces an uncertain future at the Emirates. Despite being a 'popular' member of the squad and having earned Arteta's trust, Kiwior's game time could diminish significantly upon Calafiori's arrival.\n\nThis has led to discussions about a possible move for Kiwior, with Arsenal reportedly open to 'good proposals'. Inter Milan is currently the frontrunner, which would see Kiwior return to Italy, where he previously played for Spezia.\n\nThe financial aspect of these moves cannot be overstated. Arsenal, known for being conservative sellers, faces scrutiny over the potential underpricing of Kiwior. The suggestion that Arsenal could sell their \u00a320m signing for just \u00a312.5m has been widely criticized as undervaluing a talented defender.\n\nCharles Watts, an Arsenal insider, emphasised the need for Arsenal to secure a fair price for Kiwior, given the investment and his development at the club. This highlights a broader strategy for Arsenal: to ensure financial prudence while making tactical adjustments to the squad.\n\nBeyond Kiwior and Calafiori, Arsenal is also reportedly eyeing another Euro 2024 star, Ferdi Kadioglu. His addition could further strengthen Arsenal's left-back position, showcasing a clear strategy to solidify defensive capabilities while rejuvenating the squad with young, dynamic talent. However, they face competition from Manchester United for Kadioglu, adding another layer of complexity to their transfer endeavours.\n\nAs Arsenal navigates this pivotal transfer window, the decisions made will have long-lasting implications on the team's structure and performance. The potential acquisition of Calafiori and the associated departure of Kiwior underscore a period of strategic realignment under Arteta's stewardship. Arsenal's ability to negotiate these transitions effectively will be critical in shaping their competitive edge in the upcoming season.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Kiwior", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jakub Kiwior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edu_(footballer,_born_1978)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edu (footballer, born 1978)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezia_Calcio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spezia Calcio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/k6mK8YrBRsoADGg3Ea6Ymw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/epl_index_articles_253/ff54570b1756a2049ef0a84fb2449cc9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716300", "eventUri": "eng-9716300", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

A unique defensive profile dripping in versatility and ball-playing swagger, Calafiori would be a considerable upgrade on the likes of Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko.\n\nHowever, if there's something that should concern the club as they prepare to spend close to \u20ac50m on the Italian's services, it's his injury history. Calafiori has been free from setbacks for quite some time, but an awful injury sustained in 2018 may well have long-term ramifications.\n\nCalafiori's injury concerns stem from the devastating setback he suffered during a UEFA Youth League contest while playing for AS Roma against Viktoria Plzen in October 2018.\n\nThe then 16-year-old's knee injury was so bad that it was described as 'career-threatening'. During the latter stages of the contest, an ugly over-the-top challenge from Plzen's Vaclav Svoboda forced Calafiori into a heap. His knee buckled, and it was later revealed that the teenager had torn all the ligaments in his left knee, as well as his meniscus.\n\n\"There is the most important battle of my life ahead of me, and I certainly cannot back down. The time has come to put aside the boy, the, at times, little boy that I have been until now, and become a MAN,\" the Italian later wrote on Instagram.\n\nThere were fears that Calafiori had re-torn his ACL in a Primavera match against Lazio in November 2019, just a few months after he'd returned from the initial setback. However, the defender avoided a major issue and spent just over a month out.\n\nHowever, given the nature of his knee injury, Calafiori remains susceptible to hamstring issues. He suffered his first notable problem in January 2021 and the first-half of this year was plagued by a hamstring woes.\n\nBetween January and May that year, at a time when he was attempting to break into Paulo Fonseca's starting XI, the Italian missed over 20 games thanks to three separate hamstring injuries.\n\nMuscle injury - November 2021\n\nThere remains some ambiguity surrounding the issue Calafiori sustained in November 2021. The FIGC say that the defender was absent from Italy U21 duty that month after picking up a 'knock', while transfermarkt.com suggest Calafiori was once again struggling with a muscular problem.\n\nThe last notable injury of Calafiori's young career to date arrived almost two years ago at the start of his year-long spell with Basel.\n\nJose Mourinho was seemingly never convinced by the injury-plagued defender, with Roma parting ways with the defender for a meagre fee in the summer of 2022. However, their decision initially seemed to have been vindicated when Calafiori suffered another muscle issue in November 2022.\n\nTransfermarkt describes his latest notable setback as a 'torn muscle fiber' that saw him miss over a month of action.", "source": {"uri": "paininthearsenal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pain in the Arsenal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_cormack@paininthearsenal.com", "name": "James Cormack", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Kiwior", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakub Kiwior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_F.C._1909", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bologna F.C. 1909"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Zinchenko_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Zinchenko (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Youth_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Youth League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Viktoria_Plze\u0148", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Viktoria Plze\u0148"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

They are likely to propose a season-long loan with an option to buy during the summer of 2025.\n\nJuventus are also admirers of the 24-year-old, but Mikel Arteta's side could utilise him to their advantage to get the Calafiori deal over the line with Bologna.\n\nThe Gunners were pro-active in the transfer market last summer. They signed Jurrien Timber, Kai Havertz and Declan Rice before the pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nArsenal are set to embark on the same trip in 10 days' time, but they are yet to make any signing. Calafiori has been tipped to join, but the club have not agreed payment terms.\n\nIn our view, they must speed up their transfer activity in the near future. Bologna are unlikely to provide a discount on Calafiori, considering 40 percent of the profit will go to Basel.\n\nHowever, the Gunners could do immediate business with them by negotiating a deal for Kiwior. A good loan fee with a buy clause could smoothen the negotiations for Calafiori.\n\nAside from a versatile defender, Arsenal have been tipped to sign a new midfielder, striker and a goalkeeper.

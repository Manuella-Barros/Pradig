However, those expectations are not without merit, particularly when it relates to North Carolina head coach Mack Brown, who gave a glowing review of Maye to the Patriots.\n\nBrown has been around the game of football for decades and has seen it all. He most recently led the Tar Heels to an 8-5 record and their fifth straight bowl game appearance. He has seen solid quarterback play at the collegiate level, dating back to Vince Young during his Texas days.\n\nBrown got the chance to see Maye up close, and the No. 3 overall pick of the 2024 NFL draft was one of the best quarterbacks in North Carolina program history, throwing for 400 yards in three separate games in the 2023 season alone.\n\nNow, New England hopes to unlock that same potential in their effort to rebuild on the offensive side of the ball. Brown is confident about what Maye brings to the table.\n\n\"I've learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting, so I'm very honest with the NFL coaches,\" Brown said, via NESN.com's Sean T. McGuire. \"This is important to them.\n\n\"So with Coach Mayo, I knew this is huge for him, just starting out in this first year.

And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.'\"\n\nThe jury is still out on whether Maye will be able to live up to his draft stock at the NFL level.

During that trip, Mayo and company got to speak with longtime and well-respected college coach Mack Brown. Mayo, specifically, said he received a \"glowing recommendation\" from the Tar Heels head coach and noted how that conversation eased any nerves about drafting Maye.\n\nWhile meeting with a handful of New England reporters on a conference call Monday, Brown shared what he told Mayo and the Patriots.\n\n\"I've learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting, so I'm very honest with the NFL coaches,\" Brown said. \"This is important to them.\n\n\"So with Coach Mayo, I knew this is huge for him, just starting out in this first year.

Brown praised Maye for his toughness, competitiveness and ability to lead a rocker room with his mix of positive reinforment and constructive criticism.\n\nBrown even spoke to the Maye athletic and authentic family, along with the quarterback's longtime girlfriend. Maye introduced his three brothers and girlfriend to reporters during his introductory press conference at Gillette Stadium.\n\n\"He's an unbelievable person,\" Brown said. \"He's one of the nicest, toughest, most competitive, young people I've ever been around. I've said often I would adopt him. He's that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny, but it's true.\"\n\nBrown also relayed a story as to how Maye included other position groups whenever he was approached with an NIL deal. It was one of the many ways Maye proved his worth as a teammate.\n\n\"So if they came and said, 'We want you to do this advertisement.' He said, 'Well, the offensive linemen need to be with me, and they need to be paid.' Or, 'Well, we want you to get fed through the seafood company for the year.' And he said, 'That's great, the receivers and their families need to get fed, too.'\"\n\nBut Brown made it clear to New England's organization the competitor they were getting, too.\n\n\"He is not coming to Boston to lose,\" Brown said.\n\nIt seems that message was heard loud and clear throughout the Patriots organization.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_t_mcguire@nesn.com", "name": "Sean T.

While there were two highly-touted quarterbacks taken before, the Patriots had a wide selection of talent, but ended up picking the University of North Carolina product as executive Eliot Wolf explains the decision.\n\nWolf has been the \"de facto\" general manger for the Patriots after the team parted ways with Bill Belichick and was at the forefront of a selection that could start a new era with a bang. He was on \"The Adam Schefter Podcast\" and said that it was a mixture of. the \"talent\" and \"person\" that made New England fall in love with Maye.\n\n\"The talent and the person,\" Wolf said via Tim Crowley of NESN.com. \"He's a great person, he's tough, he's gritty, he was productive. He elevated those around him. He's 6-foot-4 1/2 and 225 pounds. He can really throw the ball. He's athletic. I think it's a combination of those things. We think there's a lot to develop with him whenever that time may be.\"\n\nMaye played in three seasons for the Tar Heels where the last two showed truly why the 21-year old has the ability to be a starting quarterback for the future. Last season, he threw for 3,608 yards, 24 touchdowns, and nine interceptions, which were down from the year before where he passed over 4,000 yards, 38 touchdowns, and seven picks.\n\n\"His character and his passion for football. His drive. He's an all-around good person, he's really tough, he's all football,\" Wolf continued about his new quarterback. \"He comes from a good family. I could go on and on about this guy. Those things will move forward with us. He's a younger person. As he assimilates into our locker room, I think our players will rally around him.\"\n\nIn another timeline, the Patriots might not have had Maye on their roster as there were reportedly multiple teams that wanted to trade into the No. 3 pick and take the Tar Heel themselves or another player they loved. Wolf would confirm that notion and even said they were \"listening,\" but the decision to stay put was simple for them as they did not want to pass up on Maye.\n\n\"We were listening throughout the process,\" Wolf said. \"We weren't stringing these teams along. The opportunity to pick Drake superseded anything that anyone offered.\"\n\nNow that he's on the roster, he will be be competing for the starting job against veteran Jacoby Brissett. When Maye spoke about the opportunity being with the Patriots, he mentioned that \"being detailed\" will be his main goal heading into camp according to Khari Thompson of Boston.com.\n\n\"The biggest thing is being detailed with coach Van Pelt's offense, knowing all the details first,\" Maye said. \"I think going out there like a deer in the headlights as a rookie is not smart. So, really fine-tuning that and really studying it, getting to know it, and being able to teach it back to somebody.\"\n\n\"That's kind of how I learn things,\" Maye continued. \"Being able to teach it back to somebody is when I really feel like you know it. So, grind that, get really detailed in the playbook, all the motions, all the little stuff.\"\n\nThere's no doubt that Maye will have to fill in the massive void left by Tom Brady who led New England to six Super Bowls before finishing out his playing career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. While Mac Jones couldn't do it, the organization is hoping Maye could be the one to bring them back to a positive state after a string of bad seasons as the 21-year old said that his timing will be crucial to get down in his first season.\n\n\"I think that's a big thing in the NFL, using cadence as a weapon and just starting from there,\" Maye said. \"Just being under center. You go under center a lot in the redzone during college but like you said not as much in the open field, so getting used to that. I feel like my game translates pretty well to the NFL, so I'm looking forward to that and looking forward to just getting with the guys, getting out there, and getting going.\"\n\nA big football name that has got to see Maye play first hand is Clyde Christensen who is an offensive analyst for the University of North Carolina and also coached stellar signal-callers like Brady and Peyton Manning in the past. He said that while the footwork definitely needs work, people are going to see a \"big jump in his game.\"\n\n\"The footwork's a little bit rogue, but he'll reel that in,\" Christensen said. \"I think that getting into the pro system, and just doing it full-time without any other distractions, that you'll see a big jump in his game, just in his footwork and some of the things people have been critical of, which probably I don't agree with.\"\n\nBesides the football aspect in leading a historic franchise like the Patriots back to the promised land, he's also \"excited for a new beginning.\" He would express how he has been in North Carolina for his \"whole life\" so he's elated to join a city that has other big-time teams like the Celtics in basketball and the Bruins in hockey.\n\n\"I'm just excited for a new beginning,\" Maye said. \"I've been in North Carolina for my whole life. I'm excited to get somewhere new. It's a great sports town up there, and I know they've got a lot going on right now with the Bruins and Celtics. So, excited to join that and get things going.\"\n\nNew England fans are hoping that Maye and the new coaching staff can improve after a 4-13 record where they finished last in the AFC East.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_weinberger@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Zachary Weinberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Tar Heels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Christensen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clyde Christensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/All-the-reasons-New-England-drafted-Drake-Maye-No.-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

While many point to Maye's unreal talent as the reason he'll succeed in the NFL, his former head coach believes it has more to do with the head on the QB's shoulders.\n\nMaye got to learn under North Carolina head football coach Mack Brown for the last two years, and Brown sounds even more impressed with Maye the person than he is with Maye the quarterback. Given that Maye is a pretty talented quarterback, that says a lot about the 21-year-old's character.\n\n\"There has never been a better person, number one,\" Brown said of Maye in a chat with WBZ-TV's Dan Roche. \"Tremendous student, he has a wonderful family, and so much integrity. He's been dating the same girl since the seventh grade.\"\n\nBrown says that the Patriots and New England fans are getting an extremely high-character and an incredibly driven player in Maye, one he believes can return the Patriots franchise to its glory days.\n\nIt may take a few years, but Brown believes that Maye will eventually bring a Lombardi Trophy of his own to Foxboro.\n\n\"Patriots fans, regardless of what happens in the early years, this guy is a guy who can take you back to a Super Bowl,\" said Brown. \"Which is what you all are used to and what you expect. Just support him. You can't do better; he's the best.\n\n\"You don't even know how lucky you are, but great times are ahead,\" added Brown.\n\nMaye comes from a family of competitive athletes, and that upbringing has instilled a desire to win deep inside the quarterback. Maye's father, Mark, was a star quarterback at UNC, and two of his three older brothers won championships in college.\n\nThat's something that Maye is reminded about almost daily, and has lit a fire inside the quarterback.\n\n\"So he has that obsession to get a ring. He is really competitive,\" said Brown. \"He's very polite and will give you the 'Aww shucks' and 'Thank you all so much' and then will go and try to beat you down. ... Whether it's Ping-Pong or pickleball, he is going to fight to win.\n\n\"His dream now will be to win a Super Bowl,\" added Brown. \"He has a chip on his shoulder. When he wins a Super Bowl, he's going to walk around holding that thing out so his brothers can see.\"\n\nMaye's upside is through the roof, but many wondered how long it will take him to reach his ceiling at the next level. Brown once again reiterated that Maye has everything it takes to win a Super Bowl in the NFL, and said that he's coming from an NFL-style offense at North Carolina.\n\n\"The height, the length, the athletic ability, the accurate throws. He is also a game manager and is really smart,\" said Brown. \"He is going to make really good decisions and he is fun to watch. The fans will watch him compete so hard and they will pull for him.\"\n\nBrown added that his senior advisor at UNC, Clyde Christensen, has coached quarterbacks like Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, and most recently, Tom Brady in Tampa Bay, during his career as a QBs coach in the NFL. Maye also had former Cleveland Browns head coach Freddie Kitchens on the UNC staff as the team's run game coordinator and tight ends coach.\n\n\"I think because he's been around all these NFL coaches, I don't think [it will take him long,]\" said Brown. \"Him and Sam Howell would sit and watch NFL video for hours and try to stay ahead of the game. We were running last year an offense that is an NFL offense. I think he'll be ready to go.\"\n\nBrown pointed out that guys like Troy Aikman and Peyton Manning struggled early in their careers but didn't need much time to turn into great quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\n\"I'm so excited for [Drake] and the city of Boston, because it's the perfect fit,\" said Brown.\n\nWhile he is eager to get a ring of his own to rub it in his older brothers' faces, Maye is also a compassionate fella.\n\n\"I think his upside on the football field is so good. When he walks into the room he has that it factor that everyone stops and turns. Everyone wants to meet him and be around him, part of his life. He's the same way in the locker room,\" said Brown.\n\nBrown said that was evident throughout his two seasons with the Tar Heels when Maye would turn down NIL offers that didn't include his teammates.\n\n\"He would never take a deal or an opportunity with a company without making sure other players would be involved. If someone came in and said they wanted him to do an ad, he wouldn't do it without his offensive line involved. That's who he is,\" said Brown. \"He competes but team is first. The fans all love him and they'll love his reaction.\"\n\nAs with any rookie quarterback, there are going to be bumps along the way. There will be bad throws, poor decisions, incorrect reads -- everything you'd expect out of a rookie in the NFL.\n\nFans and the media will get on Maye, but Brown says the quarterback is his own biggest critic.\n\n\"He is really, really hard on himself. All of us are at a high level,\" noted Brown. \"But he is improving in that area because we've told him he has to let that go and move on. But if he throws three touchdowns and there is a tipped ball that is intercepted, he's going to beat himself up for that tipped ball.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Maye is from North Carolina and has an incredible amount of raw talent.\n\nHowever, the former college quarterback is not the only addition to the room for 2024. The Patriots signed former Washington Commanders quarterback Jacoby Brissett to a one-year deal to serve as a possible bridge starter to Maye.\n\nRelated: New England Patriots facing big hurdle in GM search\n\nDespite the thought process that Brissett will start Week 1 and Maye will sit, that is not an overwhelming sentiment within New England.\n\nAccording to the Boston Herald's Andrew Callahan, some people in the Patriots organization believe Maye could win the starting quarterback job over Brissett throughout the offseason and preseason. Many believed Maye seemed likely to sit behind Brissett.\n\nNew England head coach Jerod Mayo wouldn't commit to Brissett or Maye as the starting quarterback in the moments following the NFL Draft. However, Maye needs a lot of development in terms of footwork, accuracy, and other mechanics before stepping on the field.\n\nRelated: 10 worst New England Patriots teams ever\n\nThat is one reason the Patriots hired offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, who specializes in footwork and working with quarterbacks. Brissett could start while Van Pelt, quarterback coach T.C. McCartney, and senior offensive assistant Ben McAdoo work with Maye.\n\nThe Patriots must protect its potential franchise quarterback by not rushing his development. In 2021, it was unclear if newly drafted quarterback Mac Jones would start over Cam Newton, but his performance in training camp made him the starter.\n\nJones had a phenomenal rookie season, but it all went downhill when Belichick brought in Matt Patricia and Joe Judge to replace Josh McDaniels. Then, the former Alabama quarterback had Bill O'Brien as his third offensive coordinator in three years.\n\nRelated: NFL power rankings 2024, see where New England Patriots land\n\nNew England eventually traded Jones to the Jaguars and wasted its first-round pick in 2021. Therefore, the Patriots just went through the process of restarting at quarterback. It's essential to ensure Maye is in the right situation, whether it relates to coaching or the supporting cast around him.\n\nMaye has all of the physical tools and raw talent to become a franchise quarterback in the NFL. It's unclear whether that journey as a starter will begin in Week 1 of his rookie year, the middle of the season, or Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nWhile some members of the Patriots believe he could win the job, the evaluation should be much more than Maye v. Brissett. If the offensive cast isn't up to par and the line is struggling to block, it makes little sense to potentially ruin its quarterback's future.\n\nMaye will eventually get his chance as the Patriots' starting quarterback, but when that occurs will be the biggest story throughout the offseason.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_konenski@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Austin Konenski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_McAdoo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben McAdoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Judge_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Judge (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Patricia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Patricia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O'Brien_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill O'Brien (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NFL-New-England-Patriots-Drake-Maye-Press-Conference-23120754.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Since Tom Brady's departure, the Patriots have struggled to fill the void, as the plan was for the No. 3 overall pick to be the next face of the franchise.\n\nNew England did their due diligence on the handful of top-tier quarterbacks available on the draft board, as two were selected before they even were on the clock. However, their guy was still there, as they brought former UNC football star Drake Maye to Foxboro.\n\nAccording to Sean McGuire from NESN, the Patriots met with Maye on numerous occasions during the draft process, including during his pro day in Chapel Hill. Mayo also had the opportunity to speak to his head coach, Mack Brown, who, of course, gave a glowing recommendation for his former quarterback.\n\nWhen speaking to media members in New England via video conference, Brown admitted what he told Mayo during their discussions:\n\n\"I've learned that I want the high school coach to tell me the truth in recruiting, so I'm very honest with the NFL coaches. This is important to them.\n\nSo with Coach Mayo, I knew this is huge for him, just starting out in this first year. So I just told him, 'If I was the coach of the Patriots, I would want Drake Maye. We all put our checks in the mouth of players, and that's what you're (Mayo) gonna do. And I would rather have Drake Maye than anybody in the country leading my football team.'\n\nSure, his film speaks for itself, but Brown is one of the best people to advocate for everything else Maye brings to the table. A fierce competitor and a tremendous leader, Maye is the type of quarterback you want leading your franchise, as Brown made sure he let NFL teams know that they would be getting a very special player and person by selecting him.\n\nWhat Brown said was more than enough to convince the Patriots, who now look to build another dynasty with Maye under-center.", "source": {"uri": "keepingitheel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Keeping It Heel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mack Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5797,h_3260,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/206/01hxa8p4bdsac7e8ge3k.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

They knew Caleb Williams was going No. 1 overall, and they rightly assumed the Commanders would be selecting Jayden Daniels.\n\nA convincing offer was never made, and in the days preceding the first round of the draft, sources had told the Herald that they couldn't envision a trade coming together by the time it was their time to pick. The Patriots had so much confidence that such an offer -- \"a bag,\" as head coach Jerod Mayo once called it -- wasn't coming at the last minute that they called Maye, who was on-site at the draft in Detroit, as soon as they were on the clock.\n\nSo, when did Maye first hit the Patriots' radar? And what made Wolf, Mayo and Co. so comfortable in taking Maye to be their future franchise quarterback?\n\nThe North Carolina native and four-star recruit immediately vaulted up future draft rankings as UNC's starting quarterback in 2022, leading the Tar Heels to the ACC Championship Game and earning ACC Player of the Year honors, completing 66.2% of his passes for 4,321 yards with 38 touchdowns, seven interceptions and seven more rushing scores.\n\nBut scouts and executives first got an on-field look at him at UNC's Pro Day, when he was throwing to Colts 2023 third-round pick Josh Downs.\n\n\"The ball never hit the ground,\" a source, who compared it to C.J. Stroud's performance throwing to Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave at Ohio State's pro day in 2022, recalled.\n\nThe Patriots never stopped scouting quarterbacks, even after selecting Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. They met with eventual Colts first-round pick Anthony Richardson at the 2023 combine but ultimately decided against trading up for a quarterback, instead choosing to trade down to select Oregon cornerback Christian Gonzalez, a home-run pick who excelled before suffering a season-ending injury early in the year.\n\nBut after a second straight year of lackluster play from Jones that eventually led to his trade to the Jaguars, the Patriots knew they were in business for a quarterback in the 2024 draft.\n\nSources at the combine indicated the Patriots would be comfortable selecting any of the top three quarterbacks -- Maye, USC's Williams or LSU's Daniels -- in the draft, and Mayo reiterated that after the first round. They never strayed.\n\n\"Those top three guys, we were comfortable with all three of those guys, and it just happened to be Drake,\" Mayo said.\n\nThe team met with Maye, Williams and Daniels, plus Michigan's J.J. McCarthy and Oregon's Bo Nix, at the combine, and their interest in Maye was only piqued, even after his production and efficiency dropped off in 2023, when he completed 63.3% of his passes for 3,608 yards with 24 touchdowns and nine interceptions with nine rushing scores.\n\nA Patriots source explained away the decline by citing the new offense, scheme, offensive line and receivers that Maye was working with.\n\n\"Everything was new, and there will be growing pains,\" the source said. \"I think it's as easy as that. I don't think it was him. I think he was trying to do everything the way he was being coached to do it, because he's that kind of guy.\"\n\nThe Patriots went on to meet with Maye at his Pro Day in March and again on a pre-draft visit at Gillette Stadium.\n\nEvery time the Patriots met with their future quarterback, they became more comfortable with the idea. Coaches, including Mayo, raved about his formal meeting at the combine.\n\nAt his pro day at UNC, they were impressed by his recall. Maye remembered everyone in the room and what they had discussed. He was able to correlate what he had operated in UNC's offense with what the Patriots are planning to run in offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt's new system. The scheme and verbiage were easy for Maye to grasp, and he came across as smart, engaging and personable to his eventual team.\n\nAnd he threw well.\n\nMaye was nitpicked after two of his first seven throws sailed over his receivers' heads. But after he settled into a rhythm, the Patriots were impressed, especially with his ball placement. He wasn't just throwing to open receivers. He was placing the ball as if a defense was present on the field.\n\nEveryone in the building \"got really comfortable\" with taking Maye after his visit, when he proved what he had retained at his previous two meetings, according to a source. They believed he was a competitor, and they liked his makeup.\n\n\"A lot of the times that offense was on him, and he was the one carrying it,\" a source said. \"He's really good, and he's wired the right way.\"\n\nThey knew how good of an athlete he was. Maye led Myers Park High School basketball in points and rebounds as a senior. Two of his teammates went on to play Division 1 basketball. He was playing over other future Division 1 hoopers.\n\nThe Patriots also attended pro days for Williams, Daniels, McCarthy, Nix and Washington's Michael Penix. They hosted Daniels, McCarthy and Penix on \"30 visits\" and felt like they had learned enough about Nix from their time at the combine and his pro day to take him if it became a reality. League executives at the NFL annual meeting in March believed it was a foregone conclusion that the Patriots would stay put to take a quarterback.\n\nThere were reports of interest from the Patriots in a trade down in the days leading up to the draft, but the team had a good idea that they were staying put. The Giants were willing to part with a future first-round pick to move up from No. 6 overall. The Vikings even wanted the Patriots to give up picks in their package that included the Nos. 11 and 23 overall picks plus a future first-rounder. Those offers would not get them to budge.\n\nOne source considered one of the remaining quarterbacks to be worthy of a late first-round pick and another as a second-rounder. The next three quarterbacks went off the board eighth, 10th and 12th overall. It didn't make sense for the Patriots to trade down only to overdraft a lesser quarterback.\n\nUltimately, the Patriots don't currently view next year's quarterback class to be as good as this year's, which is why six QBs came off the board in the first 12 picks. If the Patriots had traded back, they would have acquired a future first that would likely have to be packaged to trade up for a quarterback, an exercise that one source viewed as pointless, especially since there's no guarantee that a player as good as Maye would be available in 2025. And the Patriots' hope is that they're never drafting as high as third overall again.\n\nPatriots training camp will have a different look this summer.\n\nFor the first time in five years, Patriots quarterbacks will be dropping back and firing fastballs at their intended targets. It's going to be night and day from the quarterback competitions in the immediate post-Tom Brady era with rookies Drake Maye and Joe Milton and free-agent addition Jacoby Brissett under center.\n\nBut Maye wasn't trusted as the Patriots' future franchise quarterback solely because of his big arm. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound passer impressed his new team every step of the way from his command of a room, to his memory and associative skills.\n\nMaye will have a chance to earn a starting role, competing with Brissett, in training camp when the quarterback play will hardly resemble what was on the field when Jones and Bailey Zappe were dueling it out. After picking Maye, Wolf said that the team planned to continue adding weapons on offense and shore up the offensive line. They went on to select wide receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker in the second and fourth rounds, respectively, offensive tackle Caedan Wallace in the third round and guard Layden Robinson in the fourth round.\n\nTheir only \"splash\" free-agent moves came in the form of re-signings, but the hope is that Polk and Baker can contribute sooner than rookie Patriots receivers of the past, and that Wallace and Okorafor will battle it out for the starting left tackle role. There's confidence in the new coaching staff to put out a better offensive product.\n\nAnd it's not out of the realm of possibility that Maye could be the Day 1 starter. But in order for that to become reality, Maye will need to continue to earn the team's trust. And he can do that by showing off his big arm, ball placement, athleticism, command of a room and ability to absorb and carry Van Pelt's offense.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news",

This will see Maye join his fellow quarterbacks in throwing practice with their receivers.\n\nBrissett may get the initial decision to start, the veteran's experience would give Maye time to acclimatise to the offense and the NFL.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nDrake Maye is hoping to be the future of the Patriots franchise, as he'll compete with Jacoby Brissett for the starting role\n\nThe Patriots have also brought on board former Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt as their playcaller - a familiar face for Brissett from the 2022 season. With an impressive 53-25 touchdown-to-interception ratio under his belt, Brissett could be the day one starter despite Maye being an early pick in the class.\n\nWhile Maye is seen as the future of the franchise, some suggest it might be wise for the 21 year old to sit out his rookie season - much like Patrick Mahomes did in his first year with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nMeanwhile, sixth-round quarterback Milton will be vying with Zappe for the third-string role. It's rare for NFL teams to carry four quarterbacks on their roster, so Milton will get his chance to shine in the upcoming OTA's, likely playing a significant role in the preseason games in August.",

He was asked during a recent episode of 98.5 The Sports Hub's Zolak and Bertrand what areas he needs to improve on the most.\n\n\"The biggest thing is being detailed with coach Van Pelt's offense, knowing all the details first,\" Maye said. \"I think going out there like a deer in the headlights as a rookie is not smart. So, really fine-tuning that and really studying it, getting to know it, and being able to teach it back to somebody.\n\n\"That's kind of how I learn things,\" Maye added. \"Being able to teach it back to somebody is when I really feel like you know it. So, grind that, get really detailed in the playbook, all the motions, all the little stuff.\"\n\nMaye also said working on his timing will be important as he transitions to pro football.\n\n\"I think that's a big thing in the NFL, using cadence as a weapon and just starting from there,\" Maye said. \"Just being under center. You go under center a lot in the redzone during college but like you said not as much in the open field, so getting used to that.

He is a well-respected veteran the team believes can both mentor a young rookie and win games, despite their lack of weaponry and proven pass protectors.\n\nDespite these circumstances, some at team headquarters believe Maye could win the job outright. Maye's path to playing time will run parallel to Brissett's; a two-man race where the gun goes off this spring and both quarterbacks sprint through the summer heat.\n\nThere is a blueprint for Maye to pull ahead of Brissett and start the season opener. Three years ago, well before his career fell apart in New England, Mac Jones beat out Cam Newton with a performance that clearly established he was the best passer in camp. If history repeats itself, Maye will have established himself in a few key areas.\n\nAllow Devin McCourty and James White, former captains who witnessed Jones' rookie rise that year, to explain.\n\nOn your marks, get set, study.\n\nBefore Maye can win on the field, he has to triumph in the classroom. He must master the Patriots' new pass concepts, reads and protections, their run plays and route adjustments, and demonstrate all of this understanding in practice and games. Maye's grasp of the playbook need not be perfect, but it should be close.\n\nBecause talent alone can't foster the trust a rookie quarterback needs to win over teammates and coaches. Only knowing where to be and what to do, snap after snap after snap, can do that.\n\n\"You can throw the ball 80 yards and make every possible throw, but if you don't know when to make the throw or how to read the coverage, who cares?\" White said. \"The mental part of the quarterback position is more important than anything.\"\n\nNFL notes: The Patriots' rebuild about to enter its next phase\n\nJones proved this in 2021, particularly during joint practices against the Eagles and Giants. He shredded New York's starting defense during the first day of back-to-back practices, calling audibles and beating exotic blitz pressure with his quick release. According to McCourty, it will take a similar scene for Maye to win the job.\n\n\"If he's out there and he's doing all the (offensive) line calls and he's comfortable and able to make throws and able to read coverage,\" McCourty said. \"that's what it will look like.\"\n\nAvoiding pressure is likely to be a regular part of playing quarterback for the Patriots next season.\n\nIf the kid can't handle the heat, sit him. That, among other reasons, is why many argue Brissett should start. Let him take the hits, while Maye develops risk-free.\n\nBut there is a world in which the Patriots' average offensive line out-performs expectations this summer, and Maye does, too.\n\nAt North Carolina, he showed flashes of identifying blitzes pre-snap and adjusting to beat that pressure. Overall, Maye killed the blitz in college, and destroyed certain opponents with his legs. However, there's a careful balance to beating pressure in the NFL.\n\nNot every answer can involve scrambling or extending plays outside of structure. Sometimes, a quarterback must stand in, find his hot read and take a hit. Or throw the ball away.\n\nMore often than not, beating the blitz requires calm and command in the pocket. McCourty cited ex-Jets quarterback Zach Wilson as a cautionary example of a young, athletic quarterback who too often tried to beat pressure by going outside of the offense, the pocket and himself.\n\nSource: Patriots begin process in search for de facto general manager\n\n\"How many times was (Wilson) just trying to make plays that he was able to make in college?\" McCourty asked. \"Drake Maye was able to (extend) at UNC. But I don't care who you bring in -- he's probably not going to be able do that in the NFL.\"\n\nIf Maye stands tall and unflinching against pressure this summer, while using all outlets at his disposal, that will be as sure a sign as any he's ready.\n\nOne of the first signs of Jones' readiness in 2021 was his increased aggression downfield. Slowly but surely, he ditched his Checkdown Charlie style and attacked the intermediate and deep parts of the field; evidence of growing confidence in his arm, his teammates and the offense.\n\nFor Maye, the inverse will hold true.\n\nIn college, Maye hunted explosive plays relentlessly. He eschewed shorter completions for home-run deep balls and succeeded often enough to keep swinging for the fences, even at the expense of a few singles. That mentality, plus his immense arm strength, inspired comparisons to Josh Allen during the pre-draft process.\n\nAllen came to dominate the Patriots because he started resisting the call of deep, dangerous throws and took checkdowns. McCourty remembers foiling Allen in his first couple seasons by ignoring Bills receivers running underneath routes, knowing Allen didn't want to settle for a short, boring completion.\n\nInside Patriots' decision to draft Drake Maye as future franchise QB\n\n\"We would watch clips where (Allen) would buy time and just wouldn't throw it to the back who would be wide open in the flat,\" he said.\n\nEventually, Allen's patience developed, and an elite quarterback was unlocked. Over the last four years, he went 7-2 versus Bill Belichick's defense and now owns the highest passer rating of any quarterback to make five-plus starts or attempt at least 200 passes versus Belichick. If Maye's college tape is indicative of how he'll attack NFL defenses, he must also learn to play the waiting game.\n\nThe good news: White believes patience can be taught.\n\n\"I think he can learn it,\" White said. \"It's not something that you have to know completely right away. I think that's a part of coaching and developing players.\"\n\nBy now you've heard about the flaw in Maye's game: his feet are a mess.\n\nFrantic at times, off-center at others. Maye's greatest gift -- his arm talent -- is both a blessing and a curse in that it allows him, maybe even encourages, to play without solid mechanics. He got away with it in college, but the margins are thinner and the windows are smaller in the NFL. Every detail matters.\n\nAgain, this is coachable. Footwork is fixable. Mechanics can be refined. But Maye must be willing and able to commit to those changes before he can change the Patriots' outlook this season, let alone for years to go.\n\n\"For all these guys, it's a learning curve. You don't have to know it all now. You can fix the footwork, you can fix reading coverage,\" White said. \"It's all about them learning and being willing to go out there and embrace it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_callahan@bostonherald.com", "name": "Andrew Callahan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_McCourty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Devin McCourty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_White_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James White (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MAYEsc011.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

In an offseason that has seen more change come to New England than at any time in recent memory, the first pick of a new era was obviously an important one. The man mostly tasked with making that pick was Patriots de facto (at least at the moment) general manager Eliot Wolf, who ran the scouting and draft process for the team.\n\nDuring an appearance on ESPN's \"The Adam Schefter Podcast,\" Wolf explained what led the team to identify Maye as its guy.\n\n\"I think just the talent and the person,\" Wolf said about Maye. \"He's a great person. He's tough. He's gritty. He was productive. He elevated those around him. And then, you know, he's 6-4.5, 225 pounds. He can really throw the ball. He's athletic. I think a combination of those things, you know, we think there's a lot to develop there with him whenever that time may be.\"\n\nThe \"whenever that time may be\" reference is an interesting one, as it seems to indicate that Maye not start right away. Given that New England signed Jacoby Brissett this offseason and that the supporting cast around Maye is still relatively lacking, it wouldn't be surprising if he spent at least part of the season operating as Brissett's backup.\n\nStill, a plan to potentially bring him along slowly doesn't detract from the confidence the team has in Maye, nor the things that attracted the team to him in the first place or his ability to become a leader in the locker room, Wolf said.\n\n\"His character, his passion for football, his drive. He's an all-around good person. He's really tough. He's all football, comes from a good family,\" Wolf said. \"I could go on and on about this guy ... He's a younger person. And ... as he assimilates into our locker room I think our players will, you know, will rally around him.\"\n\nWolf also noted that the Patriots didn't really give a lot of consideration to trading the pick, despite the pre-draft rumors they were interested in doing so. Wolf said the Pats were \"not close\" to dealing the selection.\n\nGiven how long the Patriots were led by Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, and how disappointing the post-Brady years of the Belichick era were, bringing in a prospect like Maye likely feels like a breath of fresh air. It remains to be seen how this era led by Maye, Wolf and new head coach Jerod Mayo turns out. It will be a long process to get the team where it wants to go, but they clearly feel like they have the first building block that will lay the groundwork for future success.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_dubin@cbssports.com", "name": "Jared Dubin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eliot Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/07/b7f3098d-9437-4e33-8d10-9df8520976fc/thumbnail/1200x675/bb202164ee59398d69a43f04f21266d6/drake-maye-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Drake is the newly minted New England Patriots quarterback after being the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Luke is in Japan playing pro basketball. They have big stuff happening in their respective sports.\n\nBut the text was about golf.\n\n\"Drake's talking about how he's getting a new driver for next time he plays,\" Luke said. \"He needs it because I just beat him about two weeks ago.\"\n\nGolf is like the athletic Switzerland for the Maye brothers. Neutral ground.\n\nLuke, 27, is a former North Carolina basketball national champion. Beau, 22, was a walk-on for UNC. Cole, 25, won an NCAA baseball title at Florida. None of them ever played golf at the collegiate level. Cole is the most practiced player, the first one to get a custom set of clubs.\n\nFootball, basketball and baseball aren't really fair playing fields for the Maye brothers. Golf levels the competition -- which is to say that golf fuels the competition. Most other sports are unsafe for these young men.\n\n\"I've watched them play two-on-two basketball, and it's a bloodbath,\" said Scott Chadwick, Drake Maye's high school coach.\n\nNow, to be clear, the Maye family is as nice and polite as they come. They are \"yes please, ma'am\" and \"no thank you, sir\" kind of guys. But they are also as competitive as they come. On the course, there are no gimmes. Drake will make his brothers putt everything out, even from four feet. It's 18 holes of trash talk, even when visitors join.\n\n\"I've missed a shot that cost us a hole,\" Chadwick said. \"I wanted to apologize so badly to Luke because now Luke had to listen to Drake trash-talking.\"\n\nThere aren't many competitions that Drake would shy away from. In fact, only one comes to mind. And we'll get to that. But New England's new QB seems obsessed with winning.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if I'm racing you out the door, or if we're on the field competing. I think competing to win, that's what Patriots Nation is about,\" he said.\n\nJust Tuesday, Maye was on Boston sports radio talking about rookie minicamp, where he'll see fellow rookie quarterback Joe Milton, New England's sixth-round pick. And while the 6-foot-4, 223-pound Maye had one of the strongest arms in the draft, Milton might have the strongest. So Maye fielded a question about whether he'd get into a distance competition with Milton.\n\nDrake's father, Mark, is a former UNC starting quarterback and NFL backup. Drake's mother, Aimee, was an excellent high school basketball player.\n\n\"She's probably the best athlete in our family,\" Luke said. \"She doesn't play [in the competitions] sometimes because she knows she'd be in a bad mood if she loses. But she's been incredible. She's super supportive of all of us. And I just don't think she gets enough credit.\"\n\nEveryone in the Maye family has some sort of superlative. Drake had been fighting for something other than \"youngest.\" Being a top-three NFL pick isn't too shabby.\n\nThat said, the Maye family values team success over individual success. Two of Drake's brothers have championship rings.\n\n\"I'm gonna slightly hold my championship still above him,\" Luke said with a chuckle.\n\nThere's plenty of time for Drake to chase a ring, and everyone around him is expecting big things. Super things.\n\n\"He is a guy who can win a Super Bowl,\" UNC coach Mack Brown said this week. \"Drake has really been groomed for this. I mean his whole family his whole life expects this. And the two brothers throw the rings in his face all the time. I've seen enough interviews where they say, 'Yeah, look here big boy. I've got this.'\"\n\nBrown added: \"I did tell him after the selection, 'Neither one of them were first-round picks, so you've got a little something on them right now.'\"\n\n[McKenna: Why Patriots QB Drake Maye couldn't be more different than Mac Jones]\n\nDrake's friends and family see the insane competitiveness everywhere, even in Ping-Pong. As a freshman at UNC, Maye challenged the team's starting QB, Sam Howell. When Howell beat Maye, the younger QB wouldn't accept defeat. It went from a best-of-one to a best-of-three to a best-of-five to a best-of-seven.\n\nA few years later, Coach Brown walked into the players' lounge after hearing a commotion. There was a Ping-Pong paddle, shattered into pieces.\n\n\"The tight end beat me. Can you imagine?\" Maye asked his coach.\n\nSometimes, that competitiveness might be to his detriment. Last October, heading into UNC's game against Virginia, Brown tried to get Maye to take a few practices off. His response? \"I can't miss practice. ... I gotta get better.\" The Tar Heels took their first loss of the year to Virginia. In the regular-season finale against 22nd-ranked NC State, Maye suffered an ankle injury in the first half. By halftime, UNC was down 26-7. Maye wasn't playing in the bowl game. He could have easily bowed out and called it a career.\n\n\"I thought he was gonna be out [with the ankle]. They were telling me he's probably out,\" UNC offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey said. \"It would have been really easy for him to kind of just ride off into the sunset. ... I go see him at halftime. We're down and he's [reviewing the first-half plays]. 'Coach, I like this. I like this. I like this. Let's go back to this.'\n\n\"He just never had any inkling that he wasn't gonna compete all the way to the end.\"\n\nBut then there are those special moments. Two stick out for his father, along with Brown, Lindsey and UNC Senior Advisor Clyde Christensen. The first is Maye's left-handed pass, akin to something Brett Favre or Patrick Mahomes might do.\n\nIn a game last September at Pitt, Maye was scrambling to his left with Panthers defenders closing in. It seemed like he planned on running for whatever he could get. But as a defender got a hand on Maye, the QB looked up and saw receiver Kobe Paysour put up a hand. He was wide open. So Maye lifted the ball in his left hand and chucked it up for Paysour. Touchdown.\n\nThat gives you a taste of Maye's flair for the dramatic -- and for his creativity. But his coaches wanted to make clear how badly he wants to win and how calm, composed and confident he gets in gotta-have-it situations. So the second moment that stands out to them came during UNC's 47-45, double-overtime win over Duke last November.\n\nOn North Carolina's two-point try in double overtime, Maye's first option was a screen on the boundary. He didn't like what he saw. Then he had a one-on-one out of the slot. Again, he didn't like what he saw. So he decided to tuck and run.\n\n\"As many options as we had, none of that looked great to me from upstairs,\" Lindsey said. \"He just decided to go run the draw after he looked this way. And then [the pocket] collapses and the guy that was one-on-one kind of just popped free. [Maye] just raised up and popped it to him. In a big moment, he never panicked and won the game.\"\n\nOK, but what about the time Maye walked away from a competition? Well, it's a long story that starts back in 2019, when Maye was a recruit committed to Alabama.\n\nEveryone thought he'd land at UNC like his dad and his brother. But during the recruitment process, Drake and Chadwick told scouts that the quarterback was not going to Carolina. Maye wanted it known that he was going to consider all his options -- and he had really good options. His top offers came from Alabama, Clemson and Ohio State. (He was the only QB in his prospect class to get offers from all three.) He made his decision to play for Nick Saban.\n\nAfter Maye committed to the Crimson Tide, however, Alabama managed to flip Bryce Young's commitment from USC. He was going to the Crimson Tide -- with Maye.\n\n\"[Then-Alabama OC Steve] Sarkisian had a long history with Bryce Young's family,\" Chadwick said. \"So in Drake's mind [he thought], 'I'm not gonna get an opportunity there as long as Bryce Young is there.'\"\n\nGiven the Sarkisian-Young connection, the folks close to Maye also wondered whether it would have been a real competition. Plus, according to Chadwick, Alabama had broken a promise to Maye that it wouldn't pursue another QB in his class.\n\nAll the while, UNC was jockeying for Maye, even after he'd committed to Bama. Former Carolina offensive coordinator Phil Longo -- just coincidentally, surely -- showed up at every Tar Heels basketball game that Maye attended to watch his big brother Luke. The arrival of Brown in 2019, too, seemed like a stellar addition at the right moment for UNC. It all changed Maye's mind.\n\nMaye walked into Chadwick's office and told him about his change of heart.\n\n\"I'm not calling Coach Saban,\" Chadwick told Maye.\n\nSo Drake called Saban and told him that he was decommitting from Alabama and going to UNC. Maye skipped the competition with Young. Instead, Maye would head to UNC, where he'd take on Howell. If he didn't win the job, Maye figured he could at least see the field after Howell left for the NFL.\n\nWas this shift an indicator of some underlying character issue? Doubtful.\n\n\"I would adopt him,\" Brown said. \"He's that perfect of a kid.\"\n\nIn the end, even Saban understood Maye's decision to decommit.\n\n\"I should be mad at him,\" Saban said during the ESPN broadcast on draft night. \"I get it, and it's a North Carolina family. He had a great career and he did a great job for the state and I have a lot of respect for this guy. This guy is wired right.\"\n\nGiven what happened to Maye at UNC in his final college season, it's fun to imagine him at Alabama. The Crimson Tide boasts an impressive supporting cast, with some of the top offensive linemen and receivers in the draft every year. That was not the case for the 2023 Tar Heels, whose offensive line allowed 37 sacks. Those protection issues compounded the footwork and decision-making problems Maye had in 2022, when he threw for 38 touchdowns with just seven picks. And so his film is probably better in his first season as a starter for UNC.\n\n\"He knows that he's got to tighten up his footwork and get himself aligned correctly and all the things that go into ... just dropping from under center,\" Christensen said.\n\nThat's what Maye is working on now. He's in North Carolina with Christensen and Lindsey sharpening his footwork and protections.\n\n\"That's a major, major, major difference in college and the pros. How do I handle the protections? Because all of a sudden, it falls on you,\" said Christensen, who has 27 years of NFL coaching experience.\n\nMaye has done some work with protections, but nothing at the level that he'll have to do in the NFL. Improving his footwork and protections should help prepare him for the smooth and steady transition he'll need to win the starting job for the Patriots.\n\nNew England signed veteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett in free agency. The team wants Brissett, Maye, Bailey Zappe and Milton to compete for the QB1 spot. Brissett is set to make $8 million for 2024, while Maye will make $9 million annually over his four-year deal. Maye has all the talent in the world, while Brissett is competent but not flashy.\n\nNew Patriots coach Jerod Mayo informed Maye in front of a few coaches that he would not automatically be the Day 1 starter. He'll have to earn the job. But given Maye's immense talent, his draft position and his salary, it would be hard to keep him off the field on Sunday. He'll get out there in 2024 -- and likely in Week 1.\n\n[McKenna: Would Patriots really sit No. 3 overall pick Drake Maye to start the season?]\n\nThe main attribute that separates Maye beyond his mindset is his arm talent. But arm talent is a tricky thing. It's mostly based on the eye test. It's not like weight or height or even speed and agility, where you can measure and quantify a player's physical gifts.\n\n\"I always get mad when people start throwing around the term 'arm talent,'\" Christensen said. \"I'm not 100 percent sure exactly what that means. For me, what I care about is: Have you seen him make every throw? Can he throw the ball accurately? Does he have enough arm to throw the downfield stuff? Does he have enough touch to drop balls over top of tight coverage? Does he have an anticipation with his arm?\"\n\nWhen watching Maye's film, the answer to every one of Christensen's questions is: Yes.\n\nMaye has shown he can elevate an offense around him. That's what drew Patriots de-facto GM Eliot Wolf to the prospect. Maye will certainly need to do that with New England, which had one of the least-talented offensive units in the NFL last year. And while the organization did some roster reshuffling this offseason, it wasn't the overhaul many expected given how much cap space the Patriots had going into free agency. They still don't really have a WR1 -- nor do they have a left tackle. (Is it veteran Chukwuma Okorafor or rookie Caedan Wallace -- who played on the right in college -- or someone not yet on the team?)\n\nSo many of the lessons Maye learned at UNC will be applicable if he takes over this season. No matter if he struggles or instantly succeeds, he's probably going to be a popular man in New England's locker room. He takes care of his own. When NIL money started pouring in at Carolina, Maye negotiated a sponsorship offer into a bigger deal involving his offensive linemen. When he got an offer for free seafood, he asked the company if it could include his receivers and their families.\n\nChristensen, who worked with Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as an NFL coach, sees Maye's thoughtfulness and leadership as overlapping qualities with those legends.\n\n\"I think he has a lot of the same traits that give you a chance to be great,\" Christensen said. \"He processes information extremely well -- a lot like Peyton. He has a humbleness and humility like Tom that players played for. He has that kind of humility that just attracts teammates. He's going to be a great teammate.\"\n\nMaye knows when to show love for his guys. He knows when to encourage them to be better. And like Brady, he knows when and how to fire them up when they're not playing well enough to get a W.\n\n\"I don't think that's a small characteristic to share with Tom,\" Christensen said.\n\nMaye is the future in New England. And the Patriots hope that future shares many characteristics with their past, especially their past with Brady.\n\nPrior to joining FOX Sports as the AFC East reporter, Henry McKenna spent seven years covering the Patriots for USA TODAY Sports Media Group and Boston Globe Media.

His former head coach weighs in", "body": "Being the third pick overall, the expectation would be for Drake Maye to have the ability to elevate the offense and lead a team.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina head coach Mack Brown, who spoke with reporters on a Zoom call Monday, says the Patriots rookie quarterback has those qualities in spades.\n\nJust his presence on the field has an impact.\n\n\"He absolutely does (elevate) a team. He will work as hard, or harder, than any player on the Patriots team. And you can't lead unless you're the hardest worker,\" Brown said. \"But they're going to admire him. He's going to be tough. He's not selfish. He's going to want to win, even if he's not the guy. When Sam Howell was playing, he was so supportive, leading on the sideline, and so excited when they won.\n\n\"So he is totally about winning.\"\n\nBrown also believes Maye provides a boost just by being the head of the offense, fielding snaps as the quarterback of the team. He referenced the last two Duke games the Tar Heels played, with Maye leading late comeback wins.\n\n\"We beat Duke with 16 seconds in Durham last year. They actually scored with 40 seconds left in the game, and he took us right down, and made plays, to put us in position for a field goal,\" Brown said. \"And then he takes us down, and just runs the ball in to win the game in double overtime. So, that's him.\n\n\"He's the guy that when he walks out on the field, you think you're going to score. That's what I like about him so much. He walks with confidence, but not arrogance. He's fun for the players. He has a unique way to get on them, and elevate their play without yelling at 'em, because they want to please him, and they want to play hard for him ... they do not want to let him down, and that's another unique quality he has.\"\n\nBrown said the players believed they would win every game because Maye was on their side. The only drawback, was when the defense didn't deliver.\n\n\"Sometimes our guys thought he was going to win every game, and sometimes our defense didn't play as well because they knew he was going to outscore the opponent,\" Brown said. \"So, that was the only bad thing. Everybody believed in him so much, that they just thought he was going to win every game.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mack Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Howell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Howell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Tar Heels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/6XBXBVSDKRBUBBGBBBLDGU6PGA.jpg?auth=1038d58bae758338f24cd99d8a08b1ff80738258828608d576482e5dfcfdc8c6&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Nick O'Malley/MassLive.com\n\nMinutes after the Patriots selected quarterback Drake Maye third overall in the 2024 NFL Draft, Jerod Mayo made it very clear his rookie quarterback is not guaranteed a starting job in Week 1.\n\nThe new New England head coach even reiterated the point later in his post-first-round press conference, saying, \"We're not sitting here saying that Drake is our starting quarterback.\"\n\nBut Mayo also said that if Maye can beat out veteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who was signed in free agency as a potential bridge starter or mentor, through coaching and hard work then, \"he has a chance to go out there and really - to really play at a high level.\"\n\nThose would be strong words from Mayo's predecessor. But one thing we've learned early in Mayo's tenure as head coach is that he's quicker to dole out praise than Bill Belichick.\n\nIn asking scouts and executives around the NFL how they view Maye's ceiling if he's thrust into a starting role in Year 1, it's not out of the question that Maye can start in Week 1. Just last season, the three quarterbacks selected in the top four picks of the 2023 NFL Draft - Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Anthony Richardson - started the season.\n\nIn 2021, Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson and Mac Jones all started, and in 2020, Joe Burrow started Week 1. One AFC East scout believed that Lawrence's rookie season was a good place to set Maye's ceiling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If he starts, I'd say something like Trevor Lawrence's rookie year, in terms of stats,\" he said. \"Probably more TD's than that, but that's the ballpark.\"\n\nLawrence, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, completed 59.6% of his passes for 3,641 yards with 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions while going 3-14 as a starter.\n\nAn AFC North scout also set expectations for Maye around Lawrence's rookie season.\n\n\"I think he rides ups and downs, for sure, but ultimately ends up having a solid year where you see a lot of good potential,\" he said. \"Somewhere between Lawrence in 2021 and Tua (Tagovailoa) in 2022.\"\n\nHe expected around 3,500 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for Maye. Tagovailoa, the fifth pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, entered the league in a similar situation as Maye with Ryan Fitzpatrick in place as a bridge starter. Tagovailoa started nine games, went 6-3, completed 64.1% of his passes and threw for 1,814 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions.\n\nA second AFC East scout, who had Maye ranked as the No. 2 QB in the draft behind Caleb Williams, is optimistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think he can be pretty good as a rookie,\" he said. \"There's gonna be some growing pains, but if it comes together he'll be good.\"\n\nThat same scout believes Maye is a quarterback the team can win because of, not just with. He also noted Maye is more physically impressive than the Patriots' starters over the last three seasons - Jones, Brian Hoyer and Bailey Zappe.\n\nAn AFC West executive had lower expectations, saying he couldn't envision Maye \"setting the world on fire\" in Year 1. That being said, he said it was hard to predict given the Patriots' new coaching staff and roster changes.\n\nThe Patriots brought on board offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, quarterbacks coach T.C. McCartney and senior offensive assistant Ben McAdoo. They'll have new starters at \"X\" wide receiver and left tackle, brought in running back Antonio Gibson, tight end Austin Hooper and offensive tackle Chukwuma Okorafor in free agency, and drafted wide receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker, offensive linemen Caedan Wallace and Layden Robinson and tight end Jaheim Bell.\n\nA senior AFC North executive believes Maye will be solid as a rookie but, the \"supporting cast is the biggest thing that'll hold him back.\"\n\nPlayers like Polk and Baker have high upside but could experience their own growing pains acclimating to starting roles as rookies. And the top options at left tackle, Okorafor and Wallace, have both played a lot more right tackle in recent years. Okorafor hasn't started at left tackle since college. Wallace hasn't started at the position since high school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Okorafor was drafted by the Steelers as a left tackle before moving to, and settling into, right tackle. Wallace was blocked by Jets first-round pick Olu Fashanu on the left side.\n\nFinally, a third AFC East scout had the highest ceiling of all for Maye, believing his ceiling is that of \"a difference maker that gets the Patriots back into the playoff conversation.\" That's high praise for a rookie joining a team that went 4-13 last season.\n\nRealistically, however, that scout said that while the Patriots addressed many of their needs this offseason, they still need to fix even more \"to get to a real place where they allow him to truly be successful as a Year 1 starter.\"\n\nSince 2014, there have been 33 rookie quarterbacks to start at least eight games. Jones ranks second behind only Dak Prescott among those 33 QBs in passing success rate as a rookie. Bills quarterback Josh Allen, whom Maye has compared himself to, ranks sixth lowest. So, rookie performance isn't truly indicative of future success.\n\nTHE 2023 NFL season marked the first that NFL players were allowed to wear the No. 0. Last season, however, no one on the Patriots' roster took up the honor. After getting drafted in the first round, Christian Gonzalez wore No. 6 for his first NFL season.\n\nThis offseason, however, he made the switch to No. 0 and will become the first player in Patriots franchise history to don the number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he transferred to Oregon, he wanted to wear No. 3. That was the number he wore in high school and then at his first collegiate stop, Colorado. The problem was that No. 3 was in use with defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus. That's what led him to the No. 0. At first, Gonzalez wasn't thrilled.\n\n\"I got it in college. It wasn't really my first choice. I wanted to wear No. 3,\" Gonzalez said this week. \"Three was the number I wore in high school and sophomore year of college, I transferred and 3 was taken, so they said 0 was an option. I honestly didn't like it at first until they started playing with Gonzo, Zero, and Oregon. I put it on and really liked it.\"\n\nGonzalez declined the option to switch to No. 3.\n\n\"I haven't worn three in two years. I wanted zero,\" Gonzalez said. \"Zero, I could be the first Patriot to wear it. That's cool.\"\n\nGM SEARCH: Panthers vice president of football administration Samir Suleiman is interviewing with the Patriots as part of their search for a new personnel leader in their front office, according to reports.\n\nDirector of scouting Eliot Wolf, who led the Patriots' front office all offseason, is widely seen as the favorite to get the job. However, by opening a search, the Patriots are required to satisfy league hiring rules; specifically the Rooney Rule, which mandates at least two in-person interviews with external minority and/or female candidates.\n\nSuleiman has worked in Carolina since 2020 and served as the Panthers' top contract negotiator. He previously spent seven years in Pittsburgh as the Steelers' football administration coordinator from 2013-2019 and 10 seasons with the Rams as director of football administration (2000-2009).\n\nIt's possible the Patriots could hire one or both executives to other front-office positions underneath Wolf, should Wolf maintain his roster control and earn a new title. Suleiman and Hunt are the only known external candidates in this search, which began with three external minority candidates reportedly turning them down. The Patriots have previously used coordinator searches to pursue assistant coaches who were passed over for the coordinator job.\n\nDEMARIO DOUGLAS, the Patriots' second-year wideout, explained his decision to change jersey numbers to No. 3 by saying it's the same number he wore in middle school, high school and college.

Drake Maye 'excited' for Pats' new QB room", "body": "The New England Patriots' quarterback room will look a whole lot different in 2024 -- both from a personnel perspective and a physical trait perspective.\n\nOut are Mac Jones (traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars) and Nathan Rourke (released), with Bailey Zappe a candidate to be traded or released as well. In are veteran Jacoby Brissett (signed in free agency) and a pair of rookies in UNC's Drake Maye (No. 3 overall pick) and Tennessee's Joe Milton (No. 193 overall pick).\n\nMaye was touted as one of the hardest-throwing passers in the 2024 NFL Draft class, but the Patriots brought in the one rookie QB who may throw harder in Milton, whose rocket arm is the stuff of legend.\n\nMaye told 98.5 The Sports Hub's Zolak & Bertrand on Tuesday he's looking forward to working with (and competing against) both Milton and Brissett, who was Washington Commanders teammates last season with Maye's former UNC teammate, Sam Howell.\n\n\"Jacoby has reached out to me, and I got to know him pretty well through Sam (Howell), so he's been awesome,\" Maye said, as seen in the video player above. \"I'm just looking forward to getting to work with him. Obviously I know Joe Milton from college, seeing him at camps and the Manning Camp and some of these other times you cross paths with him.\n\n\"So, I'm looking forward to being in that room. I think we've got a great room. So I'm just excited to be with those guys and compete.\"\n\nMight area where those QBs -- particularly Maye and Milton -- compete be in the \"strongest arm\" category? When co-host Scott Zolak posed the idea of a throwing competition between the two rookies, Maye seemed up to the challenge.\n\n\"Joe can throw it, now. But hey, I ain't gonna turn it down, now. I ain't gonna turn it down,\" Maye responded.\n\nMilton probably would be favored in that contest, but we respect Maye's competitive spirit. And even if the 21-year-old doesn't have the strongest arm in the room, he's committed to being the most well-prepared.\n\n\"The biggest thing is being detailed,\" Maye said when asked what he's working on ahead of his first NFL training camp. \"With (offensive coordinator Alex) Van Pelt's offense, knowing all the details first -- I think going out there like a deer in the headlights as a rookie is not smart.\n\n\"So, fine-tuning that and really getting to study it and get to know it and be able to teach it back to somebody -- that's how kind I learn things; being able to teach it back to somebody is when I really feel like you know it. So, grinding that and getting really detailed in the playbook and the formations, all the motions, all the little stuff.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Zolak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Zolak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Howell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Howell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ-FM", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WBZ-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/04/Drake-Maye-USATSI_23115015.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

But one thing we've learned early in Mayo's tenure as head coach is that he's quicker to dole out praise than Bill Belichick.\n\nSo, we asked scouts and executives around the NFL how they view Maye's ceiling if he's thrust into a starting role in Year 1. And it's not out of the question that Maye can start in Week 1. Just last season, the three quarterbacks selected in the top four picks of the 2023 NFL Draft, Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Anthony Richardson, started the season.\n\nIn 2021, Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson and Mac Jones all started, and in 2020, Joe Burrow started Week 1.\n\nOne AFC East scout believed that Lawrence's rookie season was a good place to set Maye's ceiling.\n\n\"If he starts, I'd say something like Trevor Lawrence's rookie year, in terms of stats,\" he said. \"Probably more TD's than that, but that's the ballpark.\"\n\nLawrence, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, completed 59.6% of his passes for 3,641 yards with 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions while going 3-14 as a starter.\n\nAn AFC North scout also set expectations for Maye around Lawrence's rookie season.\n\n\"I think he rides ups and downs, for sure, but ultimately ends up having a solid year where you see a lot of good potential,\" he said. \"Somewhere between Lawrence in 2021 and Tua (Tagovailoa) in 2022.\"\n\nHe expected around 3,500 yards with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for Maye. Tagovailoa, the fifth overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, entered the league in a similar situation as Maye with Ryan Fitzpatrick in place as a bridge starter. Tagovailoa started nine games, went 6-3, completed 64.1% of his passes and threw for 1,814 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions.\n\nA second AFC East scout, who had Maye ranked as the No. 2 QB in the 2024 NFL Draft behind Caleb Williams, is optimistic.\n\n\"I think he can be pretty good as a rookie,\" he said. \"There's gonna be some growing pains, but if it comes together he'll be good.\"\n\nThat same scout believes Maye is a quarterback the team can win because of, not just with. He also noted Maye is more physically impressive than the Patriots' starters over the last three seasons, Jones, Brian Hoyer and Bailey Zappe.\n\nAn AFC West executive had lower expectations, saying he couldn't envision Maye \"setting the world on fire\" in Year 1. That being said, he said it was hard to predict given the Patriots' new coaching staff and roster changes.\n\nThe Patriots brought on board offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, quarterbacks coach T.C. McCartney and senior offensive assistant Ben McAdoo. They'll have new starters at \"X\" wide receiver and left tackle and brought on board running back Antonio Gibson, tight end Austin Hooper and offensive tackle Chukwuma Okorafor in free agency, and drafted wide receivers Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker, offensive linemen Caedan Wallace and Layden Robinson and tight end Jaheim Bell.\n\nA senior AFC North executive believes Maye will be solid as a rookie but, the \"supporting cast is the biggest thing that'll hold him back.\"\n\nPlayers like Polk and Baker have high upside but could experience their own growing pains acclimating to starting roles as rookies. And the top options at left tackle, Okorafor and Wallace, have both played a lot more right tackle in recent years. Okorafor hasn't started at left tackle since college. Wallace hasn't started at the position since high school.\n\nBut Okorafor was drafted by the Steelers as a left tackle before moving to and settling into right tackle. Wallace was blocked by Jets first-round pick Olu Fashanu on the left side.\n\nFinally, a third AFC East scout had the highest ceiling of all for Maye, believing his ceiling is that of \"a difference maker that gets the Patriots back into the playoff conversation.\" That's high praise for a rookie joining a team that went 4-13 last season.\n\nRealistically, however, that scout said that while the Patriots addressed many of their needs this offseason, they still need to fix even more \"to get to a real place where they allow him to truly be successful as a Year 1 starter.\"\n\nSince 2014, there have been 33 rookie quarterbacks to start at least eight games. Jones ranks second behind only Dak Prescott among those 33 QBs in passing success rate as a rookie. Bills quarterback Josh Allen, whom Maye has compared himself to, ranks sixth lowest. So, rookie performance isn't truly indicative of future success. Remember that no matter how Maye looks as a rookie.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_kyed@bostonherald.com", "name": "Doug Kyed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hoyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hoyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_McAdoo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben McAdoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Hooper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Drake-Maye.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

That's kinda one of the best parts about coming to the new team is getting acclimated with the guys, getting to know 'em, show 'em what I'm about... I'm just excited.\"\n\nThe quarterback battle will be fun to follow during training camp. Jacoby Brissett is the veteran in the room and figures to get a fair amount of playing time this season.\n\nWith that said, it's not unreasonable to expect Maye to make a push right out of the gates as well. It's safe to say he is up for the challenge.", "source": {"uri": "patriotswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Patriots Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_jaillet@patriotswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Danny Jaillet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/04/USATSI_23119198_168386657_lowres.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Maye is the type of guy you want your daughter to marry, he says. Yet, somehow, the New England Patriots rookie quarterback handles himself on the football field like an assassin in an action movie.\n\n\"That's Drake,\" Chadwick said.\n\nNESN.com spoke with Chadwick, Scott Taylor, Maye's high school basketball coach at Myers Park, as well as members of the North Carolina Tar Heels staff including head football coach Mack Brown, offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey and senior advisor Clyde Christensen about New England's next franchise quarterback.\n\nAll shared similar sentiments as Chadwick. They love his leadership, his competitive nature and his coachability. They love the things that drive Maye's opponents nuts.\n\nChadwick can still recall one of the first times he heard about Maye. The Myers Park Mustangs were set to face nearby Hough High in a 2017 North Carolina High School Athletic Association state quarterfinals matchup. Maye was Hough's second-string quarterback behind a junior signal-caller.\n\n\"A lot of coaches in the area told me, 'Hey, whatever you do, don't knock the junior out because the freshman they have is better,'\" Chadwick said. \"They said, 'You want to play against that kid and not the freshman they've got.'\"\n\nThe Maye family was viewed as North Carolina royalty, similar to the Mannings in New Orleans and the Gronkowskis in Buffalo. Drake is the youngest of the Maye boys, behind Luke, Cole and Beau, and he followed in their footsteps.\n\n\"He came with a lot of hype, no question,\" Chadwick said.\n\nChadwick's first chance to work with Maye actually came following the QB's freshman season. The coach ran a quarterback academy with former NFL signal-caller and current Minnesota Vikings assistant Josh McCown where Maye was a pupil, and it didn't take long for the hype to become a reality.\n\nChadwick quickly formed a relationship with the Maye family. When it became clear Hough intended to start the rising senior for another season, Chadwick's relationship with the Mayes made Myers Park an ideal landing spot. Drake and his father, Mark, moved to the Myers Park side of Charlotte ahead of his sophomore year.\n\nChadwick and the Mustangs staff made Maye earn the starting job as a sophomore transfer, especially since they had their own rising senior on the depth chart. But it was clear Maye would take over. He finally did in late July when Myers Park went away for camp.\n\nMaye played two high school seasons under Chadwick, his sophomore and junior campaigns. His senior season, a season where Myers Park had two nationally televised ESPN games on its schedule, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt was a disappointing lost opportunity for the coach-QB duo. During the two prior seasons, Chadwick had a front-row seat as Maye threw 50 touchdowns and just three interceptions during his junior year. Maye completed 72.4% of his passes while Myers Park solidified itself as the top program in the state.\n\nChadwick saw Maye as an unrivaled competitor behind center. As a sophomore, Maye struggled in their only regular-season loss, throwing three of his five picks in defeat against Butler. Given a chance at revenge in the playoffs, Maye promised his teammates it wouldn't happen again. He threw four touchdowns in a 33-8 playoff win the night after Thanksgiving.\n\nThen, a year later, it was Maye who encouraged Chadwick to schedule Hough, giving him a shot at his former team. Chadwick obliged, and Myers Park filled an opening in its non-conference schedule with a Hough team that ranked top 10 in the state. Maye went off for seven touchdowns, throwing for six and running in another before leaving with a 68-7 Myers Park lead. The Mustangs, who averaged averaged 50 points that season, won 68-21.\n\nThat will to compete extended beyond the gridiron. Maye took no mercy on his high school basketball teammates in \"NBA 2K\" on Xbox, never losing and making sure his name and record were reflected on the team board, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor also reflected on the times Myers Park went on the road and Drake heard chants like 'Stick to football!' and 'Luke is better!\" -- a reference to Drake's oldest brother, Luke, a national champion and hero at North Carolina after his game-winning bucket lifted the Tar Heels over the Kentucky Wildcats and to the Final Four in March 2017. Drake, the 6-foot-5 sophomore forward would typically respond by converting an early bucket and shush the crowd. Taylor also chuckled when he mentioned the time Maye heard chatter from a player on an opposing team. Maye responded by listing off that player's offer sheet, which was filled with Division II schools and programs that didn't hold a candle to the ones Maye heard from.\n\n\"Competition is fun to him,\" Taylor said. \"I think that's when I see him smile the brightest.\"\n\nI think that's when I see him smile the brightest.\n\nOne moment that stands out most to Taylor, though, was during Maye's sophomore season. Myers Park traveled to Northwest Guilford for a playoff game. When the Mustangs held a two-possession lead in the final minute, Taylor figured he would call a timeout to run a good play. Before he could, however, Maye grabbed a rebound, ran down the court in transition and pulled up for a 3-pointer. Maye then stole the ball on Northwest Guilford's next possession, dunked it and hung on the rim as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\"For me, that's the one I'll probably always remember,\" Taylor said.\n\nMaye considered playing college basketball, Taylor said, and had interest from a handful of ACC schools including Virginia, Clemson and Notre Dame. Brown, the Tar Heels football coach, said Maye could have been North Carolina's sixth man.\n\nThe legendary college football coach was happy to have Maye on his own squad, even if the QB's fiery nature cost the program a ping-pong paddle or two. Maye's competitiveness was on display in some signature Carolina wins against Duke his sophomore and junior seasons -- Maye led the Tar Heels on game-winning drives in those contests.\n\nBut, as others hinted, Maye's fire doesn't just burn on the biggest stage. Brown recalled a time he walked into the Tar Heels' players lounge to a broken ping-pong paddle. The visibly distraught Maye stood there after he went up against North Carolina tight end John Copenhaver.\n\n'The tight end beat me!'\" Maye told Brown. \"The tight end beat me! Can you imagine?!'\"\n\nLindsey recalled the midweek accuracy contests he held between Maye and the Tar Heels quarterbacks. Lindsey planned to cancel that target practice one time as to concentrate on individual drills. Maye, though, pushed back.\n\n\"That was a big part of the week for him,\" Lindsey said, while also mentioning Maye's admiration for pickleball.\n\nChristensen worked with Maye during the 2023 season and ahead of the NFL draft. However, he's known the Maye family for a long time given his relationship with Drake's dad, Mark. A family trip to the links, which Christensen joined, provided the quarterback guru his own insight.\n\n\"Probably one of my fondest stories would be one time I golfed with him and his brother,\" Christensen said. \"His brother had a four-and-a-half incher and Drake made him putt it out. 'Don't pick that up, you got to putt that out!' And it was probably under six inches.\n\n\"He just has a playfulness, he loves to compete,\" Christensen said.\n\n...\n\nThat arguably maniacal relationship with competition might be why many find it hard to believe in the 'aw shucks' demeanor that comes with Maye's southern drawl.\n\nBut those who know him know that's how Maye threads the needle.\n\n\"I do think he's got a unique character and ability to have a humility that carries with him, while also having a competitive nature,\" Taylor said. \"I hope it's appreciated and seen. Because he is tenacious in how he works and how he approaches it, but there's a true sense of gratitude and humility towards everybody around him.\n\n\"That is not fabricated in any way. That is truly him and it's unique. It's really unique.\"\n\nThe 72-year-old Brown, a veteran football coach of 46 years, said he wished Maye was part of his family.\n\n\"I would adopt him,\" Brown said. \"He's that perfect of a kid. It sounds kind of corny, but it's true.\"\n\nMany credited Drake's parents, Mark and Aimee, both college athletes themselves, for instilling the right values in the four Maye boys. They have a healthy relationship with competition and can maintain a level of respect, humbleness and humility.\n\nTaylor recalled when Maye joined the basketball team his sophomore and junior seasons. It came when the Mustangs were three or four games into the season, a product of the football team's extended playoff runs. Maye, Taylor said, didn't want to disrupt what Myers Park had going, and didn't want to overshadow the hoopers who spent the offseason on the hardwood.\n\n\"He was willing to do whatever it meant, come off the bench, take a little bit of a lesser role offensively, almost so as not to upset the guys that had been putting in the time and effort,\" Taylor said. \"He was genuine with it.\"\n\nMaye instead did the overlooked work. He'd make the extra pass, set screens and get rebounds for his teammates. He did the work of a role player rather than the star, despite the fact he was the latter. That was until his Mustangs teammates and coaches encouraged him to start playing to his full potential.\n\nLindsey, who took the offensive coordinator job at North Carolina after Maye's standout sophomore season, said one of the first things that stood out to him was Maye's humbleness. Entering his pivotal junior campaign, Maye told Lindsey he wanted to be coached and critiqued. It was a sentiment that doesn't always come from someone named the ACC Player of the Year the season prior.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't find that with these big-time players,\" Lindsey said.\n\nMaye's sincerity has always stood out to Chadwick, too. Instead of rambling about his life-changing achievement and excitement, Maye in their first call after the Patriots drafted him, spent the first 10 minutes of their conversation asking his former coach about his current team's offseason.\n\nDuring the pre-draft process, Chadwick was contacted by an NFL team. The team, which Chadwick didn't reveal, asked if Maye was similar to the Eddie Haskell character in \"Leave It To Beaver.\" He pushed back.\n\n\"That is so far from the truth,\" Chadwick relayed. \"He is completely one of the finest kids -- I call him a kid -- but he's one of the finest kids I've ever been around.\"\n\nChristensen said he learned more about Maye's character when he watched him communicate with his North Carolina teammates. Christensen praised Maye for how he married positive reinforcement with constructive criticism. Christensen, who served as Tom Brady's quarterbacks coach in Tampa Bay before joining the Tar Heels staff, even said it was one of the traits Maye has in common with Brady.\n\n\"I don't think that's a small characteristic to share with Tom,\" Christensen said.\n\nThose who know him know it's just another example of Maye threading the needle.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_t_mcguire@nesn.com", "name": "Sean T.

Similarly to the Pats Pulpit staff, the consensus among fans was that quarterback Drake Maye -- who the team selected third overall -- was fans' favorite selection, according to SB Nation's latest Reacts survey.\n\nIt should not come as a major surprise, as poor quarterback play led the Patriots to a 4-13 record last season to secure the No. 3 pick.

Fourth-round pick Javon Baker, who previously knew Maye from their time committed to Alabama together, was voted the most underrated selection of the team's entire draft.\n\nBaker, who received 35 percent of the votes, was followed by seventh-round tight end Jaheim Bell and second-round wide receiver Ja'Lynn Polk in the most underrated voting.\n\nAs Baker believes the selections will help bring the winning ways back to New England, fans tend to agree -- as 90 percent of Patriots' fans left the draft believing the team was a winner.", "source": {"uri": "patspulpit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pats Pulpit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_hines@patspulpit.com", "name": "Brian Hines", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaheim_Bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaheim Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7H1KXy2IEI35BWY0mZLOSvyeUpM=/0x40:3600x1840/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25421829/usa_today_23120753.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "dateEnd": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 271, "textEnd": 280}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Then in a curious move, the team opted for Joe Milton five rounds later.\n\nSo out of the 11 quarterbacks taken in the draft, two of them ended up with the Patriots. Eliot Wolf, the de facto GM for New England, said the pick made sense in the Patriots War Room.\n\n\"It was just one of those picks where there was too much talent in him to pass that up,\" Wolf told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nMaye, the former North Carolina star, was one of the most-touted quarterbacks in the lead up to the draft. He ended up as the No. 3 player selected behind Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels. So obviously, New England views him as its guy under center.\n\nMilton is the former Tennessee star who always was projected as a third-day pick. He became the fourth quarterback on the Patriots roster. The team signed veteran Jacoby Brissett and kept Bailey Zappe from last year's team. Earlier, New England traded former first-rounder Mac Jones, who started the past three seasons, to the Jaguars.\n\nWolf said he watched Milton in person when the Vols faced Vanderbilt. He came away with plenty of reasons to want to draft him.\n\n\"I got there really early and watched him warm up,\" Wolf told Schefter. \"Just watching him throw the football is unbelievable.\n\n\"He's 6-5, 245 pounds. He's got a rocket for an arm. He's athletic. He played in (Tennessee head coach Josh) Heupel's offense there. It's not an NFL offense, but we feel like there's some things that we can work with and develop.\"\n\nSo the Patriots will need to ready Maye to start. And if they can, they'll craft Milton into NFL shape. In the meantime, they can rely on Brissett. He's 31 and has played for five NFL teams. This is his second time on the Patriots roster. New England selected the former NC State star in the third round of the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\n\"We've spent time with Drake and Joe,\" Wolf told Schefter. \"But we haven't had a work day with them yet. They'll get in here next week. We'll gauge where they're at. We'll gauge where the coaching staff thinks there at.\"\n\nWolf then mentioned the older QB.\n\n\"We know where Jacoby's at,\" he said. \"He's been here working his tail off since the offseason program started.

Picture Credits: USA TODAY Sports and Instagram @mina_kimes\n\nThe New England Patriots chose former North Carolina QB Drake Maye with their third overall pick in this year's draft. With concerns about his playing time, there's a feeling that he might not be getting meaningful snaps this season.\n\nESPN's Mina Kimes weighed in on Maye's situation in the recent episode of her podcast, acknowledging that he might not be in the most ideal spot with the Patriots, but he's not as questionable a pick as some perceive him to be. During her conversation with Bleacher Reports' Derrick Klassen, she added:\n\n\"I don't think it's quite as bad as people say. Maybe, that's my Kendrick Bourne love and Ja'Lynn Polk fandom getting in my own way.\"\n\nMina Kimes further discussed how the New England Patriots have been making solid moves to strengthen their roster. She pointed out that their offensive line has improved compared to the struggles fans witnessed in recent years.\n\nMina also had a suggestion for the team. According to her, the team should look for a standout wide receiver to mentor the younger players and elevate the team's overall performance.\n\nIt's possible that the Patriots will opt to have Drake Maye observe and learn during his first season, a strategy often debated in quarterback development. There have been some rookies like Patrick Mahomes and Carson Palmer who have excelled after a year of learning.\n\nMoreover, Maye's strong field vision suggests the Patriots trust he'll adapt and develop over time.\n\nDrake Maye steps into the Patriots' lineup as the potential future face of the franchise. As a matter of fact, he seems set to elevate the team's competitive edge even further. Like the next Patriots general manager, Elliot Wolf had his eye on Maye pre-draft and he considered two key factors that influenced his evaluation of the North Carolina standout quarterback.\n\nWolf added on \"The Adam Schefter Podcast\" earlier this week:\n\n\"The talent and the person. He's a great person. He's tough. He's gritty. He was productive. He elevated those around him. He's 6-foot-4 1/2 and 225 pounds. He can really throw the ball. He's athletic. I think it's a combination of those things. We think there's a lot to develop with him whenever that time may be.\"\n\nWolf was singing Maye's praises, pointing out his character, passion, and unwavering dedication to the game being a factor that he thought to be impressive. Moreover, Wolf highlighted his toughness and strong family background, describing the North Carolina star as \"all football\".\n\nWith such commendable qualities, Wolf believes Drake Maye will smoothly integrate into the Patriots' locker room and even rally the players around him as he continues to grow.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yagya_bhargava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Yagya Bhargava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina_Kimes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mina Kimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Palmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carson Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/d6845595-yagya-fis-77.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Now with a new man under center leading the charge with a sky-high ceiling to develop into, it brings more optimism to an offense that hasn't had much to hang their hat on in the past three seasons.\n\nBut when taking a look as to what we can expect from Maye going into his first year in Foxboro, it's a bit hard to project at this point. He's still a raw, young prospect with a few technicals to iron out before we consider him one of the premier talents in the league.\n\nStill, some around the NFL are starting to pin predictions on how we could see Maye's 2024 pan out on this Patriots roster.\n\nWhen speaking to anonymous scouts about the potential Maye has in this Patriots offense for year one, Doug Kyed of The Boston Herald says one AFC East scout sees some similarities between the UNC signal-caller and current Jacksonville Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence.\n\n\"If [Drake Maye] starts, I'd say something like Trevor Lawrence's rookie year, in terms of stats,\" the scout said. \"Probably more TD's than that, but that's the ballpark.\"\n\nWhen looking back to Lawrence's rookie year in 2021, it came with it's fair share of ups and downs before he came to develop into the player he is today. Through 17 games, he had 3,641 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions with his brief stint under Urban Meyer.\n\nThose numbers aren't jumping off the page by any means, but it does make for some interesting parallels between the two quarterbacks. Lawrence entered Jacksonville with a shaky supporting cast, a first-year NFL head coach, and possessed several physical tools that made him stand out as a potential franchise-shifting player.\n\nIt took some time for the development to come to form, but the Jaguars would soon make their run to an AFC divisional game just one year later. Jacksonville managed to put an ample supporting cast around their number-one overall pick, and the Clemson product then managed to produce.\n\nIt's very much possible we could see the Patriots fall into the same mold with Maye. Even if the wins don't stack onto the board in 2024, there's enough upside to still hold faith in this core even past this season.\n\nThis rebuild could be an extensive process. There are still some holes within the Patriots' weapons, the offensive line has a few questions, and we don't quite know what to expect from rookie HC Jerod Mayo.

According to the Pats' director of scouting, Milton had \"too much talent to pass up\" despite the team taking Drake Maye No. 3 overall. If recent history is any indication, Milton could end up having a better professional career than Maye.\n\nThe New England Patriots secured their quarterback of the future in the 2024 NFL Draft when they turned down tempting trade offers for the selection they used on North Carolina signal-caller Drake Maye. That didn't stop them from adding another tantalizing QB prospect late on day three, though.\n\nIn the sixth round, Patriots director of scouting Eliot Wolf nabbed Tennessee's Joe Milton III with pick No. 193, electing to add further competition to New England's positional room already consisting of Maye, Jacoby Brissett, and Bailey Zappe.\n\nWhen discussing the decision on The Adam Schefter Podcast, Wolf told the ESPN insider Milton's raw ability was too impressive to ignore at that stage of the event.\n\nI had the opportunity to watch Joe play live... just watching him throw the football is unbelievable... we feel like there's some things that we can work with and develop. It was just one of those picks where there was too much talent in him to pass that up.\n\nWolf pointed to Milton's \"rocket for an arm\" and athleticism as intriguing traits for the young passer. Milton spent only one of his six collegiate seasons as a full-time starter, but posted some impressive numbers during his final two years as a Volunteer, completing 64.7% of his passes for 3,784 yards and 30 touchdowns with just five interceptions. He also ran for 376 yards and seven scores in that time.\n\nRelated Patriots' Veteran QB 'Excited' To Compete for QB1 Job Veteran NFL QB Jacoby Brissett is ready to compete for the starting position in his second stint with the New England Patriots. Will Milton Be A Better Pro Than Maye? Recent two-QB drafts could indicate as much\n\nSchefter followed Wolf's comments with a story about longtime NFL offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton telling him he believed Milton could be the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft. While Milton never quite morphed into that level of player with the Volunteers, there is still immense potential oozing from his 6'5\", 235-pound frame.\n\nWolf -- who Schefter labeled New England's de facto GM despite the team beginning a search for one in recent days -- pointed to his staff's history of QB development as a reason for confidence in not only Milton's selection, but Maye's as well.\n\nBen McAdoo [and] Alex Van Pelt... they learned from Mike McCarthy. I think [he's] a great quarterback developer. They have the QB school stuff they did with [him]... they're going to implement that stuff for these guys. We'll see what they can do with them. Having worked with those guys before made it easier and [made us] more confident to be able to take a raw guy like Joe.\n\nIncluding the 2024 draft, there have only been four instances of teams taking multiple quarterbacks in the same draft class across the past two decades. Oddly enough, the lower-level prospect has enjoyed a more fruitful career than the higher-end choice twice, with the earlier selections not having much long-term success at all.\n\nMultiple QBs in

Tom Brady and Bill Belichick oversaw a dynasty that included six Super Bowl championships in 18 seasons. But, as the old adage goes, nothing lasts forever. Brady left in 2020 and Belichick lasted just three more seasons in Foxborough before leaving as head coach. The Patriots thought they found a successor for Brady in Mac Jones, but they reset the franchise this offseason by hiring Jerod Mayo as the head coach and drafting Drake Maye with the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nMaye has a lot of work to do, but selecting him is a good step in the right direction as New England looks to climb back to teh top of the NFL mountain. The Patriots made several other key additions in the draft, so let's look at their best moves from the three-day event.\n\nNo one truly knew what the Patriots were going to do. This team has a ton of holes on its roster, which made them a popular candidate for a trade back to recoup extra draft capital. But it isn't often that a quarterback of the future can fall right into a team's lap. That was the case with Maye and the Patriots. The opportunity was too good to pass up, and rightfully so.\n\nMaye was prolific for the North Carolina Tar Heels. In two seasons as the starter in Chapel Hill, he completed roughly 65% of his passes and averaged about 8.4 yards per attempt. He wound up totaling 7,929 yards and 62 touchdowns to just 16 interceptions. Maye also ran for 1,149 yards on the ground and scored 16 touchdowns with his legs. There's a reason why he has garnered comparisons to Josh Allen.\n\nHowever, it isn't a sure thing that Maye begins his career as a starter. The Patriots' skill position group, though that unit got a boost during this year's draft, is still relatively light on talent. Their offensive line was one of the worst in the NFL last season. On top of that, Maye's footwork and mechanics have left some wondering if it would be best for him to sit and develop his skills.\n\nWith a veteran quarterback in Jacoby Brissett in place already, New England could follow this template. Or, they could throw Maye in the fire immediately. No one knows for sure what their plan is. It's a good issue for the Patriots to have to solve. That they're even in this position is a major win for them.\n\nNew England badly needed to find wide receivers in this draft. Their leading receiver a year ago was sixth-round rookie DeMario Douglas, who registered just 561 yards in 14 games. Douglas emerged as a solid player for the Patriots, but they really needed to add talent to this room, especially on the boundary.\n\nThey did that with Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker. Polk stepped up for the Washington Huskies in 2023 while Jalen McMillan battled injury throughout the year. He wound up totaling 69 receptions for 1,159 yards and nine touchdowns alongside Rome Odunze and Michael Penix Jr. last year. Polk doesn't do one thing exceptionally well, but can do a little bit of everything.\n\nJavon Baker is not someone to dismiss either. Baker began his career at Alabama but transferred due to the surplus of talent they had at wide receiver. He wound up going to UCF, where he put up some big numbers. Baker put up 1,935 yards and 12 touchdowns on 108 receptions in two seasons with the Knights.\n\nHis advanced numbers would suggest that he's just as good or even better than players like Xavier Legette and Keon Coleman, who went 32nd and 33rd overall, respectively. Baker went with the 110th pick. He still has to perform on the field, but early indications suggest that the Patriots got a steal with Baker in the fourth round.\n\nBoth Polk and Baker starting as rookies would not be a surprise. The Patriots need receivers who can play on the outside and these two can both do that. They were outstanding selections by New England.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shervon_fakhimi@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Shervon Fakhimi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Tar Heels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_McMillan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen McMillan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCF_Knights_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCF Knights football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3-best-moves-by-the-Patriots-in-the-2024-NFL-Draft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

What are we looking for here for you?' \" recalled Brown, the North Carolina coach. \"And he said, 'I want better footwork. I want a better presence in the pocket. I want someone to work with my throwing motion.'\n\n\"So he's the first one to be overly critical of himself. And that's something that he always does.\"\n\nMaye's Patriots career officially begins this weekend when he hits the practice field for the first time at the team's rookie minicamp. And of the 8,000 things Maye needs to learn this summer -- the playbook, the protections, new receivers, NFL defenses, where to live, the best lobster roll -- improving his footwork is at the top of the list.\n\nMaye's footwork probably was the reason he was the third quarterback drafted last month after Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels. ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky called Maye's footwork \"sloppy\" and worried that he will struggle if he has to play too soon in his rookie year. The Athletic draft analyst Dane Brugler said Maye needs to correct bad habits like \"excessive bouncing on his feet or fading away from throws.\"\n\nBill Belichick said while breaking down Maye's highlights on the Pat McAfee draft show that \"his footwork needs a lot of work. You can see here he's just all over the place -- never resets his feet, never really gets in position to throw, gets strip-sacked. Too much hopping around. Step up and throw.\"\n\nImproving Maye's footwork was one reason North Carolina hired Chip Linsley last summer as offensive coordinator, to transition away from the backpedal drop to more three-step drops. Brown also hired two former NFL coaches to work with Maye -- former Browns head coach Freddie Kitchens, who coached Baker Mayfield and Carson Palmer in the NFL, and longtime quarterback coach Clyde Christensen, who coached Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck in Indianapolis and Tom Brady in Tampa Bay.\n\nChristensen, 68, called Maye \"a special kid.\"\n\n\"The footwork's a little bit rogue, but he'll reel that in,\" Christensen said. \"I think that getting into the pro system, and just doing it full-time without any other distractions, that you'll see a big jump in his game, just in his footwork and some of the things people have been critical of, which probably I don't agree with.\"\n\nChristensen couldn't work directly with Maye last fall because of his role as an \"analyst\" and not an official member of the coaching staff. But since the season ended, Maye has done on-field work with Christensen, Linsley, and Kitchens in Chapel Hill, while also throwing with longtime NFL quarterback Philip Rivers in Alabama.\n\nUNC's offense mostly operated out of the shotgun, and Maye's coaches are now getting him ready for the NFL.\n\n\"We'll continue working on footwork, we'll continue working on getting out from underneath center,\" Christensen said. \"And then I think slowly but surely, I think the next big thing for him will be protections. You've been in college where everything's tempo, and you don't have to adjust or manipulate the protections as much.\"\n\nChristensen is also trying to teach Maye to throw more with his body.\n\n\"We've been working and talking a lot about he uses his arm more than he does his body,\" Christensen said. \"We've always tried to incorporate that it really is a full-body sequence of events and starts from the ground up.\n\n\"And I think the more he learns that, the more consistently accurate he's going to be and the more consistent the ball is going to come off his arm.\"\n\nIn Foxborough, Maye will work with new Patriots offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, a former NFL quarterback who has coached Aaron Rodgers, Joe Burrow, and Mayfield. Maye also will be coached by new quarterbacks coach T.C. McCartney, a former college quarterback and NFL quarterbacks coach, and senior assistant Ben McAdoo, who worked with Rodgers and Eli Manning.\n\nPatriots de facto general manager Eliot Wolf said this week on Adam Schefter's podcast that his coaches are going to use the same \"quarterback school\" method that they learned from Mike McCarthy when they were all with the Packers.\n\nThe Patriots acknowledge that Maye's footwork needs improvement, but believe the issues are correctable. If anyone offers proof it can be fixed, it's Josh Allen, Maye's favorite comp, who completed 53 percent of his passes as a rookie, followed by 59 percent and 69 percent his next two seasons.\n\n\"Talking through some of the development that he needed, some of the things [the coaches] thought they could tighten up or fix in some cases, and at the end of the day, we felt comfortable with those things and really betting on the talent and the kid,\" said Wolf.\n\n\"Drake is a relentless worker from all the indications that we have, and he's going to be able to overcome some of the things in the areas that he needs to improve.\"\n\nMaye's UNC coaches believe he will be a sponge in New England, and pointed out how young he is compared with some other draft prospects. While Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix, and Michael Penix are 23-24 years old with five or six years of college experience, Maye is only 21 and played just two years at UNC. Plus, Maye lost his senior season of high school in 2020 to the pandemic.\n\n\"Just a puppy,\" Brown said. \"I mean, he's got a lot of growth out there. I coached Troy Aikman, and he struggled as a rookie and won a Super Bowl. I'm great friends with Peyton Manning. And he struggled as a rookie and won a Super Bowl.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Scheduled to kick off on May 10 and continue to May 11, this event will gather the Patriots' draft picks and undrafted free agents recently signed by the team. Additionally, several other prospects have been invited to participate in the rookie minicamp, offering them a chance to showcase their skills and potentially earn a roster spot with the Patriots as they progress toward the mandatory minicamp in June.\n\nOf course, Patriots fans and the football world are excited to see the No. 3 overall pick, quarterback Drake Maye, for the first time at a Patriots facility for football activities. But there is also excitement surrounding new offensive weapons, such as second-round draft pick Ja'Lynn Polk and fourth-round selection Javon Baker.\n\nBaker has made headlines since the draft with some eye-catching quotes and soundbites, and there is a good chance we could be in for more of them during this upcoming camp. New Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo continues to mold the franchise into his own shape, and a significant change will be the media access he is granting to the Patriots' rookie minicamp. This will provide a look behind the scenes that the media has never experienced during a rookie minicamp in Foxborough.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Mike Reiss, the New England Patriots will grant media access when rookie minicamp commences on May 11. This marks a shift from Bill Belichick's leadership's typically closed-door approach.\n\nBelichick had historically kept rookie minicamps off-limits to reporters, aligning with his broader philosophy of limiting media access. His rationale, articulated during a training camp session in July 2017, highlights concerns about premature judgments based on early practices, which may not accurately reflect a player's true abilities, positively or negatively. Belichick sounded off on the matter to reporters.\n\n\"You know, you guys are asking a lot of questions about what have we seen from 'this' guy, what are we seeing from 'that' guy. We've yet to put on pads, alright?\" Belichick said to reporters. \"I understand that this is a pretty talented group of evaluators in this room, but in all honesty, our evaluations come more in training camp when we actually practice, and we can fully execute the techniques and the plays that we're trying to do.\"\n\nBut with Mayo granting media access and the excitement surrounding an entirely new coaching staff and the newest offensive weapons, it's hard to imagine we won't hear about some way too early evaluations regarding these rookies.\n\nDrake Maye, the newly minted quarterback for the New England Patriots, expressed his anticipation for the forthcoming rookie minicamp, signaling a transition from the exhaustive draft process to acclimating to his new team.\n\nWith visits, pro days, and pre-draft interviews now in the rearview mirror, Maye's primary focus shifts towards integrating into the Patriots' system and preparing for his inaugural NFL campaign. When queried about areas for improvement on a recent segment of 98.5 The Sports Hub's Zolak and Bertrand, Maye acknowledged the need for refinement in certain aspects of his game. Also, he commented on his excitement about getting going.\n\n\"I'm pumped. I'm pumped. We get in on Thursday, so I'm super excited to get with the guys...That's kinda one of the best parts about coming to a new team is getting acclimated with the guys\", said Maye.\n\nAfter the excitement of getting to a new city and settling in at the facilities wears off, Maye is fully aware that he needs to get straight to work as he has an entirely new offensive system to learn with a new coaching staff. \"The biggest thing is being detailed with coach Van Pelt's offense, knowing all the details first,\" said the rookie. \"I think going out there like a deer in the headlights as a rookie is not smart. So, really fine-tuning that and really studying it, getting to know it, and being able to teach it back to somebody.\n\n\"That's kind of how I learn things,\" Maye added. \"Being able to teach it back to somebody is when I really feel like you know it. So, grind that, get really detailed in the playbook, all the motions, all the little stuff.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_lynch@heavy.com", "name": "Colin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mini-camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ-FM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WBZ-FM"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1450232851.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 147, "textEnd": 153}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 176, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 1755, "textEnd": 1764}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

However, according to the Boston Herald's Andrew Callahan, there is a chance those plans could change.\n\nCallahan laid out a way in which Patriots No. 3 overall pick Drake Maye could outplay Brissett this Summer and earn the starting job. And apparently, many in the building on the Patriots staff believe that is possible.\n\nMaye must make significant improvements to be ready to start week 1 of the NFL season for the Patriots. He's also going to face strict competition from Brissett, who has played some excellent football when he's been given consistent starts. However, the roster and coaching staff that plagued Mac Jones are gone, and both quarterbacks will have the weapons around them to help them excel.\n\nWhoever secures the starting quarterback position will be the first under new head coach Jerod Mayo. While the organization as a whole is known to be in a rebuilding phase, Mayo will want to compete on the field immediately, and that means starting whichever quarterback gives the Patriots the best chance to win.\n\nJacoby Brissett, the 31-year-old quarterback, arrives following a one-year tenure with the Washington Commanders, where he played in three games. Initially drafted by the Patriots in the third round of the 2016 NFL Draft, Brissett's journey has seen him play for five teams over eight seasons in the league.\n\nHis most notable season came in 2019 with the Colts, where he amassed 2,942 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions across 15 starts, showcasing his potential as a seasoned veteran. Brissett also threw for 3,000 yards in 2017, finishing with 13 touchdowns to just 7 interceptions. And make no mistake about it, Brissett is ready to compete for the starting role.\n\nI think it's going to be good,\" Brissett said via ESPN. \"I'm excited to have him on the team (Maye) and the other guys as well that we drafted and picked up. I think it's gonna be good. Competition brings out the best in all of us, so I'm excited about that part.\"\n\nEveryone is excited about quarterback Drake Maye's promising future, but that doesn't mean he is 100% NFL-ready as a rookie. The young quarterback must improve some areas of his game before being handed the keys to an NFL organization.\n\nIronically enough, former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick joined \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on draft night and broke down Maye's college tape to point out where he needs significant improvement.\n\nBelichick emphasized the quarterback position as a top priority for the Patriots, acknowledging Maye's potential as a \"very talented kid\" boasting good size and arm strength. However, he expressed reservations regarding Maye's tendency to rely heavily on his mobility, suggesting it could be a concern. Additionally, Belichick highlighted Maye's limited experience, having only completed two full seasons at North Carolina after a redshirt first season.\n\nFootwork emerged as a particular area of critique for Belichick during the pre-draft evaluation process, echoing concerns raised by scouts and analysts in the lead-up to the draft. Despite Maye's promising attributes, Belichick underscored the need for refinement and development to thrive at the NFL level.\n\nWhile breaking down the film, Belichick discusses how quick Maye is to come off receivers during his progressions and points out that the passing windows in the NFL are significantly tighter than in the college ranks.\n\nIt will be exciting for Patriots fans to watch Maye this Summer and see if he can make the necessary adjustments and improvements to force the coaching staff's hand as he competes to earn the QB1 role.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_lynch@heavy.com", "name": "Colin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1802698463.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

He's tough. He's gritty. He was productive. He elevated those around him. He's 6-foot-4 1/2 and 225 pounds. He can really throw the ball. He's athletic. I think it's a combination of those things.

But where does Maye feel that he needs to improve the most?:\n\n\"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is being detailed. Knowing all the new terminology with Coach [Alex} Van Pelt's offense, knowing all the details first. I think going out there like a deer in the headlights as a rookie is not smart. So, fine tuning that and really get to study it and get to know it and be able to teach it back to somebody, that's kind of how I learn things, be able to teach it back to somebody until you know it. So, you know, you'll grind that and get really detailed in the playbook and the formations, all the motions, all the little stuff. And, you know, like I said, working on my cadence and under center and using that as a weapon. I think that's a big thing in the NFL using cadence. You go under center a lot in the red zone in college. But like I said, not as much in the open field. Just getting used to that. But, like I said my game translates pretty well to the NFL.

With the third overall pick in the first round, North Carolina's Drake Maye was brought aboard in hopes of stabilizing the most important position on the field.\n\nBut even with Maye added to the mix and holes across the roster, the Patriots were not done at quarterback. They selected another prospect on Day 3 of the draft: Tennessee's Joe Milton was picked 193rd overall.\n\nWhy did New England go after two quarterbacks, though? According to director of scouting Eliot Wolf, who had final say in the draft room, Milton's talent was too enticing to pass up at this point in the draft.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to watch Joe play live, the last game of the year against Vanderbilt,\" Wolf said during a recent appearance on the Adam Schefter Podcast.\n\n\"I got there really early and watched him warm up, and just watching him throw the football is unbelievable. He's 6-5, 245 pounds. He's got a rocket for an arm. He's athletic. He played in [Josh] Heupel's offense there, which is not an NFL offense, but we feel like there's some things that we can work with and develop. It was just one of those picks where there was too much talent in him to pass that up.\"\n\nThe game against Vanderbilt was arguably the best performances of Milton's college career. Completing 22 of 32 pass attempts, he finished with 383 passing yards and four touchdowns. He also scored another two TDs on his five rushing attempts.\n\nThat outing alone does not tell the whole story of Milton's six-year college career, which saw him struggle with consistency in his 21 total starts between Michigan and Tennessee. It did, however, show the talent and high ceiling he does possess.\n\nThe Patriots were obviously drawn to that late in the draft, but they also felt confident in their ability to develop both Milton and Drake Maye.\n\n\"Having worked with Ben McAdoo and Alex Van Pelt before, and they learned from Mike McCarthy -- I think Mike McCarthy is a great quarterback developer -- they have the quarterback school stuff that they did with McCarthy,\" Wolf exaplined. \"T.C. McCartney is our quarterback coach, they will sort of implement that stuff for these guys and we'll see what they can do with them.\n\n\"But having worked with those guys before made it easier and organizationally more confident to be able to take a raw guy like Joe.\"", "source": {"uri": "patspulpit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pats Pulpit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bernd_buchmasser@patspulpit.com", "name": "Bernd Buchmasser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Wolf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eliot Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_Commodores_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt Commodores football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_McAdoo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben McAdoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSmQ29oHiTdxwzJqLI-tUo9YiQ0=/0x118:4057x2147/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25438439/1748977856.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544659", "eventUri": "eng-9544659", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

So why did they take a second quarterback two days later?\n\nAccording to Eliot Wolf, there was simply too much talent to pass up.\n\nThe Patriots' de facto general manager appeared on \"The Adam Schefter Podcast\" this week and discussed the team's moves so far this offseason.\n\nThere was little surprise when the team took North Carolina's Drake Maye No. 3 overall. However, there was a bit of buzz when New England took Tennessee quarterback Joe Milton in the sixth round.\n\nSo what did the Patriots see in Milton that made it worth double-dipping at quarterback?\n\n\"It was just one of those picks where there was too much talent in him to pass that up,\" Wolf said.\n\nMilton and Maye now enter a crowded quarterback room that features newly signed veteran Jacoby Brissett along with the returning Bailey Zappe.\n\nWolf said that the team was confident in taking a raw quarterback like Milton because of the support system the organization has. In particular, Wolf highlighted quarterbacks coach T.C. McCartney, offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt and senior offensive assistant Ben McAdoo as coaches who can help develop talent.\n\nAnd Wolf made it clear: He sees a whole lot of talent in Milton.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to watch Joe play live, the last game of the year against Vanderbilt.

However, Wolf stressed that the presence of Brissett will allow New England to take its time before putting those quarterbacks on the field.\n\n\"We've spent time with Drake and Joe. But we haven't had a work day with them yet. They'll get in here next week. We'll gauge where they're at.

The Patriots, who are moving into a totally new era with former Vol Jerod Mayo as head coach, also took North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye with the third overall selection.\n\nVeteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett is also on the roster.\n\nFor Milton, it's a nice landing spot with a potential path forward as a backup over the next couple of seasons. You kind of got the feeling that a few teams would fall in love with Milton's physical tools, which are undeniable.\n\nThat team turned out to be the Patriots, and it sounds like their acting decision-maker Eliot Wolf was sold after watching him live.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to watch Joe play live the last game of the year against Vanderbilt, and you know I got there really early and watched him warm up... Just watching him throw the football is unbelievable,\" Wolf said on The Adam Schefter Podcast. \"You know, 6-5, 245 pounds, he's got a rocket for an arm, he's athletic. He played in Heupel's offense there, which is not an NFL offense. But we feel like there are some things there that we can work with and develop.\n\n\"It was one of those picks where, you know, there was too much talent in him to pass that up.\"\n\nWolf pointed to offensive assistants Ben McAdoo and Alex Van Pelt as reasons for confidence when selecting a developmental guy like Milton -- and Drake Maye also.\n\nThat game against Vanderbilt was Milton's best of the year by far. Playing on senior day, Milton was lights out all night long. He ended up going 22/33 passing, throwing for 383 yards and four touchdowns. He added two rushing touchdowns as well, leading Tennessee to a 48-24 win over the Commodores.\n\nIt was a performance we had all kind of been waiting for, and a 2-9 Vanderbilt team was the perfect place to get it. Overall, Milton just never really put all the puzzle pieces together in 2023. He ended up throwing for 2,813 yards and 20 touchdowns, but the passing attack took a large step back from the 2022 season with Hendon Hooker.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect was the lack of a downfield passing game, despite Milton's cannon arm. He averaged 7.9 yards per pass attempt (48th overall), down from the 9.5 yards per attempt from Hooker in 2022 (1st overall).\n\nMilton now enters a true pro-style offense, which is a large departure from Heupel's attack as Wolf pointed out. He'll be one of the more fascinating prospects in all of the NFL to watch during the preseason, which is set to begin in August.\n\nLet's hope the Patriots give him the freedom to uncork a few -- he should see plenty of work.", "source": {"uri": "rockytoptalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rocky Top Talk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terry_a_lambert@rockytoptalk.com", "name": "Terry A.

With seven individual titles already this year, India's 21-member contingent - their largest in the history of the event - is set to embark on the World Badminton Championships that gets underway on Monday, with a hope that this upward climb can snap India's wait for a gold medal at the premier event.\n\nThere is every reason to believe. For we are eight months into this year, and the thrust provided by PV Sindhu's historic silver at the Olympics last year has culminated into Indian shuttlers winning seven individual titles. The glaring feats of Kidambi Srikanth, B Sai Praneeth and Sindhu ensured that India became one of the few countries to have filled in all eight qualification spots - four men's and women's respectively.\n\nTOI Sports takes a look at the eight individual shuttlers and their draws at the mega event.\n\nKidambi Srikanth\n\nThree years removed from defeating Olympic Champion Lin Dan in 2014 China Open Super Series, Kidambi Srikanth is on his way to becoming the face of Indian men's badminton and is a front-runner to reign supreme. No shuttler has made quite the kind of noise like Srikanth has. He showed signs of what he was capable of during the Olympics, when he went down fighting to Dan in the quarters. As it turned out, it was just a blueprint for the greater things he would go on to achieve.\n\nSrikanth won the 2017 Indonesia Super Series Premier beating Japan's Kazumasa Sakai 21-11, 21-19, becoming the first Indian to do so. Next month he bagged the 2017 Australian Open Super Series getting the better of China's Chen Long 22-20, 21-16. With that, he headlined three Super Series finals in a row which remains a record for an Indian shuttler. A testament to his stellar form can be gauged by the fact that he started 2017 as World No. 15 and now enters the World Championships ranked eighth.\n\nDRAW: Srikanth will open his campaign against Sergey Sirant of Russia. Next up, he would be up against either the world No. 45 Lin Yu Hsien or world No. 63 Lucas Corvee. In the third round, Srikanth awaits either Tommy Sugiarto or 14th seed Anders Antonsen. Provided he makes it to the final eight, Srikanth will face a familiar opponent in Son Wah Ho, whom he has beaten in their last two SuperSeries encounters.\n\nB Sai Praneeth\n\nWith Srikanth, Sai Praneeth created history when the two headlined the Singapore Open Super Series final; quite the moment considering how the two grew up learning badminton in the same city from the same coach. He eventually went on to defeat Srikanth for his maiden Super Series title and with it, began taking baby steps towards Badminton's grandest stage. Six weeks after winning the Singapore Open Super Series, the 25-year-old clinched his first Grand Prix Gold title clinching the $120,000 Thailand Open with a hard fought 17-21, 21-18, 21-19 victory against Christie Jonatan of Indonesia. Between April and June, Praneeth escalated 14 places in the BWF rankings.\n\nDRAW: Praneeth opens his campaign against World No. 44 Wei Nan and awaits Anthony Sinisuka Ginting in the second round. If and when he goes past these obstacles, he will encounter World No. 6 Chou Tien Chen in Round 3, easily his toughest contest of the three. Provided Praneeth gets past Chen, it's either Ng Ka Long Angus or Viktor Axelsen, who Praneeth will face to make it to the final four.\n\nAjay Jayaram\n\nWhile he may lay behind compatriots Srikanth and Praneeth in terms of having titles to show, Ajay Jayaram has beaten the likes of Denmark's Viktor Axelsen (Malaysian Open Super Series) and China's Tian Houwei (Badminton Asia Championships) despite enduring a relatively quiet season. Placed in the singles draw among a heavyweight opponent in China's Cheng Long (world No.5), Jayaram is working himself back to fitness and form, at the peak of which he won back-to-back Dutch Open titles. Jayaram recently said that his aim is to break into the Top-10. Well, what bigger stage than the World Championships for resurgence?\n\nDRAW: Jayaram should have an unnerving first two rounds - against World No. 114 Luka Wraber and someone between World No. 51 Mark Caljouw and No. 70 Niluka Karunaratnein the second. But Round 3 is where he runs into his gravest challenge - fifth seed Chen Long, whom Jayaram is yet to beat. If Jayaram registers his first win against him, another Chinese, Lee Chong Wei awaits him in the quarter-final.\n\nSameer Verma\n\nIn May, Sameer Verma had missed the qualification for the World Championships. Stellar performances by Srikanth and Praneeth had helped them attain a better ranking and all doors were shut on Verma. But the exclusion of Chinese Taipei players from the tournament opened up a number of slots and Verma received a fresh lease of life. But come August 21, it'd be easier said than done for him.\n\nIn January, the 22-year-old clinched his maiden Grand Prix Gold title at Syed Modi International and followed it with a quarter-final finish at the India Super Series. But then Verma suffered a shoulder injury during one of his training sessions which forced him to withdraw from Indonesia and Australian Open Superseries events in June. However, at such a huge event, he would want to start afresh.\n\nDRAW: Verma has been drawn against veteran shuttler Pablo Abian of Spain. Provided he wins, he will lock horns with another experienced shuttler in England's Rajiv Ouseph. If that isn't it, next is Lin Dan. Not an easy road ahead.\n\nPV Sindhu\n\nIndia have managed to win a medal at the World Championships since 2011, and it was PV Sindhu, who brought home India's first medal by a female shuttler at the event by winning won a bronze in 2013 and following it with another bronze the year after. But a lot has changed in four years. Her historic silver at Rio Olympics has raised the bar not only for Indian badminton but for Sindhu herself. Hopes would be pinned on Sindhu, the highest-seeded Indian in the tournament - to bring home its maiden World Championships gold medal. And she has the form to do so.\n\nSindhu started 2017 by winning the Syed Modi International series title by beating Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska. In April, she defeated Olympic champion Carolina Marin 21-19, 21-16 to win the India Open SuperSeries for the first time and days later, rose to a career-high No 2 in the BWF women's singles rankings.\n\nDRAW: Seeded fourth, Sindhu will either face South Korean Kim Hyo Min or Hadia Hosny of Egypt in the second round. If she gets through, she would be in for a stiff task in the quarter-finals in the form of Chinese fifth seed Sun Yu.\n\nSaina Nehwal\n\nFor Indian badminton's original superstar Saina Nehwal, the World Championships will pose a bigger challenge than ever. Ever since winning silver at the same event two years ago, Saina has been struggling with form. Then there is that troubled knee that gave up during the Olympics and she exited in a rather ill-fated manner. Saina won the Malaysia Masters in January, which was her first title after returning from the injury, but despite it, she has not been able to reach her peak.\n\nThe good news though is that according to Saina's coach Vimal Kumar, she is positive, training well and is looking forward to claiming the top-spot. But it won't be easy considering the opponents she'll come face-to-face with during the event.\n\nDRAW: Saina received a bye in the first round and may face Ji Hyun Sung of Korea in the third round. Sung is seeded second but has a very poor record against Saina. In fact, Saina thrashed Sung at the Australian Open in June. If she gets past Sung, Saina may face He Bingjiao of China - whom she's yet to encounter on the circuit - in the quarterfinals.\n\nRituparna Das and Tanvi Lad\n\nRituparna Das and Tanvi Lad, ranked 46th and 93rd respectively, may be relatively green at the international level, but they both have been around. In February this year, Rituparna went from being a two-time runner up at the Senior National Badminton Championships to lifting the trophy, by defeating defeated Reshma Karthik in straight games. She played her first maiden Superseries event but lost in the round of 16 to Carolina Marin at the Indian Open.\n\nDRAW: Having earned direct entry in the tournament, Rituparna and Lad will face Finnish Airi Mikkela and England's Chloe Birch in their first round matches respectively.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T09:03:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 4809, "textStart": 4800, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-21", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375045", "time": "09:03:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375045", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "47", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "100", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "113", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "121", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "158", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "191", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "199", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "218", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "52726", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "242110", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "308652", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "score": 5}, {"id": "323778", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India", "score": 5}, {"id": "323839", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Badminton World Federation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_World_Federation", "score": 3}, {"id": "324139", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Saina Nehwal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saina_Nehwal", "score": 2}, {"id": "390450", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Carolina Mar\u00edn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Mar\u00edn", "score": 2}, {"id": "397411", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jayaram"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayaram", "score": 5}, {"id": "398509", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Lin Dan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Dan", "score": 4}, {"id": "402579", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Lee Chong Wei"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Chong_Wei", "score": 2}, {"id": "412023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Badminton Asia Championships"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_Asia_Championships", "score": 3}, {"id": "412025", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chen Long"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Long", "score": 4}, {"id": "424932", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pablo Abi\u00e1n"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Abi\u00e1n", "score": 2}, {"id": "496229", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Ouseph"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Ouseph", "score": 2}, {"id": "607235", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tommy Sugiarto"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Sugiarto", "score": 3}, {"id": "622389", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "U.

He defeated two-time Olympic champion China's Lin 'Super' Dan in straight games to win his maiden Superseries event, the China Open.\n\nKidambi Srikanth beat reigning world champion Chen Long to win Australia Open Superseries title. Twitter @BAI_Media\n\nHowever, Srikanth remained an enigma in the years between 2014 -2017.\n\nHe constantly scuttled in and out of the top 20, with the China Open victory giving him his first entry into the top 10 and he also qualified for the year-ending BWF Superseries Masters, where he bowed out in the semi-final.\n\nThe year 2015 saw him winning a Grand Prix gold event and yet another Superseries event, while staying in the top 10 for the entire year, even breaching into the top 3.\n\nThough, he reached the quarter-final of the Rio Olympics where he lost to Lin Dan and won the Syed Modi International Grand Prix Gold event, he fell out of the top 10 for the first time in a year.\n\nWith PV Sindhu's silver medal at the Rio Olympics, the focus entirely shifted on to the women's singles and Kidambi Srikanth along with the men's singles was relegated to the periphery.\n\nAn ankle injury after his quarter-final exit at Rio 2016 saw him miss the end of last season.\n\nThen 2017 happened.\n\nThe year of Kidambi\n\nThe first three months of the year played out like his previous years and although he started the year as World No 15, he was out of the top-30 for the first time in almost three years in March.\n\nThe script was all too familiar and it felt the law of averages caught up and stuck to him firmly.\n\nBut, then in April 2017, there was a change of fortunes.\n\nKidambi Srikanth reached the finals of the Singapore Open Superseries defeating higher-ranked Shi Yuqi from China.\n\nFor the first time in a ranked event, two Indian players faced off in the summit clash where B Sai Praneeth prevailed in a three game encounter.\n\nHowever, this was the start of the rise and rise of the Hyderabad-based shuttler from the Pullela Gopichand Academy.\n\nIn the Indonesia Open Superseries premier in June, he beat World No 1 Son Wan Ho on his way to lifting his first BWF title in more than a year.\n\nHe was now World No 11.\n\nIn the Australian Open Superseries that followed in the span of two weeks, Kidambi met 2016 Olympic champion Chen Long in the final. The Chinese shuttler had never lost to Kidambi in five previous attempts.\n\nBut 2017 has been the year of Kidambi who rewrote history with every consecutive tournament. He became the first Indian and only the sixth player ever to feature in three consecutive Superseries event finals.\n\nKidambi beat Chen Long 22-20, 21-16 to become the second most successful Indian after Saina Nehwal at Superseries events.\n\nThe win put him right back into the top 10 and he now enters his third World Championship as World No 8.\n\nThe 24-year-old's run this year has also propelled him to the top of the overall prize money standings. His haul of $147,847.50 is more than double the earnings of second-placed Lee Chong Wei.\n\nKidambi Srikanth is seen as the torch-bearer of Indian men's singles shuttlers who have ruled the roost this year. The performance of the Indians has posed tough questions to the Chinese domination in the sport.\n\nIndia has seven shuttlers in the top 50, one more than China and two more than Denmark.\n\nWorld Championships\n\nSince Prakash Padukone's bronze medal in 1983, India never had a men's medal winner at the World Championships. In the tournament starting on 21 August in Glasgow, India is fielding Ajay Jayaram, B Sai Praneeth and Sameer Verma along with Kidambi Srikanth in the men's singles event.\n\nSrikanth, who has been handed a comparatively easier draw among the four, will start his World Badminton Championships campaign against Russia's Sergey Sirant.\n\nHaving never gone past the third round in two previous attempts, Kidambi, who has recently developed a knack of breaking records, would like to add this to his recent successful run.\n\nWith the Indonesian coach Mulyo Handoyo proving to be a game-changer for Kidambi, the reticent shuttler has developed a confident net-game and an all-round attacking style of play.\n\nWith India going with a 21-member contingent, its largest ever, to the World Championships, the in-form Kidambi, who is on a 10-match winning streak, might just be India's brightest medal prospect.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 20, 2017 09:10 am | Updated Date: Aug 20, 2017 09:18

PTI\n\nIn a very short span of time, the Hyderabad-born shuttler proved that he is not one to be taken lightly. That said, he is no stranger to success. Despite having a slow start to the 2017 Badminton World Federation (BWF) season, Praneeth hit the ground running with back-to-back titles at the Singapore Open Superseries and Thailand Open. A lot was changed in terms of his style of play and the way he approached the match against some of the best men's singles shuttlers. When he takes the court, he oozes fearlessness and can topple any opponent on his day, which was evident when he got the better of compatriot Srikanth Kidambi in the final of the Singapore Open earlier in May.\n\nSuch was the 25-year-old's form between mid-April to May that it allowed him to emerge as one of the serious contenders to claim the World Championships title in Glasgow, Scotland. A 2010 World Junior bronze medallist, Praneeth, has dished out some explosive performances in 2017 so far, but the baby-faced assassin has something else to boast about.\n\nIn his upward trajectory, what makes him even more dangerous is his ability to upset big names. The 23-year-old shuttler does not succumb to pressure and has a knack of surprising higher-ranked players with his attacking forecourt movements. In 2013, the former All England Champion Muhammad Hafiz Hashim of Malaysia was floored by an unseeded Praneeth, who fought back from a game down to win the match dramatically in the first round of the Thailand Open.\n\nJust weeks after that iconic win, he gatecrashed former World and Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat's final international appearance in front of his home crowd in the opening round of the 2013 Indonesia Open. He continued his courageous show in the Hong Kong Superseries by upsetting crowd favourite Hu Yun just days after the Thailand tie. The victory over Srikanth helped extend his giant-killing ways.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is arguably the best phase of Praneeth's career and also for Indian badminton. However, things will be a lot different, and even more competitive, at the Championships in Glasgow, where Praneeth -- who has bagged the 15th seeding -- has been pitted against Hong Kong veteran Wei Nan, who was handed a last-minute direct entry.\n\nA win over Nan would see Praneeth square off against Anthony Sinisuka Ginting of Indonesia. Praneeth trails 0-1 in the overall head-to-head meeting(s) against the lanky Indonesian, having lost to him in three tough games in 2016 Thomas Cup finals. If he manages to take Ginting down, sixth-seeded Chinese Taipei ace, Chou Tien Chen awaits him in the third round.\n\nIn a recent interview with PTI, the Hyderabadi shuttler said he has set his eyes on the Dubai Superseries Final in December and hopes to crack the top 10 in the coming months.\n\n\"This year, my aim is to play Superseries Final in Dubai. If I play that then automatically, it would mean my ranking goes up. So I want to give some good performances in Super Series so that I get an entry in Super Series final,\" said Praneeth, who won the Thailand Open and reached the finals at Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold in January.\n\n\"I am at No 10 in terms of Super Series ranking and above me, there are three Chinese players, out of which only two would be playing. There are six more Super Series events so let's see. I have a target of reaching the top 10 this year,\" he added.\n\nGlasgow will be a golden opportunity for the in-form shuttler to justify all the hype around his sudden rise and to further prove that Indian men's singles department has become a force to reckon with.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 01:00 pm | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 01:05 pm\n\nTags :#B sai praneeth#Badminton#Badminton world

It was expected to be a lopsided affair with the 2011 senior national champion winning her second title in three years.\n\nThe final score read 21-11, 21-17 in favour of Sindhu but the match was anything but a one-sided affair. The scoreline might not reflect on the performance of the young shuttler who impressed with her grit and talent.\n\nFile image of India's Rituparna Das. Image courtesy: Screengrab from BAI's Facebook page\n\nA lot was expected from the Haldia-born Rituparna, but her career has been marred by inconsistencies ever since then.\n\nThe under-13 champion in 2008 earned everyone's attention with her style of play including that of Pullela Gopichand who facilitated her move from West Bengal to train at his Hyderabad-based academy.\n\nHowever, things weren't going right for Rituparna whose biggest drawback was the tag of being lazy that got stuck to her since her Junior days. It is said that even Gopichand was miffed at the way she approached her career and found her too lazy to succeed at the highest level.\n\nThis approach also saw her fumbling in the finals of the various national and international tournaments.\n\nRituparna, who is considered to be the best shuttler in the second rung of players has also constantly struggled with her fitness.\n\nIn 2016, things started looking bright for the 21-year-old who won a couple of Badminton World Federation(BWF) International Challenge/Series, the India International Series and the Polish International. These wins helped her gain important points that held her in good stead when it was time for World Championships qualification.\n\nEarlier this year, in February, Rituparna finally managed to get past the finish line -- She went from being a two-time runner up at the Senior National Badminton Championships to lifting the trophy, when the second seed defeated Reshma Karthik in straight sets.\n\nRituparna finally put an end to the claims of her being a talented but lethargic opponent to make improvements in her style and becoming a big-game player.\n\nIn 2017, Rituparna who started with a BWF rank of 63, also reached her highest rank of 44.\n\nHer best result in this year's international tournaments was the quarter-final appearance at the Syed Modi International Grand Prix Gold in January.\n\n2017 also saw Rituparna playing her first ever Superseries tournament at the India Open where she lost in the round of 16 to Olympic champion Carolina Marin.\n\nIn the tournaments that followed, she had first-round exits in the Singapore Open Superseries, Thailand Open Grand Prix Gold and Canada Open. In the recently concluded US Open, she progressed to the second round where she went down fighting to seventh seed Dane Natalia Rohde.\n\nApart from these events, she was also part of the Premier Badminton League, where she was a part of table toppers Awadhe Warriors.\n\nThis continued international exposure will do the World No 46 a whole lot of good when she takes on World No 54 Airi Mikkela at the World Championships.\n\nHaving already defeated the Finnish shuttler once in 2012, a repeat performance at the World Championships will see her locking horns with 16th seeded Scottish shuttler Kirsty Gilmour.\n\nFor Rituparna, the India No 2, it will not be easy to come out of the shadow of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, two of the most celebrated women shuttlers in India.\n\nA good run at the World Championships will be an opportunity to do so.\n\nWith the men's division of Indian badminton growing from strength to strength, the World Championships provides the women's division a opportunity and the stage to make themselves counted. Pressing the accelerator is the need of the hour and they will need to up the ante big time on the grandest of stages.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 05:33 pm | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 05:33 pm\n\nTags :#Awadhe warriors#Canada open#Carolina marin#India international series#India open#Kirsty gilmour#Polish international#Pullela gopichand#Pv sindhu#Reshma karthik#Rituparna das#Saina nehwal#Senior national badminton championships#Syed modi international gpg#Thailand open gpg#World badminton championships 2017", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T12:19:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 19, "textStart": 3, "date": "2013-12-23", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3877, "textStart": 3865, "date": "2017-08-16", "freq": 2, "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375045", "time": "12:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375045", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "37", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "51299", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "58156", "label": {"eng": "Haldia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haldia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haldia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "84296", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302866", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "score": 3}, {"id": "308652", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "score": 4}, {"id": "316851", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "323839", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Badminton World Federation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_World_Federation", "score": 3}, {"id": "324139", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Saina Nehwal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saina_Nehwal", "score": 2}, {"id": "390450", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Carolina Mar\u00edn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Mar\u00edn", "score": 2}, {"id": "398562", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Pullela Gopichand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullela_Gopichand", "score": 3}, {"id": "608560", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kirsty Gilmour"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsty_Gilmour", "score": 2}, {"id": "669457", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "BWF Super Series"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWF_Super_Series", "score": 3}, {"id": "1194999", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Thailand Open (badminton)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand_Open_(badminton)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1257658", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Awadhe Warriors"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awadhe_Warriors", "score": 2}, {"id": "1258333", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Singapore Open (badminton)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Open_(badminton)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1309036", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "BWF International Challenge"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWF_International_Challenge", "score": 3}, {"id": "1310429", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Premier Badminton League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Badminton_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "1353894", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Syed Modi International Badminton Championships"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Modi_International_Badminton_Championships", "score": 2}, {"id": "1362893", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Indian National Badminton Championships"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Badminton_Championships", "score": 2}], "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Creative-2.jpg", "timeCrawl": "12:19:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "World Badminton Championships 2017: Rituparna Das' chance to gain much-needed exposure and recognition", "originalArticle": null}

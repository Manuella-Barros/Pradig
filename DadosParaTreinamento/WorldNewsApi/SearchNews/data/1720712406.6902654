Despite enduring a difficult debut season in the Premier League at relegated Burnley, Trafford is viewed as one of the most highly-rated and promising shot-stoppers in the country. Trafford started 28 of Burnley\u2019s 38 league games last season but found himself on the sidelines for the other ten as Vincent Kompany, who recently moved to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, dropped him in favour of Arijanet Muric. Given Trafford\u2019s unconvincing campaign, it was somewhat of a surprise to see him named in England\u2019s provisional 33-man squad for Euro 2024 alongside fellow goalkeepers Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale and Dean Henderson. Trafford, who was an expected drop-out from the final 26-man squad, has represented England at various youth levels and helped the U21 side win the European Championships last year. The 21-year-old\u2019s performances for club and country have not gone unnoticed, with Chelsea and Newcastle readying moves for the goalkeeper ahead of the summer transfer window, which opens on Friday. Chelsea are expected to sign a new goalkeeper this summer and new manager Enzo Maresca is a fan of Trafford, who he worked with at Manchester City. Trafford, right, missed out on a place in England\u2019s Euros squad (Picture: Getty) Newcastle are also looking to bring a new shot-stopper to St James\u2019 Park and have turned their attentions to Trafford due to Arsenal\u2019s steep valuation of Ramsdale. Burnley know teams will try to pick off their top players following their relegation to the Championship but want at least \u00a330m to part ways with Trafford, according to The Sun. That means Newcastle will need to almost double their opening offer for the England U21 star, having seen a bid worth \u00a316m rejected by Burnley over the weekend. While Trafford was included in England\u2019s provisional Euros squad, he was always going to be left at home, with Pickford the undisputed No. 1 and Ramsdale set to deputise in Germany.

The Three Lions \u2013 who face Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia in the group stage \u2013 began the week by beating Bosnia and Herzegovina 3-0 at St James\u2019 Park. \u2018Across the two games we haven\u2019t had probably our full side out at any one point,\u2019 Southgate said. \u2018It has been strange preparation. \u2018We are having to get players off after an hour when you would really be pushing to try and turn the result around. \u2018It is not perfect but I have been involved in these last matches going into a tournament as a player and inevitably players have one eye on what is coming in terms of some of the early challenges. \u2018No excuses on the result, we have to be better than that but there are a lot of things we can put right pretty quickly. We didn\u2019t get our pressing right and we were too stretched without the ball. \u2018There were questions asked that we weren\u2019t able to answer. No matter how much talent you have with the ball, if your out of possession game isn\u2019t right then it can make it feel like you\u2019ve not got a foothold in the game. \u2018We will be ready. Obviously tonight hasn\u2019t gone as we hoped but I said to the players at the beginning of this 45-odd days we will spend together, not every day is going to go as we want it. Tonight is one of those but we need to stay very calm.\u2019 For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

{"id": 231297100, "title": "More young Canadians want homes and pets over marriage and kids, survey says", "text": "The recent survey found 61 per cent of Canadian Gen Z respondents would choose pets over children. \u201cAfter watching boomer generations and beyond stay cemented in the same place for decades, Gen Z is keen to adopt lifestyles that allow for greater flexibility and fewer long-term commitments,\u201d the report notes. A Statistics Canada report from 2023 found it costs about $293,000 to raise a child from birth to age 17 for a middle-family with two kids, amounting to an average of $17,235 per year. Meanwhile, a report from Rover found owning a dog could cost as much as $4,020 per year, though the expenses vary on the dog\u2019s breed, age and lifestyle. Statistia, on the other hand, estimates the average cost of owning a cat to be $2,800 per year. Houses over weddings? In decades past, Canadian couples could afford to have the home and wedding of their dreams, but nowadays more couples have to choose. The survey found 73 per cent of Canadians Gen Zs see homeownership as a primary life goal, though 61 per cent of respondents are unsure if they will be able to afford it. Meanwhile, 42 per cent of respondents believe marriage is an important life goal, while 41 per cent see it as necessary.", "summary": "61% of Gen Z respondents would choose pets over children", "url": "https://financialpost.com/personal-finance/young-canadians-homes-pets-over-marriage-kids", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/no0607dogs.jpg", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XbOTPVUW-SZnIQkEn.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:00:07", "author": "Ben Cousins", "authors": ["Ben Cousins"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.061}

Why is it significant for India-Maldives ties?\n\nJaishankar's three-day trip is the first high-level visit from India to the Maldives since Muizzu, who is thought to be pro-China, was sworn in as Maldives' president in November 2023.\n\nAs per The Print, Jaishankar is expected to meet President Muizzu and Maldivian Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer.\n\nSources told the outlet Muizzu could possibly visit India in September.\n\nMuizzu in June visited India for the swearing-in of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his third term.\n\nIt was Muizzu's first visit to the country since taking office.\n\n\"The visit follows the recent visit of the President of the Republic of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, to India for the swearing-in ceremony of the new Cabinet and Council of Ministers,\" the MEA statement read.\n\n\"The visit is aimed at strengthening the close partnership between the two countries and to explore avenues to enhance the bilateral relationship further,\" it added.\n\nZameer visited India in May, while Jaishankar previously visited the Maldives in January.\n\nJaishankar and Zameer also met in January in the Ugandan capital city of Kampala at the two-day summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).\n\nJaishankar said the two leaders had a \"frank conversation\" on ties between the two countries.\n\nWhy is it significant?\n\nBecause Maldives plays a critical role in New Delhi's 'Neighbourhood First' policy and our SAGAR Vision.\n\nAs per The Print, the country's location in the Indian Ocean is key to New Delhi maintaining its security in the region.\n\nTies between the two nations in the areas of defence and security had been on an upswing since the previous government in Male.\n\nIn May 2023, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh visited the Maldives during which he handed over a fast patrol vessel and a landing craft to the island nation.\n\nIn August last year, Prime Minister Modi and then Maldivian president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih kick-started the India-funded Greater Male connectivity project, billed as the largest infrastructure initiative in the island nation.\n\nUnder the Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP), a 6.74-kilometre bridge and causeway link will be built to connect the capital city Male with adjoining islands of Villingli, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi.\n\nBut ties have been strained between India and Maldives since Muizzu took power.\n\nMuizzu, widely seen as a pro-China leader, ran an 'India out' campaign against then Maldivian president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.\n\nMuizzu, a close associate of former Maldives President Abdulla Yameen who forged close ties with China during his Presidency from 2013 to 2018, defeated the India-friendly Solih in the presidential runoff held in September.\n\nMuizzu in his campaign had vowed to evict Indian military personnel from Maldives - a promise on which he followed through.\n\nIndia ended its decades-long military presence in the Maldives ahead of the May 10 deadline set by Muizzu.\n\nThe government, citing official documents, said 89 Indian soldiers were in the Maldives.\n\nThe Indian military personnel were stationed in the Maldives to operate and maintain two helicopters and Dornier aircraft New Delhi gifted Male earlier.\n\nAs per The Print, the troops were unarmed and were made up of military engineers, trainers and pilots.\n\nMuizzu also notably chose to visit China for his first overseas trip as president and signed a number of defence agreements with Beijing.\n\nJaishankar's visit also comes in the aftermath of relations between the two countries deteriorating after some Maldives' ministers and parliamentarians made negative comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nMuizzu suspended the three ministers after their social media postings, which stirred concern in India and calls for a boycott by Indian tourists who ranked highest in numbers followed by Russia. Chinese tourists figured third.\n\nHowever, it now seems that relations between the two countries seem to be warming again.\n\nIndia in May, after Zameer's trip to New Delhi, extended a $50 million loan to the Maldives.\n\nThis was done at the request of Male.\n\n\"State Bank of India has subscribed for one more year the USD 50 million Government Treasury Bill, issued by the Ministry of Finance of Maldives, upon maturity of the previous subscription. These Government Treasury Bills are subscribed by SBI under by SBI under a unique Government-to-Government arrangement at zero-cost (interest-free) to the Government of Maldives,\" the Indian High Commission in Maldives said in a statement.\n\n\"The continuation of subscription has been made at the special request of the Government of Maldives to secure budgetary support from the Government of India,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Maldivian Foreign Ministry said it appreciated the Indian government's support.\n\nNew Delhi also removed curbs on the export of essential goods such as eggs, potatoes, onions, rice, wheat flour, sugar, and dal for Male, as per The Print.\n\nIn June, Muizzu called his first official visit to India as a \"success.\"\n\n\"This trip has been a success for the Maldives and for the region too,\" Muizzu told the state-run PSM Media.\n\n\"God willing, the strong ties between the two nations will result in increased prosperity for the Maldives and Maldivians alike,\" Muizzu added.\n\nHis election had raised expectations in China that the archipelagic state strategically located in the Indian Ocean close to India's southern coast would pursue pro-Beijing policies, unlike Solih who pursued an India-first policy and established close ties with New Delhi.\n\nObservers say despite his party's pro-China rhetoric, Muizzu, a British-educated civil engineer, would likely follow a more nuanced foreign policy as the country faces a precarious economy with several debt repayments due, taking a cue from the worst economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia stepped in with $4 billion in assistance to Sri Lanka while China dithered despite massive BRI investments in the country including the Hambantota port which Beijing took over for a 99-year lease as debt swap.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.

This comes after Muizzu visited New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June this year for the latter's third term in office. Ahead of this, Moosa visited India in May this year during the course of which he stated that there was a misunderstanding between the two countries \"and we have passed that stage now\". The Maldives is also running a tourism roadshow in India to attract Indians with that country's Tourism Minister Ibrahim Faisal taking a proactive role in this.\n\nHowever, according to Anand Kumar, Associate Fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses and author of the book Multi-party Democracy in the Maldives and the Emerging Security Environment in the Indian Ocean Region, the Maldives' reach-out will be judged by India on the basis of what that country does on issues of strategic concern for New Delhi.\n\nTies between India and the Maldives had gone south since Muizzu became President. Muizzu had won last year's presidential election on a pronounced anti-India plank. He ran an 'India Out' campaign in which he called for the withdrawal of some Indian military personnel present in his country. These personnel, numbering less than 100, were primarily involved in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation. However, after assuming office, Muizzu made a formal request to India to withdraw these personnel. These personnel have now been replaced by civilians from India.\n\nIn December last year, the Maldives decided not to renew a hydrography agreement with India citing national security concerns and the safeguarding of sensitive information. The hydrographic survey agreement was signed on June 8, 2019, during Modi's visit to the Maldives. Under the agreement, India was allowed to conduct a comprehensive study of the island nation's territorial waters, which includes reefs, lagoons, coastlines, ocean currents and tide levels.\n\nAnd then again, in January this year, the Maldives decided to allow a Chinese vessel to enter its territorial waters ostensibly to do research work. This decision came despite pressure from the Indian government and concerns raised by various quarters about the vessel being a \"spy vessel\". India has strongly been protesting the repeated visits by Chinese vessels to the waters of the south Indian Ocean, a region New Delhi considers to be under its sphere of influence.\n\nAlso, in early January this year, a political row broke out between India and the Maldives after Prime Minister Modi visited the union territory of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea and promoted it on social media as an exciting tourism destination. Though Modi did not mention any other country in his comments, some Maldivian politicians took it as the Lakshadweep islands being showcased as a rival to the tourism industry in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation. They made disparaging remarks against the Prime Minister and racist comments against Indians in general.\n\nThis sparked a social media backlash from Indians, including entertainment world celebrities and sports stars. Many opposition leaders and tourism industry bodies in the Maldives also criticised the Muizzu government for this. Following this, three junior ministers in the Maldives government were suspended.\n\nSoon after the row, Muizzu went on a nearly week-long visit to China. This was a break from the practice followed by his three immediate democratically elected predecessors - Ibrahim Solih, Abdulla Yameen and Mohamed Nasheed - who had made India the destination of their first state visit after assuming office. In fact, after assuming office in November last year, Muizzu made Turkey the destination of his first state visit.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.

The relationship between the two countries worsened further after three Maldivian ministers made derogatory comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his visit to Lakshadweep.\n\nHowever, it seems the two countries are now trying to iron out their differences. The Maldivian President's recent visit to India to attend PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi was perceived as a renewed effort to bring bilateral ties between the countries back on track.\n\nAfter returning from India, Muizzu described his first official visit as a \"success\" for the Maldives and the region. \"This trip has been a success for the Maldives and for the region too,\" he told the state-run PSM Media at the end of his first India visit.\n\nIn June, Prime Minister Modi had also extended Eid-ul-Adha greetings to Muizzu. Now, Jaishankar's three-day visit to the country is also hinting towards the same effort (mending ties).", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddhi_gaharwar@news9live.com", "name": "Siddhi Gaharwar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Before this summer, India had for decades maintained a military presence in the Maldives, consisting of 75 troops as well as two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft. These Indian troops were unarmed and comprised military engineers, trainers and pilots.\n\nApart from Muizzu's presence at Modi's swearing-in ceremony, India-Maldives ties appear to see some gradual thawing. The Maldivian foreign minister also visited New Delhi in May.\n\nShortly after the visit, India agreed to roll over a $50 million loan to the Maldives after the Muizzu government made a special request to \"secure budgetary support\" from New Delhi. The roll-over temporarily eased Male's debt repayment schedule, which is set to spike to over $1 billion in 2026.\n\nEarlier, India had also removed export curbs on essential goods like eggs, potatoes, onions, rice, wheat flour, sugar, and dal for Maldives.

Jaishankar's three-day visit to the Maldives, beginning August 9, 2024, marks the first high-level interaction between the two countries since President Mohamed Muizzu's election in November 2023. This visit is poised to play a significant role in redefining the bilateral relationship between India and the Maldives.\n\nJaishankar is scheduled to meet several top officials during his trip, including President Mohamed Muizzu and Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) emphasized the importance of this relationship for India's 'Neighbourhood First' policy and the SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) vision.\n\nJaishankar's visit is significant for several reasons:\n\nJaishankar's visit follows a period of increased diplomatic activity. President Muizzu had previously visited India for Prime Minister Modi's swearing-in and expressed optimism about future bilateral cooperation.

This campaign features a series of tourism roadshows in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru from July 30 to August 3, as reported by The Print.\n\nThis push for tourism comes in response to a 42% decline in Indian tourist arrivals in the first four months of this year compared to the same period in 2023. Just last year, Indian tourists were the largest group of foreign visitors to the Maldives, with China ranking third.\n\nThe Maldives' strategic position in the Indian Ocean has long anchored its ties with India, driven by India's 'Neighborhood First' policy. Historically, the two nations have enjoyed robust diplomatic relations, with India providing substantial economic and security assistance. However, this relationship has faced turbulence, particularly during the presidency of Abdulla Yameen (2013-2018), who fostered nationalist, anti-India sentiments while aligning more closely with China.\n\nThe election of President Ibrahim Solih in 2018 marked a thaw in relations, with his 'India First' policy emphasizing economic and defense partnerships with India. Despite these efforts, anti-India sentiments were rekindled in 2020 by a coalition between the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) and the People's National Congress (PNC), leading to the 'India Out' campaign. This movement criticized India's involvement in Maldivian affairs, alleging expansionist ambitions and raising concerns over India's investments and defense partnerships.\n\nWith the recent election of President Dr. Mohammed Muizzu, echoes of Yameen's policies have returned, straining diplomatic relations anew. This shift is exemplified by the departure of 76 Indian defense personnel in May 2024, following Muizzu's demand for their withdrawal. This move has disrupted several joint defense projects, highlighting the complexities in the current India-Maldives relationship.\n\nIndia's Strategic Role\n\nIndia's relationship with the Maldives dates back to its recognition of Maldivian independence in 1965. India has been a critical ally, providing budgetary support, infrastructure development, and engaging in numerous bilateral agreements to bolster cybersecurity, maritime security, and regional stability. This support includes significant defense collaborations, such as training for the Maldivian National Defence Force (MNDF) and building defense infrastructure.\n\nDespite recent setbacks, such as the withdrawal of Indian defense personnel, India's contributions remain significant. Between 2021 and 2022, India provided 300 training vacancies to the MNDF, and over the past decade, has trained more than 1,400 MNDF personnel. Key projects include the construction of Ekatha Harbour, an Extended Coastal Surveillance radar system, and the Senahiya MNDF military hospital. Additionally, India has supplied various defense equipment and engaged in joint military exercises to enhance the Maldives' defense capabilities.\n\nEconomic Aid and Development\n\nThe Maldives has become a key beneficiary of India's 'Neighborhood First' policy. In August 2022, India extended over $250 million in financial aid to the Maldives, and by May 2024, further supported the country with a $50 million treasury bill, following a special request during Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer's visit to India.\n\nThis financial aid is complemented by an $800 million line of credit from the Exim Bank of India, which funds extensive infrastructure and community development projects in the Maldives.\n\nKey initiatives include water and sanitation improvements on 34 islands, the Addu Development Project (roads and land reclamation), and the redevelopment of Hanimaadhoo and Gan International Airports.\n\nAdditionally, expansion projects for the Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company in Felivaru and Gemanafushi are underway. These efforts reflect India's commitment to fostering robust bilateral relations and regional stability.\n\nIndia's support also extends to humanitarian assistance during natural disasters. Given the Maldives' dispersed islands and transportation challenges, India's role in medical evacuations is crucial.\n\nSince 2010, Indian defense aircraft, equipped with advanced medical facilities, have been deployed to swiftly evacuate critically ill or injured individuals to mainland healthcare centers.\n\nOver the past five years, these aircraft have rescued over 500 lives, including infants and elderly individuals, even in adverse weather conditions, significantly enhancing emergency medical care across the Maldives.\n\nSignificant initiatives include cybersecurity agreements, water and sanitation projects on 34 islands, the Addu Development Project, and airport redevelopments. These efforts underscore India's commitment to fostering robust bilateral relations and regional stability.\n\nChina's Influence\n\nChina's growing presence in the Maldives has raised geopolitical concerns, with fears of economic dependency and potential erosion of Maldivian sovereignty. During Yameen's presidency, the Maldives embraced China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), leading to several Agreements and significant infrastructure projects funded by Chinese loans. By 2018, the Maldives owed around $1.5 billion to China, a debt that has since ballooned to $5.6 billion.\n\nAnalysts warn that this debt could lead to a 'debt-trap' scenario, similar to Sri Lanka's experience with the Hambantota Port. Beijing's refusal to restructure Maldivian debt during economic crises underscores the risks of heavy reliance on Chinese financial support.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nDespite the challenges, recent diplomatic efforts signal a potential reset in India-Maldives relations. President Muizzu's visit to New Delhi in May 2024, the first high-level visit since his election, marked a significant step towards reconciliation.\n\nThe Third High-Level Core Group meeting in Mal\u00e9 in March 2024 further highlighted progress in various bilateral initiatives, including replacing Indian military personnel with civilians and enhancing development projects.\n\nThe Maldives' active participation in regional security initiatives, despite its engagements with China, underscores its commitment to maintaining a balanced foreign policy. The path forward for India-Maldives relations remains complex, but ongoing diplomatic engagements and cooperative efforts signal a promising trajectory for these two Indian Ocean neighbors.",

Image/X/ @DrSJaishankar\n\nMinister of External Affairs S Jaishankar will visit the Maldives on Friday.\n\nJaishankar's visit will follow the visit of the Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu in June when he came to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said the Ministry of External Affairs.\n\nThe MEA further said that Jaishankar will be in the Maldives for three days till Sunday.\n\nThe statement further said that Jaishankar's visit is aimed at strengthening the bilateral partnership between India and the Maldives and stressed on the nation's centrality for India's vision for the neighbourhood.\n\n\"Maldives is India's key maritime neighbour and an important partner in India's 'Neighbourhood First' Policy and our Vision 'SAGAR' i.e. Security and Growth for All in the Region. The visit is aimed at strengthening the close partnership between the two countries and to explore avenues to enhance the bilateral relationship further,\" said the MEA in a statement.\n\nSince Muizzu took over as the President of the Maldives, the bilateral relations have been tense as he has been the leader of the 'India Out' movement in the nation and has been close to China -- India's principal adversary. He had also led a vitriolic campaign against the deployment of Indian helicopters and military personnel in the country for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) purposes.\n\nAs Muizzu pressed on with his anti-India politics, the relations between the two country nosedived. Lately, however, there have been signs that Muizzu is seeking a stable working relationship with India by ditching overt animosity.\n\nJaishankar had last visited the Maldives in January 2023.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaishankar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaishankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Maldives"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

This latest development comes as the nation's economy undergoes a severe crisis and is struggling to stay afloat. To be clear, the crisis has long been in the making, and the economy was in deep distress when Muizzu inherited the presidency in November 2023. However, nine months into power, Muizzu has further exacerbated these challenges. While the government has initiated some reforms, it lacks a long-term plan to stabilise or immunise the economy against external shocks and is making itself vulnerable to competition between India and China.\n\nThe crisis in the Maldives has been long in the making and emanates from its structural issues. As a nation of almost 1,200 islands, the economy has less diversification and a production base. Its primary revenue sources are tourism, import and green, and property taxes. However, subsequent governments have advocated for mega-infrastructure, housing projects, social welfare schemes, subsidies, state-owned enterprises, and bureaucratic expansion to further their political needs and voter base. For years, the country has sustained itself with a growing budget deficit, supported through grants and loans. However, external shocks like COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war have impacted its revenue and foreign reserves, compelling the then-Ibrahim Solih government to borrow substantially from private lenders and India. As a result, the total debt stock in the Maldives increased from US$ 3 billion in 2018 to US$ 8 billion in 2023. Therefore, burdening the state with more debts, even as it was repaying those borrowed from private lenders and China under President Abdulla Yameen (2013-2018).\n\nThe crisis in the Maldives has been long in the making and emanates from its structural issues. As a nation of almost 1,200 islands, the economy has less diversification and a production base.\n\nThe economic conditions have begun to deteriorate further under Muizzu, with high inflation, increasing imports, and a reduction in fish exports and tourism revenues. Despite knowing the dire conditions of the economy, Muizzu continued to maintain a budget deficit. Incidentally, the government aimed to raise over US$ 200 million in budget support in its initial days. Furthermore, for political reasons, the government appointed over 300 ministers and (allegedly) 2,000 political appointments, leading to a recurring expenditure of over US$65 million every month.\n\nHowever, a major challenge emanates from the country's ever-increasing debt stocks and maturing loans. As of March 2024, the Maldives has a staggering debt-to-GDP ratio of 110 percent. This accounts for an overall debt of US$ 8.2 billion. Over US$ 4.8 billion of these loans are domestic, and US$ 3.4 billion is external. These domestic borrowings from commercial banks, financial corporations, and central banks are in the form of treasury bills and bonds at high interest rates and low repayment time. On external debt, there are three prominent lenders (see Table 1) bondholders, China EXIM, and India EXIM. Additionally, several state-owned enterprises have also borrowed from external creditors (see Table 2) in the form of sovereign guarantees (SG). Approximately 70 percent of these SGs are offered by Chinese lenders and 18 percent by Indian EXIM. In both cases, Chinese debt stock is depleting while Indian debt stocks are increasing, implying that most Chinese loans and some external bonds are maturing.\n\nTable 1. External lenders for Maldives' central government (BCG) debt\n\nSource: Debt Bulletin, (2024, Quarter 1), Ministry of Finance, Maldives\n\nTable 2. External lenders for Maldives' state guarantee (SG) debt\n\nSource: Debt Bulletin, (2024, Quarter 1), Ministry of Finance, Maldives\n\nSubstantial debt stocks and maturing loans, combined with structural issues are thus contributing to a swift reduction in foreign reserves and revenues. By the end of May, Maldives' reserves stood at US$ 492 million, of which only US$ 73 million is usable. The World Bank estimates that foreign reserves of 512 million are necessary for sustaining debts in 2024 and 2025, and for 2026, the government would need a reserve of 1.07 billion. Some SOEs have even stopped undertaking new projects, and there are discussions to temporarily shut down nine embassies to cut down on the government's expenditures.\n\nSubstantial debt stocks and maturing loans, combined with structural issues are thus contributing to a swift reduction in foreign reserves and revenues.\n\nConsidering that the redemption profile is dominated by external debts starting next year, the government has sought help from India and China in debt restructuring. China has offered a grant of USD 130 million and recently commenced its technical work to grant a grace period of five years (read till the end of Muizzu's tenure) on all of Maldives' interest and principal payments. However, there is little clarity about debt restructuring on sovereign guarantees offered by China. On the other hand, India announced over US$ 91 million in assistance to the Maldives last year and offered another US$ 47 million in assistance this year. Besides, Indian EXIM had disbursed over US$ 29 million in the first quarter of this year; over 65 percent of Indian loans to the Maldives are yet disbursed. In May, the State Bank of India also deferred the repayment of a US$ 50 million bill by a year upon its maturity. Maldives is also exploring the possibilities of signing a currency swap agreement and trading in local currencies with both countries. There are also discussions of India helping the country access credit lines.\n\nHowever, this approach seems to be inadequate and short-sighted. First and foremost, there is hardly any policy to deal with the country's domestic and non-bilateral debts (like external bonds) which make up the most of debt stocks and immediate redemption profile. To be sure, the Muizzu administration has kick-started some initiatives to boost revenues. It has passed a law to strengthen customs and tax administration and will recover US$ 513 million in revenues. It is also keen on reforming the SOEs by modernising them and dissolving or merging others. Negotiations on the changes in health insurance schemes and offering targeted and direct transfer of subsidies are ongoing. Payments in Mal\u00e9's commercial harbour are being collected in US dollars, and a development bank will soon be operational to invest in sustainable economic and social development and raise funds for infrastructure.\n\nSecond, Muizzu's preference for a five-year grace period with China and use of debt restructuring as a window of opportunity to diversify the economy and push for mega-infrastructure projects will continue to pile debts and exacerbate structural challenges. For instance, Muizzu is keen on introducing bunkering, transhipment, and international financial services to diversify the economy. These services will have to compete with their existing and well-established counterparts in India and Sri Lanka. Muizzu is also increasing the number of airports from 16 to 31 and is building three new bridges to connect distant islands. The government has also proposed a monorail system, underwater tunnels, and reclaiming of several islands. It has promised to build over 100,000 housing units -- 40,000 in Northern and Southern provinces and 65,000 in Rasmale. These projects will pile up debts and challenge economic recovery and debt sustainability. Chinese debts, in particular, will pose a significant challenge to whoever succeeds Muizzu.\n\nThis need for investments and funding will make Maldives more vulnerable to competition in the region. For instance, in recent months, having promised debt restructuring and grants, China increased its presence in the Maldives by offering to build roads and houses and upgrading or maintaining infrastructure. Most importantly, it also began to counter India's strategic presence by developing an agricultural zone in UTF, where the former was building a naval harbour; it is also upgrading the Kadhdhoo airport -- where a batch of Indian civilian experts are operating an Indian helicopter. However, with the Muizzu administration now having convinced Beijing to swiftly restructure its debts, China will leverage the negotiations to increase its presence in the country further. And this does not necessarily have to be in the form of mega-infrastructure projects.\n\nThis need for investments and funding will make Maldives more vulnerable to competition in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, with India being the second top external lender, the Maldives' agency to deal with the former is increasingly shrinking. It is thus likely to show more sensitivities to Delhi and mellow down on its pro-China tilt. On its part, EAM, S. Jaishankar's potential visit to the Maldives on 8 August underscores Delhi's attempts to leverage the crisis and move beyond mere working relations. This visit also comes when another SBI treasury bill worth US$ 50 million is set to mature in September. Delhi will thus be exploring new areas of collaboration and projects, and will also be expecting some definitive response on paused initiatives like Addu Police Academy, Indian Consulate, UTF harbour, HICDPs, and increasing Chinese presence around Indian projects.\n\nThe economic crisis in the Maldives seems to be Muizzu's biggest challenge so far. However, the government has no long-term calculation for promoting a resilient economy and dealing with non-bilateral debts. A grace period of five years from China and plans to invest heavily in the country's infrastructure and services indicate that structural issues will continue to exacerbate. As a result, it is becoming more vulnerable to the ongoing India-China competition in the region.\n\nNote: Values in USD are estimates\n\nAditya Gowdara Shivamurthy is an Associate Fellow with the Strategic Studies Programme at the Observer Research Foundation\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

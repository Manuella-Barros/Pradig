Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe homered against the San Francisco Giants in the first inning Monday night to increase his season total to 43, most in the majors and a franchise record. He has homered in his past five games, another team record, and has 22 homers in his past 34 games.\n\nHe would finish the season with 72 homers -- one shy of Barry Bonds' 2001 record -- if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said Sunday.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996.

So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind -- how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes. Stanton? He's already tired of questions about the new ownership, and about his future.\n\nTeam management expects to close on the $1.2 billion sale in early October, so it may be awhile before Jeter can provide any answers.\n\n\"It still has months to process,\" Stanton said with a sigh. \"So we'll just wait it out.\"\n\nHe knows he'll be making $25 million next year somewhere.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2125, "textStart": 2111, "amb": false, "date": "2014-09-"}], "time": "19:34:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "01:50:00", "title": "Giancarlo Stanton always hit 'em far.

Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe homered against the San Francisco Giants in the first inning Monday night to increase his season total to 43, most in the majors and a franchise record. He has homered in his past five games, another team record, and in 22 of his past 34.\n\nHe would finish the season with 72 homers - one shy of Barry Bonds' 2001 record - if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said Sunday.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996. The home run was the 250th for Stanton in 3,407 at-bats, and by that measure, only four players reached the milestone faster - Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Babe Ruth and Ryan Howard.\n\n\"Crazy,\" said Stanton, 27. \"Those are guys you glorified and put on a pedestal as gods as a kid, and you're right there on the same plane as them now. So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind - how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes. Stanton? He's already tired of questions about the new ownership, and about his future.\n\nTeam management expects to close on the $1.2 billion sale in early October, so it may be awhile before Jeter can provide any answers.\n\n\"It still has months to process,\" Stanton said with a sigh. \"So we'll just wait it out.\"\n\nHe knows he'll be making $25 million next year somewhere.", "location":

Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe homered against the San Francisco Giants in the first inning Monday night to increase his season total to 43, most in the majors and a franchise record. He has homered in his past five games, another team record, and in 22 of his past 34.\n\nHe would finish the season with 72 homers - one shy of Barry Bonds' 2001 record - if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said Sunday.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996. The home run was the 250th for Stanton in 3,407 at-bats, and by that measure, only four players reached the milestone faster - Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Babe Ruth and Ryan Howard.\n\n\"Crazy,\" said Stanton, 27. \"Those are guys you glorified and put on a pedestal as gods as a kid, and you're right there on the same plane as them now. So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind - how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes. Stanton? He's already tired of questions about the new ownership, and about his future.\n\nTeam management expects to close on the $1.2 billion sale in early October, so it may be awhile before Jeter can provide any answers.\n\n\"It still has months to process,\" Stanton said with a sigh. \"So we'll just wait it out.\"\n\nHe knows he'll be making $25 million next year somewhere.", "location":

Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe began the week leading the majors with 42 home runs, including 21 in the past 33 games. He would finish the season with 71 homers if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered for the fourth game in a row Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996. The home run was the 250th for Stanton in 3,407 at-bats, and by that measure, only four players reached the milestone faster -- Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Babe Ruth and Ryan Howard.\n\n\"Crazy,\" said Stanton, 27. \"Those are guys you glorified and put on a pedestal as gods as a kid, and you're right there on the same plane as them now. So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind -- how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes. Stanton? He's already tired of questions about the new ownership, and about his future.\n\nTeam management expects to close on the $1.2 billion sale in early October, so it may be awhile before Jeter can provide any answers.\n\n\"It still has months to process,\" Stanton said with a sigh. \"So we'll just wait it out.\"\n\nHe knows he'll be making $25 million next year somewhere.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

He has 15 RBIs in that span.\n\nStanton went deep on a 1-1 pitch off Colorado starter Jeff Hoffman with two outs in the inning, bringing home Miguel Rojas, who singled, and Dee Gordon, who reached on a fielder's choice. The blast gave Miami a 4-1 lead.\n\nStanton hit a one-out double (his 25th of the season) in the first inning and later scored on a Marcell Ozuna groundout. He hit a one-out single in the third, but was stranded on second as the Marlins left the bases loaded.\n\nThe 3-for-r4 night lifts Stanton to a .366 average (15-for-41) in August.\n\nStanton's home run total is his highest single-season mark, surpassing the 37 he hit in both 2012 and 2014. He now has 89 RBIs this season, second only to the he had in 2014.\n\nStanton has played for the Marlins franchise his entire career. He hit 22 home runs in his 2010 rookie season and added 34 the following year. In 2012, the Marlins officially changed their name from Florida to Miami, and Stanton went from being Mike (his middle name) to Giancarlo.\n\nHe made the All-Star team for the first time in 2012, but slumped to 24 homers the following year.

Stanton has hit seven home runs in his last eight games to reach the 40-home run plateau for the first time in his eight-year career.\n\n\"In due time,\" Stanton said of breaking the club record with 48 games remaining. \"We have time. Just have to play right.\"\n\nJunichi Tazawa (2-2) tossed a scoreless eighth to earn the victory and Brad Ziegler pitched the ninth to record his third save in six chances. Jake McGee (0-2) took the loss for the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the third on Arenado's two-run home run, his 26th, making him the first player in the majors with 100 RBIs.\n\n\"He's having a great year for sure,\" Rockies manager Bud Black said. \"He's one of the best players in the game and he's doing it every day. . This guy has come into his own as a player, has improved offensively to the point now where he's one of the most dangerous hitters in the game and the numbers speak for themselves on this.\"\n\nStanton and Arenado are having impressive seasons, but not to be outdone, Rockies' center fielder Charlie Blackmon is having an MVP-caliber season. Blackmon went 1 for 3 with a double, a run scored, and two walks in addition to making an impressive running catch towards the wall.\n\nGerardo Parra homered in the sixth for the Rockies, who have lost three of four after dropping the first of a three-game series in Miami.\n\n\"It would be nice to string some hits together,\" Black said. \"We just haven't done it.\"\n\nParra, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, also had two assists from left field throwing out runners in the third and fourth innings.\n\n\"He's got a very capable arm,\" Black said. \"That's one of his strengths as a player. It's another plus tool for him so that was good to see.\"\n\nDietrich scored Miami's first run in the fifth when Miguel Rojas grounded into a double play.\n\nStanton's solo homer to left field in the sixth off Jon Gray pulled the Marlins within 3-2. It was his 25th solo home run of the season.\n\nChristian Yelich followed Stanton with a double to left and scored on a sacrifice fly by J.T. Realmuto to tie the game at 3.\n\nGray allowed three runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings, striking out four and walking two.\n\n\"I just expanded too much,\" Gray said. \"I should have went right after guys, but it's just a note to self. It can't happen again.\"\n\nThe Rockies trailed for the first time when McGee allowed a lead-off single to Yelich, who advanced to second on a walk, and scored on Dietrich's bloop fly single to center field.\n\nTomas Telis followed with a two-run triple to stretch Miami's lead to 6-3.\n\n\"I was just a little off tonight and then when I needed to make a few pitches ... I left pitches over the middle of the plate and that's what's going to happen,\" McGee said.\n\nMiami starter Jose Urena allowed three runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings, striking out three and walking one.\n\nColorado manager Bud Black is undecided on Monday's starting pitcher against Atlanta. Black is considering a trio of right-handers in Chad Bettis, Antonio Senzatela, and Tyler Chatwood.\n\nRockies: OF Ian Desmond (right calf strain) is \"still a ways away\" from beginning a rehab assignment, according to Black. Desmond has been on the disabled list since July 26.\n\nMarlins: 1B Justin Bour (right oblique strain) is progressing with activity, but will not do any baseball-related activity until he is pain-free. . LHP Wei-Yin Chen (arm) is progressing with his throwing program and is scheduled to throw a live batting practice on Saturday. . RHP Kyle Barraclough (shoulder) threw 14 pitches in a GCL rehab assignment game on Thursday and is scheduled to throw one inning for Single-A Jupiter on Saturday. . SS JT Riddle (shoulder) had season-ending surgery on Friday to repair a torn labrum.\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (6-3, 5.03 ERA) will take the mound in the second game of the series on Saturday. Hoffman is coming off one of his best performances of the season allowing one run and striking out eight over seven innings against Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\nMarlins: LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.31) will make his return to the big leagues for the first time since a relief appearance on June 28 against the Mets. Nicolino is 7-11 with a 4.76 ERA in 30 career starts.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates":

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nBut lately, he looks like a keeper at any price. Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe began the week leading the majors with 42 home runs, including 21 in the past 33 games. He would finish the season with 71 homers if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered for the fourth game in a row Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996. The home run was the 250th for Stanton in 3,407 at-bats, and by that measure, only four players reached the milestone faster - Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Babe Ruth and Ryan Howard.\n\n\"Crazy,\" said Stanton, 27. \"Those are guys you glorified and put on a pedestal as gods as a kid, and you're right there on the same plane as them now. So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind - how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes.

Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe began the week leading the majors with 42 home runs, including 21 in the past 33 games. He would finish the season with 71 homers if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered for the fourth game in a row Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996. The home run was the 250th for Stanton in 3,407 at-bats, and by that measure, only four players reached the milestone faster - Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Babe Ruth and Ryan Howard.\n\n\"Crazy,\" said Stanton, 27. \"Those are guys you glorified and put on a pedestal as gods as a kid, and you're right there on the same plane as them now. So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind - how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes. Stanton? He's already tired of questions about the new ownership, and about his future.\n\nTeam management expects to close on the $1.2 billion sale in early October, so it may be awhile before Jeter can provide any answers.\n\n\"It still has months to process,\" Stanton said with a sigh. \"So we'll just wait it out.\"\n\nHe knows he'll be making $25 million next year somewhere.\n\n--\n\nMore AP

Stanton has hit seven home runs in his last eight games to reach the 40-home run plateau for the first time in his eight-year career.\n\n\"In due time,\" Stanton said of breaking the club record with 48 games remaining. \"We have time. Just have to play right.\"\n\nJunichi Tazawa (2-2) tossed a scoreless eighth to earn the victory and Brad Ziegler pitched the ninth to record his third save in six chances. Jake McGee (0-2) took the loss for the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the third on Arenado's two-run home run, his 26th, making him the first player in the majors with 100 RBIs.\n\n\"He's having a great year for sure,\" Rockies manager Bud Black said. \"He's one of the best players in the game and he's doing it every day. . This guy has come into his own as a player, has improved offensively to the point now where he's one of the most dangerous hitters in the game and the numbers speak for themselves on this.\"\n\nStanton and Arenado are having impressive seasons, but not to be outdone, Rockies' center fielder Charlie Blackmon is having an MVP-caliber season. Blackmon went 1 for 3 with a double, a run scored, and two walks in addition to making an impressive running catch towards the wall.\n\nGerardo Parra homered in the sixth for the Rockies, who have lost three of four after dropping the first of a three-game series in Miami.\n\n\"It would be nice to string some hits together,\" Black said. \"We just haven't done it.\"\n\nParra, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, also had two assists from left field throwing out runners in the third and fourth innings.\n\n\"He's got a very capable arm,\" Black said. \"That's one of his strengths as a player. It's another plus tool for him so that was good to see.\"\n\nDietrich scored Miami's first run in the fifth when Miguel Rojas grounded into a double play.\n\nStanton's solo homer to left field in the sixth off Jon Gray pulled the Marlins within 3-2. It was his 25th solo home run of the season.\n\nChristian Yelich followed Stanton with a double to left and scored on a sacrifice fly by J.T. Realmuto to tie the game at 3.\n\nGray allowed three runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings, striking out four and walking two.\n\n\"I just expanded too much,\" Gray said. \"I should have went right after guys, but it's just a note to self. It can't happen again.\"\n\nThe Rockies trailed for the first time when McGee allowed a lead-off single to Yelich, who advanced to second on a walk, and scored on Dietrich's bloop fly single to center field.\n\nTomas Telis followed with a two-run triple to stretch Miami's lead to 6-3.\n\n\"I was just a little off tonight and then when I needed to make a few pitches ... I left pitches over the middle of the plate and that's what's going to happen,\" McGee said.\n\nMiami starter Jose Urena allowed three runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings, striking out three and walking one.\n\nROCKIES UNDECIDED ON MONDAY'S STARTER\n\nColorado manager Bud Black is undecided on Monday's starting pitcher against Atlanta. Black is considering a trio of right-handers in Chad Bettis, Antonio Senzatela, and Tyler Chatwood.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: OF Ian Desmond (right calf strain) is \"still a ways away\" from beginning a rehab assignment, according to Black. Desmond has been on the disabled list since July 26.\n\nMarlins: 1B Justin Bour (right oblique strain) is progressing with activity, but will not do any baseball-related activity until he is pain-free. . LHP Wei-Yin Chen (arm) is progressing with his throwing program and is scheduled to throw a live batting practice on Saturday. . RHP Kyle Barraclough (shoulder) threw 14 pitches in a GCL rehab assignment game on Thursday and is scheduled to throw one inning for Single-A Jupiter on Saturday. . SS JT Riddle (shoulder) had season-ending surgery on Friday to repair a torn labrum.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (6-3, 5.03 ERA) will take the mound in the second game of the series on Saturday. Hoffman is coming off one of his best performances of the season allowing one run and striking out eight over seven innings against Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\nMarlins: LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.31) will make his return to the big leagues for the first time since a relief appearance on June 28 against the Mets. Nicolino is 7-11 with a 4.76 ERA in 30 career starts.\n\n.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"},

With the exception of his rookie season in 2010, Stanton has suffered a slew of injuries, missing playing time with knee issues in 2011 and 2012. A Grade 2 hamstring strain sidelined him in 2013.\n\nIn early September 2014, Stanton was leading the majors in home runs with 37 when he was hit in the face with a pitch from former-Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Mike Fiers, officially ending his season. A hand injury in June 2015 ended Stanton's season early yet again, and in August 2016, a Grade 3 groin strain ended the slugger's season.\n\nStanton has shown that he could be one of the greatest home run hitters in baseball but he couldn't seem to stay healthy, until now. He's had a good season so far and right now he is hitting the ball like crazy.\n\nStanton has hit 19 home runs in his last 31 games. This has propelled him into first place in the majors. After hitting his 40th home run on Friday night off of Colorado Rockies' pitcher Jon Gray, he is now five home runs ahead of the next player on the list, New York Yankees' rookie Aaron Judge.\n\nThanks to Statcast\u2122, we know that Stanton's home run \"projected at 433 feet, with an exit velocity of 111.2 mph. The no-doubter to left came off Gray's 89.4-mph slider.\"\n\nReaching 40 homes this early in the season is a rare feat, one Stanton could have accomplished in 2014 before being hit by Fier's pitch. Still, that was in September, it is still August. According to MLB.com's Joe Frisaro, \"the last players with 40 homers in their team's first 114 games: Stanton (2017), Chris Davis ('13), David Ortiz ('06), Barry Bonds ('01), Luis Gonzalez ('01) and Sammy Sosa ('01).\"\n\nStanton, when healthy, is finally proving that he can be one of the league's elite power hitters. It was always assumed he would be if he could play a full season. It shouldn't come as a surprise that, at 6 feet 6 inches and 245 pounds, Stanton is one of the biggest players in the majors and he can make the ball fly.\n\nHe simply needs to remain healthy for the remainder of the season and he may just hit more home runs than anyone else has since the Steroid Era, when players were easily hitting 50-plus home runs. Currently, he is just two home runs shy of the Marlins' franchise single-season home run record of 42 that was set by Gary Sheffield in 1996. He also the leads the franchise overall in home runs with 248.\n\nManager Don Mattingly also believes that Stanton's health is a major factor in his success.\n\n\"This year, he's been able to stay on the field. Hopefully that continues and we really see a full year out of 'G' that really shows why people look at him as one of the most-feared guys in the game.\"\n\nEclipsing 50 home runs this season would most definitely make pitchers even more unhappy to see Stanton striding to the plate.\n\nAs for Stanton, he was happy to finally get to 40 home runs, saying after the game that hitting the milestone was \"definitely pretty cool.\" However, what he really cares about is helping his team get wins. At 54-60 the Marlins are still six games under the 0.500 mark.\n\n\"I've got a ways to go, though. But I'm glad I could get to that finally and help us win.

But it's a cool thing to have under my belt, and I have time to get more.\"\n\nThe Marlins (56-60) swept the series from Colorado (65-52). It was Miami's first three-game sweep since July 7-9 at the San Francisco Giants, and its first home sweep since beating the Philadelphia Phillies in May.\n\nColorado still has a four-game lead in the battle for one of two NL wild-card spots, but the Rockies have lost five of their past six games.\n\nTo make matters worse for Colorado, third baseman Nolan Arenado, who leads the majors in RBIs, was hit on the left hand by a pitch from Marlins starter Vance Worley. Arenado left the game immediately, but X-rays were negative.\n\n\"It hurt real bad,\" Arenado said. \"It got real tight. That was my concern -- how tight it was getting. Luckily, it's not broken, but it's swollen pretty good. It's hard to move my pinkie.\n\n\"I've gotten hit in the hand before, but it didn't feel like this. It was a two-seam fastball, up and in. I tried to get out of the way, but it hit me. Whenever you get hit in the hand, it scares you.\"\n\nArenado, a four-time Gold Glove winner and a three-time All-Star, said he was told by team doctors that a stint on the disabled list is not likely.\n\n\"It will take some time,\" Arenado said, \"hopefully (just) a couple days.\"\n\nEither way, it was a frustrating series for Arenado, who was ejected from Saturday's game after he was called out on a check swing.\n\nStanton, who leads the majors in homers, had a much better weekend. He became the sixth-fastest player to reach 250 homers, dating to 1913. Stanton also has hit nine homers in the past 10 games and 21 in the past 33.\n\n\"Big G (Stanton) is impressive,\" said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, a great hitter in his day.\n\nBesides Stanton, the key for Miami on Sunday was the bullpen. Starter Vance Worley lasted just four-plus innings and got a no-decision. But reliever Javy Guerra (1-0) got out of a two-on, two-out jam created by Worley in the fifth. Guerra pitched two hitless and scoreless innings, earning his first major-league win since 2014.\n\nOverall, Miami's bullpen pitched five scoreless innings. That includes Odrisamer Despaigne, who pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his first major-league save.\n\nColorado starter German Marquez (9-5) took the loss, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings. His streak of six straight quality starts -- a Rockies rookie record -- was snapped. He had been 4-0 with a 2.95 ERA during that stretch.\n\nMiami opened the scoring with two runs in the second. After J.T. Realmuto was hit by a pitch and Tomas Telis singled, the Marlins had runners on second and third with two outs.\n\nOn a 2-2 count, Worley hit an outside pitch to right field. Colorado's Carlos Gonzalez made a diving catch, but it was trapped, and his strong throw home could not prevent two runs from scoring.\n\nColorado took a 3-2 lead in the third. Like Miami's rally, this one was also started by a leadoff hit-by-pitch. After Charlie Blackmon was plunked and DJ LeMahieu singled, Colorado pounced.\n\nGerardo Parra had an RBI single, and Gonzalez hit a two-run single. Ryan McMahon nearly had an RBI groundout. But upon video replay, he was called out at first, and the Marlins took a run off the board on an inning-ending double play.\n\nStanton's homer, an opposite-field job to right in the bottom of the third, tied the score 3-3.\n\n\"It was a good pitch,\" Marquez said of his 98-mph fastball on the outside corner. \"But he's a good hitter.\"\n\nMiami took a 5-3 lead in the fourth on Mike Aviles' two-round double into the left-field corner, and the bullpen did the rest.\n\nNOTES: Rockies rookie 1B Ryan McMahon, who made his first big-league start, got an eighth-inning single for his first hit. ... Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton leads the majors with 19 go-ahead homers, which is also a franchise record. Stanton's homer on Saturday was No. 100 for him in his career at Marlins Park. ... Rockies manager Bud Black (illness) was back in the dugout after missing Saturday's game. ... The Rockies return home on Monday to face the Atlanta Braves. Colorado RHP Chad Bettis, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in November of 2016, will make his 2017 big-league debut. ...

The homer was Stanton's 21st in the past 33 games.\n\nIt was the 250th homer of Stanton's career and came in his 941st game. Only five players since 1913 have reached the 250-milestone faster.\n\nRockies All-Star third baseman Nolan Arenado, the major league RBI leader, left the game in the fifth inning after being hit on the left hand by an 88-mph fastball thrown by Vance Worley.\n\nColorado manager Bud Black returned to the dugout after missing one game because of illness.\n\nGerman Marquez (9-5) lost for the first time in his past seven starts, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings. Worley gave up three runs in four-plus innings but contributed a two-run single.\n\nJavy Guerra (1-0) earned his first victory since 2014 with two scoreless innings. He protected a two-run lead in the fifth, when he came on with runners at second and third and none out, and escaped without allowing a run.\n\nOdrisamer Despaigne pitched a perfect ninth for his first career save.\n\nStanton lined a 3-2 pitch over the right field fence to make the score 3-all, giving him at least one home run in eight of the past 10 games. He leads the majors in homers, and his 16 since the All-Star break are also the most.\n\nSEA LEVEL WOES\n\nThe Rockies went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position, and went 5 for 39 (.128) in those situations on their five-game trip.\n\nThe rough weekend is nothing new for the Rockies in Miami, where their all-time record is 35-64.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis will complete his comeback from chemotherapy for testicular cancer by starting Monday night's game in Denver against Atlanta. RHP Julio Teheran (7-10, 5.25) is scheduled to start for the Braves.\n\nMarlins: LHP Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43) is scheduled to start Monday against the San Francisco Giants and LHP Ty Blach (8-7,

As long as I get extension and get lift on the ball it's going to go. Sometimes they're hard grounders. Sometimes it's fly balls. It's one of those grooves.\"\n\nHe needs one home run to tie Gary Sheffield for the Marlins' single-season mark set in 1996.\n\n\"It's been fun, fun time every night, downloading info on the pitchers, making sure I'm on time,\" Stanton said. \"The daily preparation has been fun.\"\n\nStanton has hit 20 home runs in his last 32 games. The last player to accomplish the feat in the same season was the Los Angeles Dodgers' Shawn Green in 2002, according to STATS LLC.\n\n\"Obviously it's a pretty special streak. Twenty homers in 32 games is unbelievable,\" said Rockies All-Star third baseman Nolan Arenado. \"I've never heard anything like that. He's got 20 homers in 32 games. I've got 26 homers in four-and-a-half months.\"\n\nJeff Hoffman (6-4) allowed four runs and seven hits in five innings. Hoffman gave up Stanton's three-run homer in the fourth.\n\n\"He's playing up there with the best of them right now,\" Hoffman said. \"You'd almost rather just walk him there and take your medicine or just stay away from him and hope he gets himself out.\"\n\nRockies center fielder Charlie Blackmon went 4 for 5 with two runs scored and two stolen bases. It was the 15th time this season Blackmon has had at least three hits and his third four-hit game.\n\nMiami starter Justin Nicolino (1-1) pitched 5 1/3 innings, allowing two runs, one earned, in his first appearance since June 28. Brad Ziegler struck out Gerardo Parra with runners on first and second to end the game for his fourth save in six opportunities.\n\nArenado was ejected in the seventh inning by first base umpire Pat Hoberg after Hoberg called Arenado out on a checked swing appeal and Arenado threw his bat in disgust.\n\n\"Obviously I thought I didn't go, but I was mostly mad at myself,\" Arenado said. \"I can see why he threw me out. I said some words I probably shouldn't have said towards him so I can see why I got thrown out.\"\n\nRockies manager Bud Black was ill before the game and bench coach Mike Redmond, who was the Marlins manager for parts of three seasons from 2013-15, handled the managerial duties.\n\nThe Rockies have dropped four of five.\n\n\"We've been really good throughout the year at two-out hits and big hits, and right now they're not coming,\" Redmond said.\n\nBoth teams scored a run in the first inning. The Rockies loaded the bases in the fourth, but Hoffman grounded into a fielder's choice to end the threat.\n\nThe Marlins responded with Stanton's three-run blast in the bottom half to take a 4-1 lead. The home run landed near a bartender who handed the ball to a young Rockies fan.\n\n\"Every time he comes to bat it's a game changer,\" Nicolino said. \"He picked me up right there, kind of takes a lot off my shoulders.\"\n\nBlackmon singled, stole second, advanced to third on an error, and scored on a sacrifice fly by DJ LeMahieu to cut the deficit to 4-2.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez's groundout in the eighth pulled the Rockies within 4-3.\n\nGORDON VISITS DOLPHINS\n\nMarlins second baseman Dee Gordon visited Miami Dolphins practice earlier in the day.\n\n\"He has been coming out,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said. \"I know he's friends with a lot of the guys on the team. He comes out quite a bit in the spring and we'll see him every once and a while in training camp when he gets a chance to pop out. It's always fun to talk with him.\"\n\nRAINES THROWS FIRST PITCH\n\nNewly inducted Hall of Famer Tim Raines threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Raines played his final MLB season for the Marlins in 2002 and there are a number of his former Montreal Expos teammates currently involved with the Marlins organization including Andre Dawson, Tony Perez, and Tim Wallach.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Raines said of the Hall of Fame experience. \"It's very humbling. Not only to have the opportunity to become a Hall of Famer, but to get an opportunity to be in a situation that you'll remember forever. That's a part of history that I think every player would want to have.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMarlins: LHP Wei-Yin Chen has not pitched in a game since May 1 due to arm fatigue, but threw a live batting practice session on Saturday. \"He's been good,\" Mattingly said. \"He hasn't had problems, no setbacks, so he's just progressing.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP German Marquez (9-4, 3.88 ERA) will take the mound in Sunday's series finale. Marquez is 4-0 with a 2.95 ERA over his last six starts, averaging 9.3 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\nMarlins: RHP Vance Worley (2-2, 4.82) will make his fourth consecutive start since rejoining the rotation.

He needs one home run to tie Gary Sheffield for the Marlins' single-season mark set in 1996.\n\nStanton has hit 20 home runs in his last 32 games. The last player to accomplish the feat in the same season was the Los Angeles Dodgers' Shawn Green in 2002, according to STATS LLC.\n\nRockies center fielder Charlie Blackmon went 4 for 5 with two runs scored and two stolen bases. It was the 15th time this season Blackmon has had at least three hits and his third four-hit game.\n\nMiami starter Justin Nicolino (1-1) pitched 5 1/3 innings, allowing two runs, one earned, in his first appearance since June 28. Brad Ziegler struck out Gerardo Parra with runners on first and second to end the game for his fourth save in six opportunities.\n\nJeff Hoffman (6-4) allowed four runs and seven hits in five innings.\n\nColorado third baseman Nolan Arenado was ejected in the seventh inning by first base umpire Pat Hoberg after Hoberg called Arenado out on a checked swing appeal and Arenado threw his bat in disgust.\n\nRockies manager Bud Black was ill before the game and was not in attendance. Bench coach Mike Redmond, who was the Marlins' manager for parts of three seasons from 2013-15, handled the managerial duties.\n\nThe Rockies have dropped four of five.\n\nBoth teams scored a run in the first inning, with Mark Reynolds knocking in one for the Rockies and Marcell Ozuna tying the game on a groundout.\n\nThe Rockies loaded the bases in the fourth, but Hoffman grounded into a fielder's choice to end the threat.\n\nThe Marlins responded with Stanton's three-run blast in the bottom half to take a 4-1 lead. The home run landed near a bartender who handed the ball to a young Rockies fan.\n\nBlackmon singled, stole second, advanced to third on an error, and scored on a sacrifice fly by DJ LeMahieu to cut the deficit to 4-2.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez's groundout in the eighth pulled the Rockies within 4-3.\n\nGORDON VISITS DOLPHINS\n\nMarlins second baseman Dee Gordon visited Miami Dolphins practice earlier in the day.\n\n\"He has been coming out,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said. \"I know he's friends with a lot of the guys on the team. He comes out quite a bit in the spring and we'll see him every once and a while in training camp when he gets a chance to pop out. It's always fun to talk with him. .

He's a competitor.\"\n\nRAINES THROWS FIRST PITCH\n\nNewly inducted Hall of Famer Tim Raines threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Raines played his final MLB season for the Marlins in 2002 and there are a number of his former Montreal Expos teammates currently involved with the Marlins organization including Andre Dawson, Tony Perez, and Tim Wallach.\n\n\"It's been awesome,\" Raines said of the Hall of Fame experience. \"It's very humbling. Not only to have the opportunity to become a Hall of Famer, but to get an opportunity to be in a situation that you'll remember forever. That's a part of history that I think every player would want to have.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMarlins: LHP Wei-Yin Chen has not pitched in a game since May 1 due to arm fatigue, but threw a live batting practice session on Saturday. \"He's been good,\" manager Don Mattingly said. \"He hasn't had problems, no setbacks, so he's just progressing.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP German Marquez (9-4, 3.88 ERA) will take the mound in Sunday's series finale. Marquez is 4-0 with a 2.95 ERA over his last six starts, averaging 9.3 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\nMarlins: RHP Vance Worley (2-2, 4.82) will make his fourth consecutive start since rejoining the rotation.

Watermelon-flavored water, he said.\n\nSo that's the secret?\n\n\"It might be,\" Stanton said. \"I don't know.\"\n\nNo one can really explain his current home run binge, not even Stanton, but it shows no signs of ending. The All-Star slugger reached a couple of milestones Sunday by hitting a homer in his fourth consecutive game, and the Marlins completed their first series sweep of the Colorado Rockies since 2006, winning 5-3.\n\nStanton hit his 42nd homer leading off the third inning to tie Gary Sheffield's team season record set in 1996. It was the 250th homer of Stanton's career and came in his 941st game.\n\nOnly five players since 1913 have reached the 250-milestone faster, and Stanton's pace is accelerating. The homer was his 21st in the past 33 games.\n\n\"There's a lot happening at once,\" Stanton said. \"Just enjoy the ride, and keep it going.\"\n\nStanton made it a long weekend for the Rockies, and their misery was compounded when major league RBI leader Nolan Arenado left the game in the fifth inning with a bruised left hand after being hit by an 88-mph fastball from Vance Worley.\n\nFollowing the game, Arenado said his hand was stiff and swollen, but X-rays were negative. He said he hopes to be sidelined for only a couple of days and is optimistic he can avoid a stint on the disabled list.\n\n\"It hurt real bad,\" the All-Star third baseman said. \"It got real tight. That was my concern -- how tight it was getting. Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts a little bit.\"\n\nGerman Marquez (9-5) lost for the first time in his past seven starts, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings. Worley gave up three runs in four-plus innings but contributed a two-run single.\n\nJavy Guerra (1-0) earned his first victory since 2014 with two scoreless innings. He protected a two-run lead in the fifth, when he came on with runners at second and third and none out, and escaped without allowing a run.\n\nOdrisamer Despaigne pitched a perfect ninth for his first career save. Manager Don Mattingly said he had limited options in the bullpen because of a recent heavy workload, but four relievers combined for five shutout innings.\n\n\"We were a little light,\" Mattingly said. \"Despaigne was probably our last guy we wanted to use today.\"\n\nSTANTON'S SURGE\n\nStanton lined a 3-2 fastball over the right field fence to make the score 3-all, giving him at least one home run in eight of the past 10 games. He leads the majors in homers, and his 16 since the All-Star break are also the most.\n\n\"There are not that many guys who leave that opposite field that often,\" Mattingly said. \"But as soon as he hits it, you know it's gone.\"\n\nAs Stanton reflected on tying the team home run record, he talked about growing up in Los Angeles and attending Dodgers games when Sheffield played for them after leaving the Marlins.\n\n\"I really enjoyed watching him play as a kid,\" Stanton said. \"Definitely good company to be in. It's not something I'll fully appreciate until the year is over, but it's a cool thing to have under my belt, and I've got time to get more.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: Manager Bud Black returned to the dugout after missing one game because of illness.\n\nMarlins: RHP Kyle Barraclough (right shoulder) will be activated in the next couple of days, Mattingly said.\n\nSEA LEVEL WOES\n\nThe Rockies went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position, and 5 for 39 (.128) in those situations on their five-game trip. The rough weekend is nothing new for the Rockies in Miami, where their record is 35-64.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis will complete his comeback from chemotherapy for testicular cancer by starting Monday night's game in Denver against Atlanta.\n\n\"We're all extremely excited to have him back in a big league uniform,\" Black said. \"He has been through a lot in the past nine or 10 months. It's a great comeback for a guy who is a tremendous human being.\"\n\nMarlins: LHP Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43) is scheduled to start Monday against the San Francisco Giants and LHP Ty Blach (8-7, 4.15).",

Stanton's knack for moonshots has long made him the sport's most prodigious slugger, and now he's also the most prolific.\n\nHe began the week leading the majors with 42 home runs, including 21 in the past 33 games. He would finish the season with 71 homers if he continues his pace of the past five weeks.\n\n\"It has been amazing to watch,\" manager Don Mattingly said.\n\n\"You know you're watching something special,\" teammate Javy Guerra said. \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate, and you think he could homer every time. It's a lot of fun to be a fan.\"\n\nStanton homered for the fourth game in a row Sunday against the Colorado Rockies to tie Gary Sheffield's franchise record for homers in a season, set in 1996. The home run was the 250th for Stanton in 3,407 at-bats, and by that measure, only four players reached the milestone faster -- Harmon Killebrew, Ralph Kiner, Babe Ruth and Ryan Howard.\n\n\"Crazy,\" said Stanton, 27. \"Those are guys you glorified and put on a pedestal as gods as a kid, and you're right there on the same plane as them now. So it's something special.\"\n\nThis year is special for Stanton because he has remained healthy, missing only two games. It's the first time since 2011 he has avoided an injury that sidelined him for a lengthy stint.\n\nWorst was a season-ending beaning in September 2014. Stanton led the National League in home runs and RBIs when his face was fractured by a fastball from Mike Fiers of the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe aftermath left Stanton prone to swings and misses on outside breaking pitches. But lately his timing has been excellent, and he began the week batting .281 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career.\n\nHe credits a new closed stance.\n\n\"I'm not pulling off the ball, and I've been more on time and ready to go on off-speed pitches, heaters, everything,\" he said. \"I watched film over and over until my eyes hurt to figure it out.\n\n\"Every year I've had seven or eight different stances, and it's really because I haven't felt comfortable throughout a whole season to keep one. So it's a constant grind -- how do I feel right every day? This was one I hadn't tried yet, and it has been pretty good.\"\n\nPretty good? The stance often leads to a home run trot accompanied by a grin. On Sunday, Stanton even threw in a quick dance step rounding third base.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Mattingly said with a chuckle. \"He smiles a lot when he's hitting homers.\"\n\nStanton said he's having more fun than at any time in his career, even with his team out of the playoff race as usual. This will be the 14th consecutive season the Marlins have missed the postseason, and given their injury-ravaged pitching staff, Stanton harbors no illusions of a miracle run.\n\n\"We've got arms going down like flies,\" he said.\n\nMarlins fans are counting on Jeter to change the team's fortunes. Stanton? He's already tired of questions about the new ownership, and about his future.\n\nTeam management expects to close on the $1.2 billion sale in early October, so it may be awhile before Jeter can provide any answers.\n\n\"It still has months to process,\" Stanton said with a sigh. \"So we'll just wait it out.\"\n\nHe knows he'll be making $25 million next year somewhere.\n\n___\n\nMore AP

Watermelon-flavored water, he said.\n\nNo one can really explain his current home run binge, not even Stanton, but it shows no signs of ending. The All-Star slugger reached a couple of milestones Sunday by hitting a homer in his fourth consecutive game, and the Marlins completed their first series sweep of the Colorado Rockies since 2006, winning 5-3.\n\nStanton hit his 42nd homer leading off the third inning to tie Gary Sheffield's team season record set in 1996. It was the 250th homer of Stanton's career and came in his 941st game.\n\nOnly five players since 1913 have reached the 250-milestone faster, and Stanton's pace is accelerating. The homer was his 21st in the past 33 games.\n\n\"There's a lot happening at once,\" Stanton said. \"Just enjoy the ride, and keep it going.\"\n\nStanton made it a long weekend for the Rockies, and their misery was compounded when major league RBI leader Nolan Arenado left the game in the fifth inning with a bruised left hand after being hit by an 88-mph fastball from Vance Worley.\n\nFollowing the game, Arenado said his hand was stiff and swollen, but X-rays were negative. He said he hopes to be sidelined for only a couple of days and is optimistic he can avoid a stint on the disabled list.\n\n\"It hurt real bad,\" the All-Star third baseman said. \"It got real tight. That was my concern -- how tight it was getting. Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts a little bit.\"\n\nGerman Marquez (9-5) lost for the first time in his past seven starts, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings. Worley gave up three runs in four-plus innings but contributed a two-run single.\n\nJavy Guerra (1-0) earned his first victory since 2014 with two scoreless innings. He protected a two-run lead in the fifth, when he came on with runners at second and third and none out, and escaped without allowing a run.\n\nOdrisamer Despaigne pitched a perfect ninth for his first career save. Manager Don Mattingly said he had limited options in the bullpen because of a recent heavy workload, but four relievers combined for five shutout innings.\n\n\"We were a little light,\" Mattingly said. \"Despaigne was probably our last guy we wanted to use today.\"\n\nSTANTON'S SURGE\n\nStanton lined a 3-2 fastball over the right field fence to make the score 3-all, giving him at least one home run in eight of the past 10 games. He leads the majors in homers, and his 16 since the All-Star break are also the most.\n\n\"There are not that many guys who leave that opposite field that often,\" Mattingly said. \"But as soon as he hits it, you know it's gone.\"\n\nAs Stanton reflected on tying the team home run record, he talked about growing up in Los Angeles and attending Dodgers games when Sheffield played for them after leaving the Marlins.\n\n\"I really enjoyed watching him play as a kid,\" Stanton said. \"Definitely good company to be in. It's not something I'll fully appreciate until the year is over, but it's a cool thing to have under my belt, and I've got time to get more.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: Manager Bud Black returned to the dugout after missing one game because of illness.\n\nMarlins: RHP Kyle Barraclough (right shoulder) will be activated in the next couple of days, Mattingly said.\n\nSEA LEVEL WOES\n\nThe Rockies went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position, and 5 for 39 (.128) in those situations on their five-game trip. The rough weekend is nothing new for the Rockies in Miami, where their record is 35-64.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis will complete his comeback from chemotherapy for testicular cancer by starting Monday night's game in Denver against Atlanta.\n\n\"We're all extremely excited to have him back in a big league uniform,\" Black said. \"He has been through a lot in the past nine or 10 months. It's a great comeback for a guy who is a tremendous human being.\"\n\nMarlins: LHP Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43) is scheduled to start Monday against the San Francisco Giants and LHP Ty Blach (8-7, 4.15).",

The homer was Stanton's 21st in the past 33 games.\n\nIt was the 250th homer of Stanton's career and came in his 941st game. Only five players since 1913 have reached the 250-milestone faster.\n\nRockies All-Star third baseman Nolan Arenado, the major league RBI leader, left the game in the fifth inning after being hit on the left hand by an 88-mph fastball thrown by Vance Worley.\n\nColorado manager Bud Black returned to the dugout after missing one game because of illness.\n\nGerman Marquez (9-5) lost for the first time in his past seven starts, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings. Worley gave up three runs in four-plus innings but contributed a two-run single.\n\nJavy Guerra (1-0) earned his first victory since 2014 with two scoreless innings. He protected a two-run lead in the fifth, when he came on with runners at second and third and none out, and escaped without allowing a run.\n\nOdrisamer Despaigne pitched a perfect ninth for his first career save.\n\nStanton lined a 3-2 pitch over the right field fence to make the score 3-all, giving him at least one home run in eight of the past 10 games. He leads the majors in homers, and his 16 since the All-Star break are also the most.\n\nSEA LEVEL WOES\n\nThe Rockies went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position, and went 5 for 39 (.128) in those situations on their five-game trip.\n\nThe rough weekend is nothing new for the Rockies in Miami, where their all-time record is 35-64.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis will complete his comeback from chemotherapy for testicular cancer by starting Monday night's game in Denver against Atlanta. RHP Julio Teheran (7-10, 5.25) is scheduled to start for the Braves.\n\nMarlins: LHP Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43) is scheduled to start Monday against the San Francisco Giants and LHP Ty Blach (8-7,

Stanton has hit seven home runs in his last eight games to reach the 40-home run plateau for the first time in his eight-year career.\n\nJunichi Tazawa (2-2) tossed a scoreless eighth to earn the victory and Brad Ziegler pitched the ninth to record his third save in six chances. Jake McGee (0-2) took the loss for the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the third on Nolan Arenado two-run home run, his 26th, making him the first player in the majors with 100 RBIs.

Black is considering a trio of right-handers in Chad Bettis, Antonio Senzatela, and Tyler Chatwood.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: OF Ian Desmond (right calf strain) is \"still a ways away\" from beginning a rehab assignment, according to Black. Desmond has been on the disabled list since July 26.\n\nMarlins: 1B Justin Bour (right oblique strain) is progressing with activity, but will not do any baseball-related activity until he is pain-free. . LHP Wei-Yin Chen (arm) is progressing with his throwing program and is scheduled to throw a live batting practice on Saturday. . RHP Kyle Barraclough (shoulder) threw 14 pitches in a GCL rehab assignment game on Thursday and is scheduled to throw one inning for Single-A Jupiter on Saturday. .

Cole, sending it way beyond the wall in left-center for his 38th home run, a career high. After the game, sitting in the top shelf of Stanton's locker was a scuffed-up ball that had the vitals written on it (date, opponent, pitcher) and was torn in two different places, such that there were gaping holes where the white leather meets the red seams. On the one hand, it seemed like an obvious clubhouse prank -- after all, the ball resembled something straight out of \"The Natural.\" On the other hand, the way Stanton's been punishing pitches lately, it's entirely believable that he tore the cover off the ball.\n\nIf the first half of the 2017 season belonged to Aaron Judge, the second half belongs to Stanton. A 6-foot-6, 245-pound specimen who's so jacked that even his muscles have muscles, Stanton was Judge long before Judge was Judge: a supersized position player who looks as if he was genetically engineered in a petri dish for the sole purpose of being a tight end, but somehow got lost on his way to the gridiron. Instead of catching passes, Stanton catches pitches with the barrel of his bat, and obliterates them.\n\nIt's something he's had a penchant for doing ever since he burst onto the scene in 2010, when as a 20-year old rookie he hit 22 home runs in just over half a season. His promise was so immense that following the 2014 season -- when Stanton led the National League in homers and finished second in the MVP balloting -- the Miami Marlins signed the former second-round draft pick to a 13-year, $325 million contract, setting a record for the largest deal in pro sports history. But injuries have prevented him from fulfilling that promise.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, Stanton took an 88 mph fastball square in the face and missed the final three weeks. The following year, he broke a bone in his left hand and missed the final three months. Last season, a groin injury cost him almost a month. This year, for the first time in forever, the mammoth Marlin has managed to stay healthy. By minimizing the damage to himself, he's maximizing the damage to opposing pitchers.\n\n\"He's been on the field all year,\" says manager Don Mattingly, offering the simplest of explanations as to why Stanton, at age 27, is finally putting up the kind of monster numbers that everyone expected.\n\nThrough Aug. 11, the Miami outfielder was leading the majors with 40 bombs. He was on pace for 58 jacks, a number that hasn't been reached since Ryan Howard hit 58 over a decade ago. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Stanton is the first player with 19 home runs in a 31-game span since Braves catcher Javy L\u00f3pez did so in 2003. Stanton's dominant display, coupled with the recent struggles of a certain Yankees rookie, has served as a not-so-subtle reminder that when it comes to supersized sluggers, newer isn't necessarily better.\n\n\"People like new toys,\" says Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon. \"Judge is the new toy for them. But G is one of the best, and they're trying to say he's not one of the best no more because a new kid's come up.\"\n\nAccording to Stanton, not being the new kid is precisely what's helped him find his mojo.\n\n\"Just being a better baseball player,\" says the eight-year vet, explaining what he thinks has been the difference for him this season. \"Not being an athlete and getting away with performance. Just understanding baseball and understanding the grind of it. When I don't feel my best for a couple days, how to get through that with some singles or get on a couple times. Walk. Do something to not get in that slump. That's been the key this year.\"\n\nThat's not the only adjustment that's benefited him.\n\nOn May 23, Mattingly moved Stanton -- who was primarily a middle-of-the-order thumper over his first seven seasons -- to the second spot in the lineup, where he'd previously made just one start in his entire career. Hitting behind the speedy Gordon, Stanton's been seeing more fastballs than ever before, as opposing pitchers are throwing him heaters 53 percent of the time, up from 49 percent before the switch. That 4 percent difference might not seem significant, but when you spread it over the 1,200 pitches that Stanton's seen since late May, it is -- especially when you consider his 8.3 percent home run rate against fastballs (second best in the NL).\n\n\"He getting a lot of heaters, and it's paying off for him,\" says Gordon, who was on base for two of the three homers that Stanton hit during the Nationals series, all of which came on fastballs.\n\nOverall, Stanton has 29 bombs in 67 games since moving to the 2-hole, and his OPS has spiked by more than 200 points, from .859 to 1.074. Not surprisingly, opponents are proceeding with caution.\n\nPrior to moving up in the order, 47.1 percent of the pitches that Stanton saw were in the strike zone, which ranked in the middle of the major league pack. Since the switch, he's seeing just 41.8 percent strikes, the lowest rate among all National League hitters. He's taking what pitchers are giving him, too, as evidenced by the fact that his walk rate has jumped from 10 percent to 13 percent. Although Mattingly didn't discuss selectivity with Stanton before plugging him into the second spot, the Marlins skipper -- a lifetime .307 hitter during his playing days -- did have a conversation with his slugger back in spring training about staying within himself.\n\n\"We did talk about covering areas of the plate that he handles well, and making sure he knew exactly what he handled well.\"\n\nAnd part of knowing what you do well is knowing what you don't do well.\n\nAfter his gruesome beaning in 2014, Stanton understandably backed off the plate and had a tendency to pull off the ball, especially against right-handers. As a result, he had trouble getting to the outside pitch. According to ESPN Stats & Info, in 2015, Stanton's slugging percentage on outer-half offerings from righties was .358, a career worst and 63 points lower than in any of his previous five seasons. Although that number improved to .409 in 2016, he still had a ways to go. No stranger to tinkering with his approach, Stanton started using a pronounced closed stance this season, perhaps in an effort to exorcise his demons and make righties pay for pitching him away.\n\nApparently, it's working. This year, Stanton's slugging percentage on outer-half pitches is all the way up to .542, which puts him just outside the top 10 among National League hitters. In other words, Stanton's turned one of his biggest weaknesses into a strength. As frightening as that thought is for opposing pitchers, it's even scarier for baseballs. Just ask the one that sat in his locker in DC.\n\nOK, so maybe Stanton didn't really tear the cover off the ball in two places. Maybe that alleged 38 home run ball wasn't authentic. Then again, maybe it was.\n\n\"Could be,\" says Stanton when asked if the memento is legit.\n\nStanding in front of his locker, he flashes a wry smile, then walks off toward the showers.", "location":

Black is considering a trio of right-handers in Chad Bettis, Antonio Senzatela, and Tyler Chatwood.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: OF Ian Desmond (right calf strain) is \"still a ways away\" from beginning a rehab assignment, according to Black. Desmond has been on the disabled list since July 26.\n\nMarlins: 1B Justin Bour (right oblique strain) is progressing with activity, but will not do any baseball-related activity until he is pain-free. . LHP Wei-Yin Chen (arm) is progressing with his throwing program and is scheduled to throw a live batting practice on Saturday. . RHP Kyle Barraclough (shoulder) threw 14 pitches in a GCL rehab assignment game on Thursday and is scheduled to throw one inning for Single-A Jupiter on Saturday. . SS JT Riddle (shoulder) had season-ending surgery on Friday to repair a torn labrum.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (6-3, 5.03 ERA) will take the mound in the second game of the series on Saturday. Hoffman is coming off one of his best performances of the season allowing one run and striking out eight over seven innings against Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\nMarlins: LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.31) will make his return to the big leagues for the first time since a relief appearance on June 28 against the Mets.

Watermelon-flavored water, he said.\n\nSo that's the secret?\n\n\"It might be,\" Stanton said. \"I don't know.\"\n\nNo one can really explain his current home run binge, not even Stanton, but it shows no signs of ending. The All-Star slugger reached a couple of milestones Sunday by hitting a homer in his fourth consecutive game, and the Marlins completed their first series sweep of the Colorado Rockies since 2006, winning 5-3.\n\nStanton hit his 42nd homer leading off the third inning to tie Gary Sheffield's team season record set in 1996. It was the 250th homer of Stanton's career and came in his 941st game.\n\nOnly five players since 1913 have reached the 250-milestone faster, and Stanton's pace is accelerating. The homer was his 21st in the past 33 games.\n\n\"There's a lot happening at once,\" Stanton said. \"Just enjoy the ride, and keep it going.\"\n\nStanton made it a long weekend for the Rockies, and their misery was compounded when major league RBI leader Nolan Arenado left the game in the fifth inning with a bruised left hand after being hit by an 88-mph fastball from Vance Worley.\n\nFollowing the game, Arenado said his hand was stiff and swollen, but X-rays were negative. He said he hopes to be sidelined for only a couple of days and is optimistic he can avoid a stint on the disabled list.\n\n\"It hurt real bad,\" the All-Star third baseman said. \"It got real tight. That was my concern -- how tight it was getting. Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts a little bit.\"\n\nGerman Marquez (9-5) lost for the first time in his past seven starts, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings. Worley gave up three runs in four-plus innings but contributed a two-run single.\n\nJavy Guerra (1-0) earned his first victory since 2014 with two scoreless innings. He protected a two-run lead in the fifth, when he came on with runners at second and third and none out, and escaped without allowing a run.\n\nOdrisamer Despaigne pitched a perfect ninth for his first career save. Manager Don Mattingly said he had limited options in the bullpen because of a recent heavy workload, but four relievers combined for five shutout innings.\n\n\"We were a little light,\" Mattingly said. \"Despaigne was probably our last guy we wanted to use today.\"\n\nSTANTON'S SURGE\n\nStanton lined a 3-2 fastball over the right field fence to make the score 3-all, giving him at least one home run in eight of the past 10 games. He leads the majors in homers, and his 16 since the All-Star break are also the most.\n\n\"There are not that many guys who leave that opposite field that often,\" Mattingly said. \"But as soon as he hits it, you know it's gone.\"\n\nAs Stanton reflected on tying the team home run record, he talked about growing up in Los Angeles and attending Dodgers games when Sheffield played for them after leaving the Marlins.\n\n\"I really enjoyed watching him play as a kid,\" Stanton said. \"Definitely good company to be in. It's not something I'll fully appreciate until the year is over, but it's a cool thing to have under my belt, and I've got time to get more.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: Manager Bud Black returned to the dugout after missing one game because of illness.\n\nMarlins: RHP Kyle Barraclough (right shoulder) will be activated in the next couple of days, Mattingly said.\n\nSEA LEVEL WOES\n\nThe Rockies went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position, and 5 for 39 (.128) in those situations on their five-game trip. The rough weekend is nothing new for the Rockies in Miami, where their record is 35-64.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis will complete his comeback from chemotherapy for testicular cancer by starting Monday night's game in Denver against Atlanta.\n\n\"We're all extremely excited to have him back in a big league uniform,\" Black said. \"He has been through a lot in the past nine or 10 months. It's a great comeback for a guy who is a tremendous human being.\"\n\nMarlins: LHP Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43) is scheduled to start Monday against the San Francisco Giants and LHP Ty Blach (8-7,

The third baseman said he didn't think he would have to go on the 10-day disabled list, but he'll probably be out at least a few games.\n\nThe secondary news was bad, too. The Marlins got another home run from the unstoppable Giancarlo Stanton and beat Colorado 5-3 to complete a three-game sweep at Marlins Park. Colorado rookie starter German Marquez did not pitch well and was gone after 4 \u2153 innings.\n\n\"My hand hurts pretty bad, and it also got really tight, and that was my concern,\" Arenado said after the game, his left hand thickly wrapped. \"Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts and it's going to take some time, Hopefully just a couple of days. But it hurts pretty bad right now.\"\n\nSunday's loss was the Rockies' fifth in their last six games, and they fell below .500 on the road for the first time all season, at 30-31. Their grip on a National League wild-card spot, once so strong, is getting weaker by the day.\n\nThe game started out just fine for the Rockies. They took a 3-2 lead in the third on an RBI single by Gerardo Parra and a two-run double by Carlos Gonzalez.\n\nBut the lead didn't last very long.\n\nStanton led off the bottom of the frame with a homer into the right-field corner off Marquez. It was Stanton's 42nd homer, tying him with Gary Sheffield for the Marlins' franchise record. Just as remarkable, it was Stanton's 250th career homer, his 21st in 33 games and ninth in his last 10 games.\n\nPrior to the game, Rockies manager Bud Black talked about the danger of leaving pitches over the plate for Stanton to rip into. Marquez didn't do that. He actually painted the black edge of the plate with a 98 mph fastball, but the muscular Stanton managed to slice it over the wall.\n\n\"It was a good pitch, so you have to give credit to him,\" said Marquez, who fell to 9-5 and saw his ERA rise to 4.13.\n\nYet it wasn't the solo homer that sunk Marquez. Instead, three consecutive Marlins hits in the fourth inning did him in. Singles by Tomas Telis and Miguel Rojas set the table for Mike Aviles' double into the right-field corner, giving Florida a 5-3 lead.\n\nMarquez had been the Rockies' best pitcher for the last month, making six quality starts and going 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA over that span. But on Sunday, he pitched like the 22-year-old rookie that he is, giving up five runs on seven hits. He needed 90 pitches (just 57 strikes) to get into the fifth inning.\n\n\"Overall, there was some fastballs up over the plate that ended up costing him,\" manager Bud Black said.\n\nAdded Marquez: \"Most definitely I agree. The fastball command was not there today, and I just kind of started off slow. I tried to pick it up, but it just wasn't there today.\"\n\nAs has been the case for most of the 1-5, five-game road trip, the Rockies squandered scoring opportunities. They were 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position Sunday and 5-for-39 over the trip.\n\nIn the fifth inning, after Arenado's departure, they had men on second and third with no outs but failed to score a run.\n\nA similar scenario was repeated in the eighth inning. Pat Valaika, starting at shortstop, led off with a single, followed by a single by fellow rookie Ryan McMahon. It was the first hit of McMahon's big-league career.\n\nBut Ryan Hanigan, rather than bunting, grounded into rally-killing double play, and pinch-hitter Mark Reynolds hit a soft roller to short for the final out.\n\n\"Runners in scoring position was tough on this trip, for sure,\" Black said, agreeing that Colorado had too many empty at-bats. \"We just couldn't get the big hit. The Marlins got a couple of key hits when the score was close. It didn't happen for us on this trip.\"", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": null, "time":

Because that's the only way to describe Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton right now. The 27-year-old slugger added to his unbelievable hot streak Sunday, smashing his 250th career home run.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nIn the third inning, Stanton smacked a 97 mph fastball from German M\u00e1rquez to right field for a solo shot to tie the game. The blast was impressive for a number of reasons, and we're going to chronicle all of them below.\n\nIT WAS THE 250TH HOME RUN OF STANTON'S CAREER\n\nAllow us to have some fun with numbers for a minute. Stanton already has 250 career home runs. That ties him with Andruw Jones for 11th most all-time through age-27. That last part is crucial, because Stanton still has over a month left in his age-27 season. With just three more blasts, he would tie Hank Aaron for 10th. With six more, he would tie Juan Gonzalez for ninth. Perhaps most impressively, though, Stanton has managed to reach that level in fewer games than anyone ahead of him. Stanton has played in just 941 career games. Alex Rodriguez, who leads all players in home runs through his age-27 season, did so in 1,275 games.\n\nIT ADDED TO STANTON'S UNBELIEVABLE HOT STREAK\n\nAllow us to sum up Stanton's dominance by grabbing a few tweets.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton has 21 home runs since July 5. The San Francisco Giants have 21 home runs since July 5.\n\n-- Chris Towers (@CTowersCBS) August 13, 2017\n\nGiancarlo Stanton has hit more HR over just his past 30 starts (19) than any player on the Red Sox, Cardinals or Phillies has all season.\n\n-- Andrew Simon (@AndrewSimonMLB) August 12, 2017\n\nComing into Sunday, Stanton is hitting .325/.436/.915, with 20 home runs since July 5. That doesn't include Sunday's stats. Stanton's OPS over those 32 games has been an absurd 1.350. That's exceptionally close to Babe Ruth's 1.359 OPS in 1921. Stanton has been as good as Ruth over his latest stretch.\n\nSTANTON EXTENDED HIS LEAD IN HOME RUNS THIS SEASON\n\nBecause of this recent explosion, Stanton has overtaken New York Yankees rookie Aaron Judge for the home run lead in baseball. Not only that, but he's put impressive distance between the top spot and everyone else. Stanton's home run Sunday gave him 42 on the year. Judge is in second with 35.\n\nHE DID IT IN THE MOST GIANCARLO STANTON WAY POSSIBLE\n\nStanton's 250th career blast wasn't a moonshot, it was a screaming line drive to the opposite field. It's something he's done before. Maybe that's not as impressive as a 500 foot bomb to you, but consider how many major leaguers can do what Stanton just did (and has done multiple times). He has enough raw power to send a line drive out to the opposite field. There may only be two or three current players capable of that type of power. It's a unique skill that rarely has been replicated.

While 227 MLB players have reached that mark, only 12 did it by their age 27 season, according to ESPN. Only Ryan Howard, Ralph Kiner, Harmon Killebrew, Albert Pujols and Juan Gonzalez reached No. 250 faster than Stanton.\n\nAfter Stanton hit his 40th home run of the season Friday, a reporter asked Marlins outfielder Marcell Ozuna how many homers he thought Stanton would finish with in 2017.\n\n\"He can get 70,\" Ozuna said. \"Why not? The way he's going right now?\"\n\nThat would be virtually impossible for Stanton, who would need to hit 28 home runs in the Marlins' last 46 games to reach 70. Then again, he has now hit 21 homers in his last 33 games.\n\nStill, he's on pace to hit 58 home runs.\n\n\"It's been fun,\" Stanton told reporters after the game (via the Miami Herald). \"It's been a fun challenge every night for me. There's sometimes where if (a pitcher) throws his pitch, it's going to get demolished. Can't explain it. As long as I get extension and lift on the ball, it's going to go.\"\n\nThe Marlins beat the Rockies, 5-3, to finish off a three-game sweep of Colorado at Marlins Park. Stanton homered in all three games.\n\nStuds of the Night\n\nIn a key matchup with the rival Yankees, Red Sox lefty Chris Sale performed brilliantly, striking out 12 and yielding only four hits and one earned run in seven innings of work.\n\nRoyals second baseman Whit Merrifield homered, tripled and drove in five runs in K.C.'s 14-6 win over Chicago. He went 3-for-6 at the plate.\n\nDud of the Night\n\nGiants outfielder Jarrett Parker struck out six times and went 0-for-9 against the Nationals in a doubleheader. He stranded five runners in the opener.\n\nHighlights\n\nNicky Delmonico was probably thinking \"home run,\" but Royals center-fielder Alex Gordon was thinking, \"this is the final out.\"\n\nTo end the game!\n\nAlex Gordon makes out like a bandit. https://t.co/c61VjTKB2U pic.twitter.com/BeEAVPimSW -- MLB (@MLB)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nDelino DeShields refused to give up on this ball.\n\n.@LinoDeShields = no fear. pic.twitter.com/bBmGpfAXNv -- MLB (@MLB)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nWhat's Next\n\nBraves (51-63) at Rockies (65-52) 8:40 p.m. ET -- Rockies pitcher Chad Bettis will make his first MLB start since being diagnosed with testicular cancer last November.

The Marlins got another home run from the unstoppable Ginacarlo Stanton and beat Colorado 5-3 to complete a three-game sweep at Marlins Park. Colorado rookie starter German Marquez did not pitch well and was gone after 4 \u2153 innings.\n\nIt was the Rockies' fifth loss in their last six games and they fell below .500 on the road for the first time all season, at 30-31. Their grip on a National League wild-card spot, once so strong, is getting weaker by the day.\n\nThere was no immediate word on the severity of Arenado's injury, but he was in considerable pain and almost immediately left the field and went into the Rockies' clubhouse after getting beaned.\n\nTrevor Story entered the game to pinch run for Arenado.\n\nArenado came into Sunday's game hitting .313 with 26 home runs and a major league-high 100 RBIs.\n\nStanton led off the bottom of the frame with a homer into the right-field corner off Marquez. It was Stanton's 42nd homer, tying him with Gary Sheffield for the Marlins' franchise record. Just as remarkable, it was Stanton's 250th career homer, his 21st in 33 games and ninth in his last 10 games.\n\nPrior to the game, Rockies manager Bud Black talked about the danger of leaving pitches over the plate for Stanton to rip into. Marquez didn't do that. He actually painted the black edge of the plate with a 98 mph fastball, but the muscular Stanton managed to slice it over the wall.\n\nYet it wasn't the solo homer that sunk Marquez, it was three consecutive Marlins hits in the fourth that did him in. Singles by Tomas Telis and Miguel Rojas set the table for Mike Aviles' double into the right-field corner, giving Florida a 5-3 lead.\n\nMarquez had been the Rockies' best pitcher for the last month, making six quality starts and going 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA over that span. But on Sunday, he pitched like the 22-year-old rookie that he is, giving up five runs on seven hits. He needed 90 pitches (just 57 strikes) to get into the fifth inning.\n\nAs has been the case for most of the 1-5, five-game road trip, the Rockies squandered scoring opportunities. In the fifth, after Arenado's departure, the had men on second and third with no outs. They failed to score a run.\n\nA similar scenario was repeated in the eighth. Pat Valaika, starting at shortstop, led off with a single, followed by a single by fellow rookie Ryan McMahon. It was the first hit of McMahon's big-league career.\n\nBut Ryan Hanigan grounded into rally-killing double play and pinch hitter Mark Reynolds hit a soft roller to short for the third out.\n\nThe Rockies were 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position Sunday and 5-for-39 over the five-day road trip.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type":

There is no larger perception drop than from first to second.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 245-pound Stanton now has to look up toward another position player in the game -- the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge. Stanton is also looking up at him on exit-velocity leaderboards.\n\nWhile Stanton has already reached a career-high home-run mark this season, the campaign had been going somewhat under the radar given Judge's remarkable first half. Also, in light of what appeared to be a concerted effort to trade power for contact, Stanton didn't exhibit his trademark power in the early part of the season.\n\nWhile Stanton's average exit velocity of 95.9 mph in 2015 remains a single-season Statcast record -- it's superior to the 95.4 mph mark Judge had recorded as of Sunday -- Stanton's average has dipped to 91.7 mph this season, which \"only\" ranks 10th in the sport according to the Statcast leaderboards at Baseball Savant.\n\nDave wrote about this different version of Stanton, a player who appeared to have made a contact-oriented adjustment. Dave authored that piece in the middle of May. Stanton has continued to evolve in the meantime.\n\nWhat's interesting is that, while Stanton has retained his contact gains as the season has gone along, his power is again Stanton-like. He has a MLB- and career-best 42 homers after homering in eight of his last 10 games, his torrid home-run streak continuing Sunday.\n\nWhat's behind this skill growth? At a time when we tend to see more open stances with leg kicks or at least neutral, parallel-to-the-chalk-lines-of-the-box starting positions, Stanton now has one of the more extreme closed batting stances in the game.\n\nConsider Stanton's evolution over the course of June.\n\nOn June 1st, Stanton had a relatively neutral setup.\n\nOn June 13th, he had basically the same starting position with his feet.\n\nBut by June 19th we start to see him closing off his stance:\n\nHe seemed to continue to close off the stance. Consider, for example, this photographic evidence from June 29th:\n\nAnd during his torrid August, the 27-year-old continues to be even more extreme in his closed setup.\n\nWhat is he trying to do? I suspect Mitch Custer of the SB Nation blog Fish Stripes is on to something.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton is a big man. Stanton doesn't have to swing as hard as the average mortal man to make the ball fly out of the yard. With that being said, Stanton's Achilles heel has been located in his front shoulder. In what I can only assume to be his steadfast attempt to hit a ball through the operable glass wall in the left field of Marlins Park, Giancarlo has historically had the tendency to over-swing, peeling his front shoulder out prematurely, and removing his bat barrel from the hitting zone in attempt to pull the baseball. When Giancarlo is peeling his shoulder out, he is prone to strike out on any given slider.\n\nJust as a player like Bryce Harper dropped from 100% to 80% effort in his swing and enjoyed greater success, it makes sense that a player with Stanton's sort of power might find a greater level of efficiency by sacrificing 470-foot home runs for 400-foot homers and more contact. The chase-type breaking balls, mostly sliders, have baffled Stanton throughout his career, and he has begun to make some strides against it this season.\n\nConsider his breaking-ball and overall whiff rates, from Brooks Baseball:\n\nBut even with this extremely closed off stance, Stanton's power is beginning to surge. And, he can still hit 477-foot home runs with a closed stance.\n\nStanton has made significant improvement. He's cut his strikeout rate by roughly six percentage points from last season, to a career-low 23.9%. But his isolated power rests at a career-best mark of .354, which is well above his career average rate of .283 and just one point of his best mark for a season of .341, which he set back in 2015. His .635 slugging mark would also be a career best. He's already reached a career best in home runs, as noted above.\n\nWhat seemed to be a more contact-oriented version of Stanton is, all of the sudden, not trading in any power for contact.\n\nPrivate swing instructor Bobby Tewksbary wrote about how the closed stance might be helping Stanton.\n\nStanton has always been a classic Pull Pattern hitter. This means he'll create separation between his hips and shoulders, but his hands would come forward with his shoulders. He would close off in his stride, but he wasn't able to delay the hands. This new setup is creating a whole new \"environment\" for him. I would imagine he FEELS closed in his stance. And because of this, he has a new feel of how he can get open. Instead of closing in with the stride as his load, he can now use his shoulder alignment/tilt movement as part of his load.\n\nStanton really appears to be up to something. Consider that his power increase has coincided with consolidating the contact improvement he has made, his strikeout rate remains about 23% since July 1, a period of time over which he's recorded a .304/.411/.826 line. That combination of contact and power is rare.\n\nAnd he's doing something else, too: he's become more of a fly-ball hitter in the second half, hitting just 34.2% of his batted balls on the ground and smashing 43.2% of his air balls for home runs.\n\nSo while the world was focused on Judge, Stanton was making adjustments in his shadow and perhaps he is ready to step from it and challenge again for status as the game's most formidable and imposing slugger -- while also becoming a better hitter.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2103, "textStart": 2095, "amb": false, "date": "-06-01"}, {"textEnd": 2158, "textStart": 2149, "amb": false, "date": "-06-13"}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 2236, "textStart": 2227, "amb": false, "date": "2017-06-19"}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 2393, "textStart": 2384, "amb": false, "date": "2017-06-29"}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 5322, "textStart": 5316, "amb": false, "date": "2017-07-01"}], "time": "14:11:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "14:11:00", "title": "  Giancarlo Stanton Is Closing Off and Trending Up | FanGraphs Baseball", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709266304", "image": "http://cdn.fangraphs.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-11-at-12.32.56-PM.png", "source": {"title": "fangraphs.com", "uri": "fangraphs.com", "id": "64"}, "id": "9094607", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "wgt": 100, "id": 3}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100, "id": 223}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 466}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 100, "id": 777}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100, "id": 947}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 100, "id": 1038}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303573", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303711", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "label": {"eng": "Blog"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305393", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305786", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305791", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_statistics", "label": {"eng": "Baseball statistics"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310534", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310537", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_9_innings_pitched", "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per 9 innings pitched"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310550", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider", "label": {"eng": "Slider"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310593", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles'_heel", "label": {"eng": "Achilles' heel"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312742", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314692", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlins_Park", "label": {"eng": "Marlins Park"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322745", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(B)", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (B)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325672", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334415", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}, "type": "person", "id": "350078", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "402053", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_(music)", "label": {"eng": "Stride (music)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438042", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1297021", "score": 5}]}

The third baseman said he didn't think he would have to go on the 10-day disabled list, but he'll probably be out at least a few games.\n\nThe secondary news was bad, too.\n\nThe Marlins got another home run from the unstoppable Giancarlo Stanton and beat Colorado 5-3 to complete a three-game sweep at Marlins Park. Colorado rookie starter German Marquez did not pitch well and was gone after 4 \u2153 innings.\n\n\"My hand hurts pretty bad, and it also got really tight, and that was my concern,\" Arenado said after the game, his left hand thickly wrapped. \"Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts and it's going to take some time, Hopefully just a couple of days. But it hurts pretty bad right now.\"\n\nSunday's loss was the Rockies' fifth in their last six games, and they fell below .500 on the road for the first time all season, at 30-31. Their grip on a National League wild-card spot, once so strong, is getting weaker by the day.\n\nThe game started out just fine for the Rockies. They took a 3-2 lead in the third on an RBI single by Gerardo Parra and a two-run double by Carlos Gonzalez.\n\nBut the lead didn't last very long.\n\nStanton led off the bottom of the frame with a homer into the right-field corner off Marquez. It was Stanton's 42nd homer, tying him with Gary Sheffield for the Marlins' franchise record. Just as remarkable, it was Stanton's 250th career homer, his 21st in 33 games and ninth in his last 10 games.\n\nPrior to the game, Rockies manager Bud Black talked about the danger of leaving pitches over the plate for Stanton to rip into. Marquez didn't do that. He actually painted the black edge of the plate with a 98 mph fastball, but the muscular Stanton managed to slice it over the wall.\n\n\"It was a good pitch, so you have to give credit to him,\" said Marquez, who fell to 9-5 and saw his ERA rise to 4.13.\n\nYet it wasn't the solo homer that sunk Marquez. Instead, three consecutive Marlins hits in the fourth inning did him in. Singles by Tomas Telis and Miguel Rojas set the table for Mike Aviles' double into the right-field corner, giving Florida a 5-3 lead.\n\nMarquez had been the Rockies' best pitcher for the last month, making six quality starts and going 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA over that span. But on Sunday, he pitched like the 22-year-old rookie that he is, giving up five runs on seven hits. He needed 90 pitches (just 57 strikes) to get into the fifth inning.\n\n\"Overall, there was some fastballs up over the plate that ended up costing him,\" manager Bud Black said.\n\nAdded Marquez: \"Most definitely I agree. The fastball command was not there today, and I just kind of started off slow. I tried to pick it up, but it just wasn't there today.\"\n\nAs has been the case for most of the 1-5, five-game road trip, the Rockies squandered scoring opportunities. They were 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position Sunday and 5-for-39 over the trip.\n\nIn the fifth inning, after Arenado's departure, they had men on second and third with no outs but failed to score a run.\n\nA similar scenario was repeated in the eighth inning. Pat Valaika, starting at shortstop, led off with a single, followed by a single by fellow rookie Ryan McMahon. It was the first hit of McMahon's big-league career.\n\nBut Ryan Hanigan, rather than bunting, grounded into rally-killing double play, and pinch-hitter Mark Reynolds hit a soft roller to short for the final out.\n\n\"Runners in scoring position was tough on this trip, for sure,\" Black said, agreeing that Colorado had too many empty at-bats. \"We just couldn't get the big hit. The Marlins got a couple of key hits when the score was close. It didn't happen for us on this trip.\"", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": null, "time":

The third baseman said he didn't think he would have to go on the 10-day disabled list, but he'll probably be out at least a few games.\n\nThe secondary news was bad, too.\n\nThe Marlins got another home run from the unstoppable Giancarlo Stanton and beat Colorado 5-3 to complete a three-game sweep at Marlins Park. Colorado rookie starter German Marquez did not pitch well and was gone after 4 \u2153 innings.\n\n\"My hand hurts pretty bad, and it also got really tight, and that was my concern,\" Arenado said after the game, his left hand thickly wrapped. \"Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts and it's going to take some time, Hopefully just a couple of days. But it hurts pretty bad right now.\"\n\nSunday's loss was the Rockies' fifth in their last six games, and they fell below .500 on the road for the first time all season, at 30-31. Their grip on a National League wild-card spot, once so strong, is getting weaker by the day.\n\nThe game started out just fine for the Rockies. They took a 3-2 lead in the third on an RBI single by Gerardo Parra and a two-run double by Carlos Gonzalez.\n\nBut the lead didn't last very long.\n\nStanton led off the bottom of the frame with a homer into the right-field corner off Marquez. It was Stanton's 42nd homer, tying him with Gary Sheffield for the Marlins' franchise record. Just as remarkable, it was Stanton's 250th career homer, his 21st in 33 games and ninth in his last 10 games.\n\nPrior to the game, Rockies manager Bud Black talked about the danger of leaving pitches over the plate for Stanton to rip into. Marquez didn't do that. He actually painted the black edge of the plate with a 98 mph fastball, but the muscular Stanton managed to slice it over the wall.\n\n\"It was a good pitch, so you have to give credit to him,\" said Marquez, who fell to 9-5 and saw his ERA rise to 4.13.\n\nYet it wasn't the solo homer that sunk Marquez. Instead, three consecutive Marlins hits in the fourth inning did him in. Singles by Tomas Telis and Miguel Rojas set the table for Mike Aviles' double into the right-field corner, giving Florida a 5-3 lead.\n\nMarquez had been the Rockies' best pitcher for the last month, making six quality starts and going 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA over that span. But on Sunday, he pitched like the 22-year-old rookie that he is, giving up five runs on seven hits. He needed 90 pitches (just 57 strikes) to get into the fifth inning.\n\n\"Overall, there was some fastballs up over the plate that ended up costing him,\" manager Bud Black said.\n\nAdded Marquez: \"Most definitely I agree. The fastball command was not there today, and I just kind of started off slow. I tried to pick it up, but it just wasn't there today.\"", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"},

Black is considering a trio of right-handers in Chad Bettis, Antonio Senzatela, and Tyler Chatwood.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: OF Ian Desmond (right calf strain) is \"still a ways away\" from beginning a rehab assignment, according to Black. Desmond has been on the disabled list since July 26.\n\nMarlins: 1B Justin Bour (right oblique strain) is progressing with activity, but will not do any baseball-related activity until he is pain-free. . LHP Wei-Yin Chen (arm) is progressing with his throwing program and is scheduled to throw a live batting practice on Saturday. . RHP Kyle Barraclough (shoulder) threw 14 pitches in a GCL rehab assignment game on Thursday and is scheduled to throw one inning for Single-A Jupiter on Saturday. . SS JT Riddle (shoulder) had season-ending surgery on Friday to repair a torn labrum.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (6-3, 5.03 ERA) will take the mound in the second game of the series on Saturday. Hoffman is coming off one of his best performances of the season allowing one run and striking out eight over seven innings against Philadelphia on Sunday.\n\nMarlins: LHP Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.31) will make his return to the big leagues for the first time since a relief appearance on June 28 against the Mets.

WATCH IT LIVE ON FOX SPORTS GO\n\nMIAMI -- The Colorado Rockies still lead the National League wild-card race, but they are in danger of getting swept by the Miami Marlins on Sunday.\n\nMiami right fielder Giancarlo Stanton, who has homered in each of the first two games of this series, is making things miserable for the Rockies (65-51), who have lost four of their past five games overall.\n\nWatch the Miami Marlins on FOX Sports Florida Broadcast scheduleFOX Sports GoVIDEO: Marlins news, interviews & exclusive featuresMarlins Clubhouse\n\nStanton leads the majors with 41 homers, and his Marlins (55-60), while realistically out of playoff contention, have been playing good baseball lately. In fact, the Marlins have won five of their past seven series, including a series victory over the first-place Washington Nationals.\n\nAs for the 6-foot-6, 250-pound Stanton, virtually everyone is impressed with what he is accomplishing, including Rockies bench coach Mike Redmond, who used to be his manager with the Marlins.\n\n\"I had him for a few years, and nobody hits the ball harder than he does,\" Redmond said. \"When he's going good, you have to be really careful.\n\n\"The last couple of days, we just haven't executed good enough pitches to get him out.\"\n\nRockies right-hander German Marquez (9-4, 3.88 ERA) has the unenviable task of trying to get Stanton out on Sunday.\n\nMarquez is set to make his 20th start of the season against the Marlins, a team he has never faced. He has made six straight quality starts, a record for a Rockies rookie. And in those six starts, he is 4-0 with a 2.95 ERA, 41 strikeouts and 10 walks in 39 innings.\n\nMiami will counter with right-hander Vance Worley (2-2, 4.82 ERA). In three career appearances against Colorado, Worley is 1-1 with a 2.45 ERA, but he has not faced the Rockies since 2012.\n\nBut the big story continues to be Stanton, who went 3-for-4 with three RBIs and two runs scored on Saturday. He fell a triple short of the cycle and has 20 homers in his past 32 games.\n\nStanton is one homer short of the Marlins' season franchise record set by Gary Sheffield in 1996.\n\nFurthermore, since 2000, only two players -- David Ortiz in 2006 and Chris Davis in 2013 -- have reached 40 homers quicker than Stanton, who accomplished the feat on Friday.\n\n\"It's been fun,\" Stanton said of the groove he is in lately. \"It's been fun downloading info on the pitchers. The daily preparation has been fun.\n\n\"You can never expect that every time a pitcher throws a pitch it will get demolished. But as long as I get extension, and I get lift on a ball, it's going to go.\"\n\nMarlins manager Don Mattingly said he thinks that pitchers, during this Stanton hot streak, are afraid to make mistakes against him, and that fear has backfired.\n\n\"Pitchers are trying to make (perfect) pitches, and sometimes they hold on to it too long and don't want to do this or don't want to do that.\n\n\"(As a result,) they are leaving some stuff there to hit. And (Stanton) is not missing.\"\n\nThe Rockies have an incredibly dangerous lineup that features major-league RBIs leader Nolan Arenado, All-Star leadoff batter Charlie Blackmon, who went 4-for-5 with two steals and two runs scored on Saturday; Mark Reynolds, who has 23 homers; Gerardo Parra, who is hitting .343; Trevor Story, who has 15 homers; two-time All-Star catcher Jonathan Lucroy; and 2016 NL batting champ D.J. LeMahieu.\n\nMiami, on the other hand, has a red-hot Stanton. And, right now, that's enough.\n\n\"Every time he comes up to bat, it's a game-changer,\" Marlins pitcher Justin Nicolino said Saturday after picking up his first win of the season. \"I'm glad I don't have to face him. He is locked in right now.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "14:05:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {"liCnt": 4}, "timeCrawl": "14:05:00", "title": "Colorado Rockies at

This one had Marlins and MLB significance, too.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton hit his 42nd homer of the season on Sunday, his ninth dinger in 12 August games, and the 21st homer he's hit over his last 33 contests. It, like every homer Stanton hits the rest of 2017, set a new career-high for him, and also tied him with Gary Sheffield's tremendous 1996 for the most dingers in a single season in Marlins history.\n\nAnd none of that, amazingly, is the most impressive part of Stanton's 42nd homer. That's because it was also the 250th of his career, and while 250 isn't a number you see celebrated all that often, the way Stanton got there is special, historically speaking.\n\nAccording to Baseball Reference's Play Index tool, Stanton is one of just 12 players in the history of baseball to have at least 250 career homers during their age-27 season. Seasonal age is determined by a player's age as of June 30, so some of these players might have hit number 250 while they were actually 28, and some had hit 250 well before 27, but what matters is that Stanton is a member of this elite group.\n\nLook at that list! Alex Rodriguez has way more homers before his age-27 season ended than Stanton will, but he also started his career two years earlier and is Alex Rodriguez. Jimmie Foxx began three years sooner than Stanton did. Foxx, Eddie Mathews, Ken Griffey Jr., Mickey Mantle, Mel Ott, Frank Robinson, and Hank Aaron are already all Hall of Famers. A-Rod and Albert Pujols will join them someday. Juan Gonzalez might have had a shot, but his career was over before he really got into his mid-30s, and the same goes for Andruw Jones, whose career after 27 was nothing compared to what came before then.\n\nSeven Hall of Famers, and two more likely to join them. Gonzalez never had the glove and didn't stick around long enough to compile the offensive numbers, but what he packed into his career is damn impressive. As for Jones, he honestly might be a Hall of Famer, anyway: There's a pretty easy argument to make that he's better than Jim Rice or at least as good as Andre Dawson, if you're looking for recent comparables.\n\nOf course, we're talking about Stanton, so we won't get too far into that. But these are the people Stanton now has as company, and it's a ridiculous list. And somehow, this is what Stanton managed to achieve in spite of all of the injuries, in spite of averaging just 121 games per year from his first full season through 2016.\n\nMaking it to 250 is impressive enough: Just 227 of over 10,000 hitters in history have accomplished even that in their careers. Making it to 250 homers before a players' age-28 season, though, is some real rarefied territory, and history suggests there are a whole lot more dingers to come from Stanton.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 223, "textStart": 214, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12"}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 979, "textStart": 972, "amb": false, "date": "2017-06-30"}], "time": "14:26:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "14:51:00", "title": "Giancarlo Stanton's 250th homer put him in select, historic company", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709285613", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkHbmr4ojngxOdYMON6zrFy38RU=/0x234:3000x1922/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56180261/831075358.0.jpg", "source": {"title": "SB Nation", "uri": "sbnation.com", "id": "962"}, "id": "9102336", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100, "id": 223}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment", "wgt": 100, "id": 278}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100, "id": 448}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 100, "id": 523}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100, "id": 566}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100, "id": 947}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 100, "id": 948}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Greek", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Greek", "wgt": 100, "id": 1545}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302624", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303573", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303711", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305786", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305791", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}, "type": "org", "id": "310673", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312739", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pujols", "label": {"eng": "Albert Pujols"}, "type": "person", "id": "315353", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez", "label": {"eng": "Alex Rodriguez"}, "type": "person", "id": "339734", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(D)", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (D)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "361271", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Ott", "label": {"eng": "Mel Ott"}, "type": "person", "id": "367046", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "402053", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron", "label": {"eng": "Hank Aaron"}, "type": "person", "id": "413288", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Foxx", "label": {"eng": "Jimmie Foxx"}, "type": "person", "id": "432496", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Robinson", "label": {"eng": "Frank Robinson"}, "type": "person", "id": "432497", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mantle", "label": {"eng": "Mickey Mantle"}, "type": "person", "id": "432498", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andruw_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Andruw Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "435785", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Sheffield", "label": {"eng": "Gary Sheffield"}, "type": "person", "id": "530805", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rice", "label": {"eng": "Jim Rice"}, "type": "person", "id": "536280", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Dawson", "label": {"eng": "Andre Dawson"}, "type": "person", "id": "562292", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Mathews", "label": {"eng": "Eddie Mathews"}, "type": "person", "id": "764989", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Griffey_Jr.", "label": {"eng": "Ken Griffey Jr."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1275821", "score": 2}]}

Stanton was poised to become a household name -- at least, as much as anyone ever becomes a household name in the star-starved (and happy about it) MLB.\n\nAfter that season, however, two things changed: he signed a huge contract with the Miami Marlins worth $325 million, and he started getting hurt even more often.\n\nStanton has never been a picture of health. In his seven previous seasons in the league, he has broken 140 games played only twice and has averaged only 118 games played per season. It's minor injuries -- nicks and bumps and the like -- that usually nag at Stanton and keep him out of the lineup for short periods of time, but a particularly gruesome beaning in 2015 robbed him of more than half his season, ending his year in late June.\n\nWhen Stanton returned to the field in 2016, it was hard to avoid noticing that his .815 OPS, while not bad per se, was well below where he had been hitting the previous four seasons.\n\nFairly or not, that would have been more forgivable to fans and writers if he were not in the second year of one of the biggest contracts in MLB history. This is something that's going to loom over him for the rest of his career, and it had a lot of people tut-tutting and hand wringing about how bad the deal was if this was who Stanton was moving forward. And to be sure, even though $9 million wasn't a horrible salary for an outfielder putting up a 119 OPS+ (essentially a Jay Bruce level of production), people were right to be leery of a huge injury followed by a shaky comeback the year after so early in a megadeal.\n\n(Photo by Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire)\n\nMost of those questions have been emphatically laid to rest in 2017. Stanton leads MLB with 41 home runs in mid-August, giving him an outside shot at 60 homers with 47 games remaining. His 41 homers in 115 games (Stanton has missed only two) puts him on track for somewhere between 56 and 58. The 60 milestone won't be a problem if his hot bat gets even a little bit hotter.\n\nThe most important thing is Stanton is once again leading all of baseball with a .621 slugging percentage going into the last leg of the season. One of the biggest problems with his performance last year was his slugging dipping from a career average of .547 going into 2016 down to .489. Part of this was because he hit fewer home runs and doubles than he was accustomed to, but another big part was simply fewer hits in general.\n\nThe Marlins slugger is showing what he can do now that he's finally healthy again, and if he manages to play 157-160 games this year as he's on track to do, he'll put himself in excellent position to be in the MVP discussion with the Washington Nationals' Bryce Harper, Los Angeles Dodgers' Corey Seager and Arizona Diamondbacks' Paul Goldschmidt.\n\nStanton won't ever get his rising star legacy back -- he'll be 28 next year, so he's aging rapidly through his peak years and into veteran territory -- and there will always be a section of the baseball community that won't be able to see past the size and scope of his contract. But Stanton is finally back, and with the Marlins being sold and the dinger machine possibly removed from the outfield stands, that's a piece of good news both Miami and Major League Baseball could use.\n\nMore Coverage: Murray | Could Jeter's agent join Marlins management?

The Rockies announced that manager Bud Black missed the game because he was \"under the weather.\"\n\nRedmon is expected to return Sunday as Miami (55-60) goes for the series sweep against Colorado (65-51), which has lost four of its past five games.\n\nStanton has 41 homers, one short of the franchise season record set by Gary Sheffield in 1996. Stanton has 20 homers in the past 32 games.\n\nThe homer by Stanton snapped a 1-1 tie in the fourth inning. Overall, Stanton went 3-for-4 with three RBIs and two runs scored, falling just a triple short of a cycle.\n\nCenter fielder Charlie Blackmon led Colorado with four hits and two steals. He led off an inning five times and went 4-for-5, with Marlins first baseman Tyler Moore robbing him of a hit on his final at-bat in the ninth.\n\nMiami's Justin Nicolino (1-1) allowed six hits, four walks and two runs (one earned) in 5 1/3 innings. He posted his first win at Marlins Park since May 3, 2016.\n\nJeff Hoffman (6-4) took the loss, allowing seven hits, three walks and four runs. He is winless in his past five appearances, including three losses.\n\nBoth teams scored in the first inning.\n\nBlackmon led off the game with a single, stole second, advanced to third on a flyout and scored on Mark Reynolds RBI single to give Colorado a 1-0 lead.\n\nMiami tied the score 1-1 when Stanton doubled, advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on Marcell Ozuna's groundout.\n\nAfter Stanton's two-out homer gave Miami a 4-1 lead, Colorado got one run back. Blackmon singled and stole second base again, advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher J.T. Realmuto and scored on DJ LeMahieu's sacrifice fly.\n\nColorado cut its deficit to 4-3 in the eighth. Reynolds drew a five-pitch walk, advanced to third on a Jonathan Lucroy single and score on a Carlos Gonzalez groundout. Pinch-hitter Ryan McMahon, making his major-league debut, flied out to the edge of the warning track in center, ending the threat.\n\nBrad Ziegler, who escaped a two-on jam, pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.\n\nNOTES: Colorado signed 1B Ryan Howard, 37, to a minor-league contract. Howard, who twice led the majors in homers, had been out of baseball since being released by the Atlanta Braves on May 8. ... Since 2000, only two players -- David Ortiz in 2006 and Chris Davis in 2013 -- have reached 40 homers quicker than Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton, who accomplished the feat on Friday. ... When rosters can expand to up to 40 players on Sept. 1, look for the Marlins to promote 3B Brian Anderson, who is hitting .267 with 20 homers and 72 RBIs this year between Double-A and Triple-A. ... Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado and CF Charlie Blackmon rank 1-2 in the majors in extra-base hits. In baseball history, teammates have finished 1-2 in the majors in extra-base hits just three times: Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1926 and 1927 and Tony Armas and Dwight Evans for the 1984 Boston Red

Basketball legend Michael Jordan is also one of the investors in Jeter's group.\n\nColorado starter German Marquez (9-5) took the loss after he gave up five runs on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings, while the Rockies dropped into a tie with the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League Wild Card lead with identical 65-52 marks.

That's a 103-home run pace if he were to play 162 games.\n\nHe also has nine home runs in his last 10 games.\n\nIt's the fourth straight game with a home run for Stanton, the second such streak for his career. It's the second-longest streak this season behind Eric Thames' five straight from April 13-17.\n\nThe history\n\nStanton tied Gary Sheffield's club record for home runs in a season with his 42nd home run. Sheffield set the mark in 1996.\n\nStanton is the fifth player in the last 20 seasons to hit at least 21 home runs within a 33-game span, the first since Shawn Green hit 21 home runs for the Dodgers in 2002. The others in that group are Barry Bonds (24 for the 2001 Giants), Mark McGwire (22 for the 1999 Cardinals, McGwire (21 for the 1998 Cardinals) and Sammy Sosa (25 for the 1998 Cubs).\n\nThe home run was a milestone for Stanton, the 250th of his career. He is the sixth-quickest to 250 home runs, doing so in 941 games.\n\nThe five who got their faster are Ryan Howard (855), Hall-of-Famers Ralph Kiner (871) and Harmon Killebrew (905), Albert Pujols (933) and Juan Gonzalez (936).\n\nStanton is also one of 15 players to hit 250 home runs within his first eight seasons. The player he's tied with in that stat is a notable one - baseball legend Willie Mays.\n\nHow he's doing it\n\nEddie Matz detailed the improvements that Stanton has made in reaching the outside pitch (with help from a closed batting stance) and that was evident on Sunday. Stanton had backed away from the plate after being hit in the face in 2014.\n\nThe next two seasons, he struggled to each outside pitches. But in 2017, he's found something that works for him. He now has 15 home runs on outer-third pitches from right-handed pitchers this season, matching the most he's had in any season. He's hitting .277 against those pitches, up from .179 in 2015 and .222 in 2016.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "-04-17", "textEnd": 363, "textStart": 352, "amb": false, "date": "-04-13"}], "time": "03:53:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "03:53:00", "title": "Giancarlo Stanton doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709014248", "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0813%2Fr243926_800x450_16%2D9.jpg", "source": {"title": "ESPN.com", "uri": "espn.com", "id": "4"}, "id": "8999776", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100, "id": 385}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 100, "id": 933}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "id": "84180", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303711", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304985", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305786", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305791", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310538", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312739", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pujols", "label": {"eng": "Albert Pujols"}, "type": "person", "id": "315353", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "319493", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}, "type": "org", "id": "322749", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}, "type": "person", "id": "341541", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Sosa", "label": {"eng": "Sammy Sosa"}, "type": "person", "id": "375952", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McGwire", "label": {"eng": "Mark McGwire"}, "type": "person", "id": "375955", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "402053", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Howard", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Howard"}, "type": "person", "id": "407905", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds", "label": {"eng": "Barry Bonds"}, "type": "person", "id": "419675", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmon_Killebrew", "label": {"eng": "Harmon Killebrew"}, "type": "person", "id": "481570", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Sheffield", "label": {"eng": "Gary Sheffield"}, "type": "person", "id": "530805", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Green", "label": {"eng": "Shawn Green"}, "type": "person", "id": "530806", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kiner", "label": {"eng": "Ralph Kiner"}, "type": "person", "id": "791895", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Thames", "label": {"eng": "Eric Thames"}, "type": "person", "id": "933639", "score": 3}]}

But it's hard to talk about the whole situation because I have not been informed by anyone above me.\"\n\nThe ownership group, led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman and former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, reportedly made the deal to buy out Jeffrey Loria, a transaction that burned up the Internet on Friday afternoon.\n\nLater that night, Stanton hit his 40th homer of the season -- which leads the majors and certainly gives those owners hope that he can soon be the centerpiece of a championship team.\n\nFor the moment, the Marlins (54-60) are out of playoff contention, even after rallying to defeat the Rockies on Friday night.\n\nThe Rockies (65-50) will try to take the second game of the series on Saturday night.\n\nColorado will once again be led by Gold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado, an All-Star who leads the majors with 100 RBIs and 66 extra-base hits.\n\n\"He's having a great year,\" Rockies manager Bud Black said of Arenado, who hit his 26th homer on Friday. \"He is one of the best players in the game. There's a consistency to his game.\"\n\nMiami will start left-hander Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.31 ERA) on Saturday, which will be his first career appearance against Colorado.\n\nNicolino will make his seventh appearance with the Marlins this year, including his sixth start. NIcolino has had various chances in the past three years to grab a rotation job, but he has failed each time. His career record is 8-11 with a 4.61 ERA.\n\nColorado will counter with right-hander Jeff Hoffman (6-3, 5.03 ERA), who will make his first career start against the Marlins. He has been better on the road than at home this season. Away from the high altitude in Colorado, he is 4-1 with a 3.65 ERA in six starts.\n\nHoffman will face a difficult Marlins lineup that has clicked since Stanton was moved to second in the batting order on May 23. Since that date, Stanton is batting .290 with 29 homers and 56 RBIs in 67 starts.\n\nIn addition to Arenado, Colorado's offense is powered by center fielder Charlie Blackmon, who leads the majors in runs (103), triples (13), multi-hit games (50) and total bases (289).\n\nHe also leads the NL with 155 hits.\n\nBlackmon ranks second in the NL with 65 extra-base hits, trailing Arenado by one.\n\nIn baseball history, teammates have finished 1-2 in the majors in extra-base hits just three times: Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1926 and 1927, and Tony Armas and Dwight Evans for the 1984 Boston Red Sox.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2272, "textStart": 2266, "amb":

Stanton has now homered in four straight games as he tied Gary Sheffield for the franchise record for home runs in a season. Sheffield achieved the feat in 1996. Stanton also reached a career milestone with his 250th homer in 941 games -- the sixth-fastest player to reach the plateau -- behind Ryan Howard (855 games), Ralph Kiner (871 games), Harmon Killebrew (905 games), Albert Pujols (933 games) and Juan Gonzalez (936 games).\n\n\"Its been amazing to watch, but it was also good to get production from some guys we don't really count on,\" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said after the game.\n\nMike Aviles added a two-run double while the Marlins' bullpen combined for five scoreless frames as they improved to 56-60. Vance Worley allowed three runs on eight hits with two walks and a strikeout. Javy Guerra (1-0) earned the win after throwing two scoreless frames. Brian Ellington and Junichi Tazawa each tossed a scoreless inning before Odrisamer Despaigne threw a perfect ninth inning for his first Major League save.\n\nThe three-game sweep was Miami's first since July 7-9 against the San Francisco Giants. It was also their first home sweep since beating the Philadelphia Phillies in May. The sweep came days after the Marlins were sold to a new ownership group. According to the New York Times, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria sold the team for $1.7 billion to a group that includes former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and New York businessman Bruce Sherman.\n\nThe deal is expected to be finalized in October. Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald said that Sherman will serve as the control person while Jeter will run the business and baseball side of the organization when the deal becomes official. Basketball legend Michael Jordan is also one of the investors in Jeter's group.\n\nColorado starter German Marquez (9-5) took the loss after he gave up five runs on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings, while the Rockies dropped into a tie with the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League Wild Card lead with identical 65-52 marks. The Rockies also had a scare in the fifth inning after All-Star third baseman Nolan Arenado was hit by Worley's pitch on the left hand. According to Rockies manager Bud Black, Arenado suffered a left hand contusion.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1338, "imp": true, "textEnd": 1346, "date": "2017-07-07",

But it's hard to talk about the whole situation because I have not been informed by anyone above me.\"\n\nThe ownership group, led by venture capitalist Bruce Sherman and former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, reportedly made the deal to buy out Jeffrey Loria, a transaction that burned up the Internet on Friday afternoon.\n\nLater that night, Stanton hit his 40th homer of the season -- which leads the majors and certainly gives those owners hope that he can soon be the centerpiece of a championship team.\n\nFor the moment, the Marlins (54-60) are out of playoff contention, even after rallying to defeat the Rockies on Friday night.\n\nThe Rockies (65-50) will try to take the second game of the series on Saturday night.\n\nColorado will once again be led by Gold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado, an All-Star who leads the majors with 100 RBIs and 66 extra-base hits.\n\n\"He's having a great year,\" Rockies manager Bud Black said of Arenado, who hit his 26th homer on Friday. \"He is one of the best players in the game. There's a consistency to his game.\"\n\nMiami will start left-hander Justin Nicolino (0-1, 5.31 ERA) on Saturday, which will be his first career appearance against Colorado.\n\nNicolino will make his seventh appearance with the Marlins this year, including his sixth start. NIcolino has had various chances in the past three years to grab a rotation job, but he has failed each time. His career record is 8-11 with a 4.61 ERA.\n\nColorado will counter with right-hander Jeff Hoffman (6-3, 5.03 ERA), who will make his first career start against the Marlins. He has been better on the road than at home this season. Away from the high altitude in Colorado, he is 4-1 with a 3.65 ERA in six starts.\n\nHoffman will face a difficult Marlins lineup that has clicked since Stanton was moved to second in the batting order on May 23. Since that date, Stanton is batting .290 with 29 homers and 56 RBIs in 67 starts.\n\nIn addition to Arenado, Colorado's offense is powered by center fielder Charlie Blackmon, who leads the majors in runs (103), triples (13), multi-hit games (50) and total bases (289).\n\nHe also leads the NL with 155 hits.\n\nBlackmon ranks second in the NL with 65 extra-base hits, trailing Arenado by one.\n\nIn

The home run was also the 250th of his career and gave him 21 over his past 33 games.\n\nIn terms of his 941 total games played, Stanton became the sixth-fastest player to reach 250 homers, trailing only Ryan Howard, Ralph Kiner, Harmon Killebrew, Albert Pujols and Juan Gonzalez.\n\n\"It's been fun,\" Stanton said of his historic power surge. \"It's been a fun challenge every night for me. There's sometimes where if (a pitcher) throws his pitch, it's going to get demolished. Can't explain it. As long as I get extension and lift on the ball, it's going to go.\"\n\nStanton is on pace not only to shatter Sheffield's record, but surpass the 50- homer benchmark. The Marlins still have 46 games remaining.\n\nSheffield said he's surprised Stanton -- or some other Marlin through the years -- hadn't already broken his record. Miguel Cabrera twice hit more than 40 home runs after he was traded to the Detroit Tigers, but never once hit that many with the Marlins. Carlos Delgado eclipsed 40 homers three times with the Toronto Blue Jays, but failed to hit that many in his one season with the Marlins.\n\nStanton is the first Marlin other than Sheffield to get to 40. But out of all Marlins, Stanton is the one Sheffield assumed would have already wiped his name from the team's record books.\n\n\"Especially for a guy like him, who is known for home runs,\" Sheffield said. \"I wasn't really known for just hitting home runs.\"\n\nWhich is true.\n\nJeff Conine said Sheffield's 1996 season was the best he's ever witnessed by any teammate he's ever played with, and not because of the home runs.\n\n\"I hit behind him all year long and the violence of his swing and the ability to lay off pitches and take his walks was remarkable,\" Conine said. \"The ability to do damage when he got a pitch to hit was unreal.\"\n\nThat season, Sheffield hit .314, had a .465 on-base percentage, drove in 120 runs, and struck out just 66 times.\n\nIn terms of advanced metrics, Sheffield's 1996 season ranks as the greatest in franchise history. His 189 OPS+ (on-base plus slugging percentage adjusted by league and park effects) led the majors. By comparison, Stanton's OPS+ of 164 in 2014 ranks second to Sheffield among the most prolific seasons by a Marlin.\n\nConine said that by the end of the '96 season, opponents stopped pitching to Sheffield, which could help to explain the fact he failed to homer over the Marlins' final 14 games and hit just five in the final month of September.\n\n\"It was just one of those things where I was getting walked a lot,\" Sheffield said. \"That's the part of the game where guys don't want to face in the lineup. They would allow the next guy to try to hurt you. But my game plan was to try not be a selfish player and make they pitched to guys like Terry Pendleton and Jeff Conine. I believed in their abilities to get the job done.\n\nMonday -- Marlins LHP Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43) vs. San Francisco Giants LHP Ty Blach (8-7, 4.15), 7:10 p.m., Marlins Park.\n\nTuesday -- Marlins RHP Dan Straily (7-8, 3.74) vs. Giants LHP Madison Bumgarner (2-5, 2.71), 7:10 p.m., Marlins Park.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "17:10:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "02:18:00", "title": "Giancarlo Stanton keeps hitting home runs.

First-base umpire Pat Hoberg gave Arenado a quick thumb and Arenado raced down to first to plead his case.\n\nNo matter. The ejection stood and Arenado got tossed for just the third time in his career. He was replaced by Pat Valaika.\n\nThe overriding themes of the evening were the plight of the Rockies' struggling offense, the jaw-dropping power of Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton and the Rockies' mounting road woes. They fell to 30-30 away from home after losing for the 20th time in their last 26 road games.\n\nColorado went 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and is 3-for-27 with runners in scoring position four games into a five-game road trip. There was one ray of good news. Carlos Gonzalez collected his first RBI on the road since May 24 when he grounded out to second in the eighth, chasing home Mark Reynolds, to cut Miami's lead to 4-3.\n\nRockies infield prospect Ryan McMahon made his big-league debut in the eighth with two outs and runners at first and second, but he flew out to center fielder Christian Yelich.\n\nStanton blasted a three-run, speed-of-light homer off starter Jeff Hoffman in the fourth, giving the Marlins a 4-1 lead. It was Stanton's eighth homer in nine games and his 20th in his last 32 games. The ball came off his bat at 114 mph and Colorado left fielder Gerardo Parra barely moved as the ball sailed over his head.\n\nMeanwhile, the National League wild-card race continues to get muddier as September nears. Colorado entered the night as the NL's top wild-card team, with a one-game edge over Arizona. Streaking St. Louis won its eighth consecutive game and has entered the picture as a challenger for either the NL Central title or a wild-card berth.\n\nHoffman was gone after five so-so innings, having surrendering four runs on seven hits, with three walks.\n\nHoffman's command was clearly off kilter even in the third inning when the Marlins loaded the bases on singles by Stanton, Christian Yelich and a four-pitch walk to J.T. Realmuto, who took exception to a fastball near his head and stared Hoffman down. But Hoffman escaped by getting Derek Deitrich to fly out to center, keeping the game tied 1-1.\n\nColorado scored first, in the first. Charlie Blackmon led off with a single and stole second base, his 10th swipe this season. Blackmon took third on a fly out and scored on Mark Reynolds' single.\n\nMiami knotted the game in the bottom of the frame on a screeching double by Stanton, a walk by Yelich, a Hoffman wild pitch and an RBI groundout by Marcell Ozuna.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1015,

The Rockies have scored seven runs int heir last three games and three or less runs in five of their last 10 games. The Colorado Rockies have lost six of their last seven games when scoring three or less runs. Charlie Blackmon leads the Rockies with 155 hits and 74 RBI while Nolan Arenado and DJ LeMahieu have combined for 274 hits and 149 RBI. Jeff Hoffman gets the ball, and he is 6-3 with a 5.03 ERA and 71 strikeouts this season. This will be Hoffman's first career game against the Marlins.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Miami Marlins also need a win here after splitting their last 10 games. The Marlins have scored nine runs in their last three games and four or more runs in five of their last 10 games. The Miami Marlins have won five straight games when scoring more than three runs. Dee Gordon leads the Marlins with 134 hits and 24 RBI while Marcell Ozuna and Christian Yelich have combined for 250 hits and 145 RBI. Justin Nicolino gets the ball, and he is 0-1 with a 5.31 ERA and 14 strikeouts this season. This will be Nicolino's first career game against the Rockies.\n\nThe Rockies are 5-2 in their last 7 during game 2 of a series, 6-18 in their last 24 road games and 0-5 in Hoffmans last 5 starts during game 2 of a series. The Marlins are 5-2 in their last 7 home games, 2-5 in their last 7 games on grass and 3-7 in their last 10 vs. a team with a winning record. The Rockies are 3-9 in the last 12 meetings and the under is 9-3 in the last 12 meetings.\n\nHoffman has been solid his last two starts, but he's given up three or more earned runs in six of his last nine starts overall. Nicolino hasn't pitched since the end of June and hasn't exactly been great in his career as a Marlin. However, the fish are a different club at home, as they usually hit well and put a lot of pressure on other teams with their offense. In a game that could be a shootout, I'll give the edge to Miami because of the bats.\n\nOur Top Ranked Sportsbook BetDSI - get 100% Deposit Bonus NOW RANDY'S PICK Miami Marlins More Expert Picks Get Guaranteed Winners from loads of proven cappers at Sports Chat Place Experts Start Winning \" See Next MLB Pick >> Comments (0)\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nWebsite:\n\nNotify of New Replies:\n\nAllowed tags: <b><i><br>Add a new comment:\n\nPreview Post", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 71, "textStart": 56, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11"}, {"textEnd": 239, "textStart": 224, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12"}], "time": "22:00:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "02:19:00", "title": "Miami Marlins vs. Colorado Rockies -

They're always trying to do different things to make this team better. That's the way this league works.\"\n\nWith Stanton entering the final year of his contract, his final day in Arizona may be approaching, but any talk of a battle for the backup quarterback spot likely ended on Saturday at University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nPlaying all but the first series of the first half, Stanton completed 11 of 15 passes for 112 yards and a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Troy Niklas.\n\nHe led the Cardinals on two scoring drives -- a 28-yard field goal by Phil Dawson was the other -- and he played nearly mistake free, with the exception of an under-thrown ball to Chris Hubert in the end zone that was nearly picked off.\n\nHe finished with a passer rating of 116.5, which was higher than any game in his pro career in which he has thrown more than 10 passes.\n\n\"He was spot-on,\" Arians said. \"It's what I've seen in practice every day. He was dynamite in OTAs and has been throughout the training camp.\"\n\nStanton has had his detractors. He had a poor 2016 preseason and a poor 2016 regular season, completing just 19 of 49 passes for 192 yards, two TDs and three interceptions. When Blaine Gabbert completed 11 of 14 passes for 184 yards with a passer rating of 118.8 in a win over Dallas in the Hall of Fame Game, those same detractors (predictably) were calling for Gabbert to assume the No. 2 spot.\n\nSaturday's performance, coupled with Stanton's deep knowledge of the offense, likely erased any doubt in Arians' mind.\n\n\"You always need this kind of performance; it's always better than not playing well,\" Stanton said. \"I know those two throws that I tried to force the ball down the field -- sometimes you get greedy, especially in this offense because those plays present themselves -- you've got to be smart about that and find the check-down. I was able to do that, feel good about what I was trying to accomplish and we got points.\"\n\nOn the touchdown pass, a third-down play from the Oakland 7-yard line, Stanton was expecting a different kind of coverage, but when he didn't see Andre Ellington coming across the field, he was preparing to throw the ball away.\n\n\"Troy did a phenomenal job of coming back, aggressively downhill toward the ball and beat everybody else to the spot,\" Stanton said.\n\nWhile Arians thinks Gabbert's presence has pushed Stanton to new heights, Stanton said he feels competition every year. The main factors he cited in his improved play this year are a specifically-designed program by strength and conditioning coach Buddy Morris, and Carson Palmer's reduced throwing schedule.\n\n\"Getting a chance to work with the first team more has been really beneficial for me to just instill that confidence in myself,\" Stanton said. \"I have an understanding of the offense and a confidence level because I've been here -- this will be my sixth year in the offense -- but it's also something you don't take for granted and you like to get those reps just to keep the feel of it.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "04:59:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "11:16:00", "title": "Drew Stanton just ended Cardinals' so-called backup QB battle", "date": "2017-08-13", "uri": "708747872", "image": "http://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/stanton.jpg", "source": {"title": "Arizona Sports", "uri": "arizonasports.com", "id": "11621"}, "id": "8906637", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100, "id": 956}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "id": "198006", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "id": "231860", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302611", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304976", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305872", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310129", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp_(National_Football_League)", "label": {"eng": "Training camp (National Football League)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "311049", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312020", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325480", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Palmer", "label": {"eng": "Carson Palmer"}, "type": "person", "id": "341400", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Gabbert", "label": {"eng": "Blaine Gabbert"}, "type": "person", "id": "342530", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Phoenix_Stadium", "label": {"eng": "University of Phoenix Stadium"}, "type": "org", "id": "357141", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Arians", "label": {"eng": "Bruce Arians"}, "type": "person", "id": "357380", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI", "label": {"eng": "2016 NFL season"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "358976", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism", "label": {"eng": "Arianism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "361669", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Ellington", "label": {"eng": "Andre Ellington"}, "type": "person", "id": "391962", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Dawson", "label": {"eng": "Phil Dawson"}, "type": "person", "id": "412557", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Drew Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "421399", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1268994", "score": 3}]}

Nolan Arenado snared a hot shot that had extra bases and an RBI written all over it.

He protected a two-run lead in the fifth, when he came on with runners at second and third and none out, and escaped without allowing a run.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": null, "time": "20:38:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "20:38:00", "title": "Stanton hits homer No. 42 help Marlins sweep Rockies 5-3", "date": "2017-08-13", "uri": "708910821", "image": "https://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Rockies_Marlins_Baseball_14259.jpg", "source": {"title": "Federal News Radio", "uri": "federalnewsradio.com", "id": "9518"}, "id": "8964583", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100, "id": 385}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Greek", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Greek", "wgt": 100, "id": 1545}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "id": "182034", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304991", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305020", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305021", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305023", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305786", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305791", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310589", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}, "type": "org", "id": "310673", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing", "label": {"eng": "Web conferencing"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310943", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Administration", "label": {"eng": "Small Business Administration"}, "type": "org", "id": "330839", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "402053", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Sheffield", "label": {"eng": "Gary Sheffield"}, "type": "person", "id": "530805", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_Worley", "label": {"eng": "Vance Worley"}, "type": "person", "id": "553210", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_9-5", "label": {"eng": "Saab 9-5"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "616321", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javy_Guerra", "label": {"eng": "Javy Guerra"}, "type": "person", "id": "653294", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Trade_and_Development_Agency", "label": {"eng": "United States Trade and Development Agency"}, "type": "org", "id": "701623", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsored_Content_(South_Park)", "label": {"eng": "Sponsored Content (South Park)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1283290", "score": 2}]}

He pointed out Arians' comments from the night before. He showed Arians how much time was left on the clock. But it didn't matter. Palmer's first preseason action of the 2017 season had come and gone in the first 9 minutes of Arizona's 20-10 win over the Raiders at University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\n\"I thought I was going get the first quarter,\" Palmer said. \"That's what he said last night at the team meeting. I missed a couple. I missed a long one to (wide receiver) Jaron (Brown) and wanted to kind of redeem myself. I didn't get that chance.\n\n\"I've got to wait until next week.\"\n\nDrew Stanton doesn't need to redeem himself next week. He showed enough in Saturday's 20-10 win over the Oakland Raiders to temporarily quiet the chatter about him losing the back-up job to Blaine Gabbert.\n\nStanton threw for 112 yards and a touchdown on 11-for-15 passing in a quarter-and-a-half.\n\n\"He was spot on,\" Arians said. \"He tried to force one down there. We changed that route a little bit and he kind of got fooled by the receiver. I thought he was outstanding.\"\n\nWhile Stanton missed two deep shots, he played a controlled short game.\n\nThe culmination came about midway through the second quarter when Stanton scrambled to his right on a third-and-7 play after Raiders cornerback Sean Smith took away the out pass to Cardinals receiver Jeremy Ross. Stanton couldn't find his next two options, tight end Troy Niklas or running back Andre Ellington, so he rolled out wide. He finally spotted Niklas, the 6-foot-6 behemoth of a target, who was lurking in the back of the end zone. A moment before Stanton was going to throw the ball away, Niklas came charging toward the goal line \"aggressively downhill.\" He got to his spot first and Stanton hit him for the score.\n\n\"He flashed in front of my eyes,\" Stanton said.\n\nAfter last week's impressive debut by Gabbert, Saturday was the kind of game Stanton needed.\n\n\"You always need this kind of performance,\" he said. \"It's much better than not playing well. I'm sure there's stuff to go back and look at. I know those two throws that I tried to force the ball down the field, sometimes you get greedy, especially in this offense because those kinds of plays present themselves.\n\n\"You have to be smart and find the check-down. But I felt good about what I was trying to accomplish and we got points.\"\n\nThere are the evergreen reasons why Stanton flourished. He knows the offense better than anyone on the team. He's a veteran. He's a cerebral. But another reason why Stanton looked as good as he did Saturday night was because \"he's probably healthier than he was last year in training camp,\" Arians said.\n\nStanton said he took his preparation \"real serious\" during the offseason. He had a plan designed by strength and conditioning coach Buddy Morris and stuck with it.\n\nAnd it paid off.\n\n\"That's what I see in practice every day from OTAs (to now),\" Arians said. \"He was dynamite in OTAs and has been throughout training camp.\"", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "16:31:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "16:31:00", "title": "Drew Stanton picks up where Carson Palmer left off against Raiders", "date": "2017-08-13", "uri": "708840940", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0813%2Fr243594_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "source": {"title": "ESPN.com", "uri": "espn.com", "id": "4"}, "id": "8940165", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "wgt": 100, "id": 645}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 100, "id": 646}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "id": "231860", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302611", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304975", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305872", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310130", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312020", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Raiders", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Raiders"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314214", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316239", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324224", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Palmer", "label": {"eng": "Carson Palmer"}, "type": "person", "id": "341400", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Gabbert", "label": {"eng": "Blaine Gabbert"}, "type": "person", "id": "342530", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Phoenix_Stadium", "label": {"eng": "University of Phoenix Stadium"}, "type": "org", "id": "357141", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Arians", "label": {"eng": "Bruce Arians"}, "type": "person", "id": "357380", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism", "label": {"eng": "Arianism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "361669", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Ellington", "label": {"eng": "Andre Ellington"}, "type": "person", "id": "391962", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Drew Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "421399", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Ross", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Ross"}, "type": "person", "id": "503585", "score": 2}]}

First-base umpire Pat Hoberg gave Arenado a quick thumb and Arenado raced down to first to plead his case.\n\nNo matter. The ejection stood and Arenado got tossed for just the third time in his career. He was replaced by Pat Valaika.\n\n\"I was mostly mad at myself, but I can see why he threw me out,\" Arenado said. \"I said some words I probably shouldn't have said toward him, so I can see why I got thrown out.\n\n\"I was just more upset at my at-bats tonight, especially that last one. I got mad and he threw me out. I'm not surprised. I didn't mean it toward him, but then I saw the replay and I can definitely see why he threw me out.\"\n\nBench coach Mike Redmond, filling in for manager Bud Black, who was ill Saturday night, thought Hoberg made a mistake.\n\n\"He told me that he's been instructed to do that when a guys throws his bat and then looks at him,\" Redmon said. \"I explained to him, in the calmest voice that I have, that I thought he was wrong. ... But the damage had already been done.\"\n\nThe overriding themes of the evening were the plight of the Rockies' struggling offense, the jaw-dropping power of Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton and the Rockies' mounting road woes. They fell to 30-30 away from home after losing for the 20th time in their last 26 road games.\n\nColorado went 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and is 3-for-27 with runners in scoring position four games into a five-game road trip. There was one ray of good news. Carlos Gonzalez collected his first RBI on the road since May 24 when he grounded out to second in the eighth, chasing home Mark Reynolds, to cut Miami's lead to 4-3.\n\nRockies infield prospect Ryan McMahon made his big-league debut in the eighth with two outs and runners at first and second, but he flew out to center fielder Christian Yelich.\n\nAsked about his team's recent performance with runners in scoring position, Arenado said: \"Not good. We have to do better, all of us, including myself. I had a chance to drive in runs yesterday and again today. Everyone, from top to bottom, we need to be better.\"\n\nStanton blasted a three-run, speed-of-light homer off starter's Jeff Hoffman's hanging slider in the fourth, giving the Marlins a 4-1 lead. It was Stanton's eighth homer in nine games and his 20th in his last 32 games. The ball came off his bat at 114 mph and Colorado left fielder Gerardo Parra barely moved as the ball sailed over his head.\n\n\"With as hot as he is, you can't afford to make a mistake like that,\" Hoffman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National League wild-card race continues to get muddier as September nears. Colorado entered the night as the NL's top wild-card team, with a one-game edge over Arizona. Streaking St. Louis won its eighth consecutive game and has entered the picture as a challenger for either the NL Central title or a wild-card berth. The Cardinals are just 4 \u00bd games behind the Rockies.\n\nHoffman was gone after five so-so innings, having surrendering four runs on seven hits, with three walks and only one strikeout. Redmond praised Hoffman for the way he \"battled,\" but acknowledge that Hoffman didn't have his best stuff.\n\nRockies sign ex-MVP Howard\n\nThe Rockies signed veteran first baseman and former National League MVP Ryan Howard to a minor-league contract Saturday and will assign him to Triple-A Albuquerque.\n\nRyan, 37, was a huge star for the Philadelphia Phillies but is well past his prime and hasn't played in the majors this season. He provides some organizational depth and could be called up in September and used as a pinch hitter. He would be eligible for the playoffs if he is with the Rockies and they qualify for a postseason berth.\n\nHoward, who bats left-handed, signed a minor-league deal with Atlanta in April, but the Braves released him in May. He played in just 11 games for the Braves' Triple-A affiliate, hitting .184.\n\nBecause the Rockies signed Howard before the end of August, he would be eligible for the postseason roster, but he will have to show the Rockies that he can still hit for power to have any shot. He isn't on their 40-man roster, so the Rockies would have to clear a spot on the roster if they want to call him up in September.\n\nHoward was the National League rookie of the year in 2005, and he was the MVP in 2006, when he hit 58 home runs. He helped the Phillies win the 2008 World Series.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates":

Miami's rally included a bloop RBI single by Derek Dietrich and a two-run triple by Tomas Telis. McGee, not as sharp has he has been most of the season, also walked Marcell Ozuna, much to the consternation of manager Bud Black.\n\n\"I was just a little off tonight, and when I needed to make a few pitches, I left some over the middle of the plate,\" said McGee, now 0-2 with a 3.77 ERA. \"I had a few chances to get out of it. I thought I had Deitrich there, but he got a little bloop hit. And then Ozuna had a really good at-bat, and dragged it on a little bit. But at the end of the day I just have to (have) a little bit better location with my pitches.\"\n\nAlthough the loss landed on McGee's shoulders, starter Jon Gray shared the burden. The game presented the right-hander with an opportunity to take command and shut down the Marlins in ace-like fashion. He was unable to. Gray was spotted leads of 2-0 and 3-1, but he couldn't hold them.\n\nGray did pull off a nice high-wire act in the fifth, coming away with just a single run against him as Colorado held onto a 2-1 lead. Back-to-back singles by Dietrich and Telis set up a possible big inning. But Gray coaxed a groundball double play out of Miguel Rojas as Deitrich scored from third. The act was complete when Miami starter Jose Urena grounded out to Arenado.\n\nBut Gray couldn't repeat the feat in the sixth and Miami tied the game 3-3. Giancarlo Stanton unloaded with his 40th homer of the season, a 433-foot rocket to left. Since July 5, Stanton has hit 19 homers. San Francisco, as a team, has 20 home runs over that same span.\n\nGray seemed to lose focus after Stanton's bomb, walking two and giving up a double to Christian Yelich, who advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on J.T. Realmuto's sacrifice fly to deep center. Gray gave up three runs on eight hits with four strikeouts over 5 \u2154 innings.\n\nBoth Gray and Black disagreed with the idea that Gray's concentration wavered.\n\n\"That's a question for Jon, but I think I know the answer,\" Black said.\n\nSaid Gray: \"No I didn't (lose focus), I think I just expanded too much. I should have gone right after guys. Note to self: 'It can't happen again.' \"\n\nBlack, however, did have another explanation for Gray's inability to shut down the Marlins.\n\n\"I think that what got to Jon was too many balls up as the game went on,\" Black said. \"Stanton's homer -- up. And the other runs they got off him in the sixth, the ball was up.\"\n\nArenado became the first player in the majors to rack up 100 RBIs this season when he blasted a two-run homer to right-center in the third, scoring Charlie Blackmon, who led off with a double to right.\n\nThe statistics don't stop there, nor does the history. The Gold Glove third baseman is batting an MLB-best .446 (50-for-112) with runners in scoring position, 13 doubles, three triples and 10 homers. Plus, he became the first National League player to reach 100 RBIs for three consecutive seasons since Pittsburgh's Willie Stargell did it from 1971-73.\n\n\"He's having a great year, and for sure he's one of the best players in the game,\" Black said. \"And he's doing it every day. This guy has come into his own as a player, and has improved offensively to the point that he's at the point now that he's one of the most dangerous hitters in the game.\"\n\nGerardo Parra, who's hitting .400 since coming off the disabled list July 7, cranked his ninth homer of the season to lead off the sixth, pushing the Rockies ahead 3-1. In the third inning, Parra saved a possible run with a perfect throw from left field. Miami's Dee Gordon attempted to go from first to third on Stanton's single to left, but Parra threw a strike to Arenado, nailing Gordon, who inexplicably failed to slide.\n\nThe Rockies lost for just the fourth time this season when they hit two or more homers. They are now 35-4 in such games, still the best mark in the majors.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"},

On Sunday, he continued his remarkable home run outburst when he hit his 42nd of the season in the third inning against the Colorado Rockies at Marlins Park.\n\nThat tied Gary Sheffield (1996) for the Marlins' single-season record, which he labeled, \"Pretty cool.\"\n\n\"It's not something I will fully appreciate until the year is over, I'd say. But it's a cool thing to have under my belt. I've got time to get more.\"\n\nThe opposite-field homer off German Marquez tied the game and sparked a 5-3 comeback victory that completed a three-game sweep of Colorado, which began the day tied for the wild-card lead in the National League.\n\n\"I remember watching him a lot with the Dodgers,\" Stanton said of Sheffield, who played four seasons in Los Angeles while Stanton was growing up in nearby Sherman Oaks. \"I enjoyed watching him play as a kid. I didn't remember him too much with the Marlins. I know he had a championship. ... It's definitely good company.\"\n\nThe slugging right-fielder has not only authored a streak of power hitting rarely seen, he has embraced the moment with a joy not previously on display during his career.\n\n\"Most fun stretch, for sure,\" he said. \"We've got a ways to go for ... the regular season, but this stretch, for sure.\"\n\nThe Marlins' All-Star right fielder has been on an historic power surge, hitting 21 homers in his past 33 games. The latest was the 250th of his career.\n\nHe became the sixth-fastest since 1913 to reach that plateau, by games played, in his 941st. The others are Ryan Howard (855), Ralph Kiner (871), Harmon Killebrew (905), Albert Pujols (933) and Juan Gonzalez (936).\n\nIn terms of at-bats, Stanton (3,405) became the fifth fasted to reach 250 behind Harmon Killebrew (3,097), Kiner (3,133), Babe Ruth (3,145), and Howard (3,165).\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers, that's what I notice,\" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. \"He's smiling a lot when he's hitting homers.\n\n\"He does seem to be just kind of riding the wave. Obviously, he's up there with a lot of confidence and he's getting himself pitches to hit.\"\n\nNo. 42 was different than most Stanton homers. It traveled only 359 feet. After striking out in the first inning, he connected on Marquez's 97.6-mph fastball with the count full and lofted it into the lower stands in right field.\n\nStanton hit home runs in all three games this weekend. It was his ninth in 10 games and 16th in 28 games since the All-Star break. He led the major leagues by seven, with the New York Yankees' Aaron Judge entering Sunday with 35.\n\nThe other four runs came from unlikely sources, with starting pitcher Vance Worley and utility infielder Mike Aviles each driving in a pair.\n\nWorley was unable to stick around long enough to build on his back-to-back winning starts against the Washingotn Nationals.\n\nAviles' two-run double put the Marlins ahead 5-3, but Worley left without recording an out in the fifth after hitting Nolan Arenado on the left hand and serving a ground-rule double to Gerardo Parra. Arenado, the Rockies' All-Star third baseman and major league leader in RBI, left the game; X-rays were negative.\n\nJavy Guerra, in his second relief appearance for the Marlins, did an admirable job of getting out of the inning without giving up a run. He began by striking out Carlos Gonzalez on a full-count fastball, with J.T. Realmuto holding onto the foul tip, and got Ryan Hanigan on a grounder to second with the bases loaded to end the inning.\n\nGuerra breezed through a 1-2-3 sixth with two more strikeouts to earn his first win in the majors since Sept. 8, 2014 when he tossed two scoreless innings for the Chicago White Sox against Oakland.\n\nOdrisamer Despaigne recorded his first career save after Brian Ellington and Junichi Tazawa each contributed an inning to the five scoreless frames by an unusual combination of relievers.\n\nWorley had given himself an earlier lead with a two-out, two-run single in the second. The journeyman right-hander, who has shown some dexterity with the bat, reached out and poked a 2-2 fastball to right field that dropped in front of the diving Gonzalez.\n\nHe quickly gave the advantage back and more in a three-run Rockies third. But the Marlins kept an additional run off the board with a replay challenge that completed an inning-ending double play.\n\nFirst baseman Tomas Telis made an outstanding short-hop stab on Ryan McMahon's soft bouncer and a quick throw to second. The return throw to Worley at first beat the runner, but umpire Tony Randazzo ruled the pitcher's foot was off the base.\n\nA review that took 1:28 showed Worley made contact with the inner edge of the bag just ahead of McMahon.\n\nStanton had two more chances to pass Sheffield. He grounded out in the fourth, then was peeved when called out on strikes in the seventh. He had some parting words for plate ump Pat Hoberg. But Antonio Senzatela delivered the perfect pitcher's pitch with a full-count fastball that FoxTrax showed kissing the lower outside corner.\n\nStanton hasn't returned to the dugout with a frown often lately. But it hasn't been as easy as he's made it appear.\n\nHe continues to make adjustments at the plate, including a much more closed stance in recent weeks.\n\n\"It's kept me inside on everything,\" he said. \"Not pulling off. I've been more on-time and ready to go on off-speed, heaters and everything.\n\n\"I've watched film over and over again until my eyes hurt, to figure it out.\"\n\nNow teammates' eyes light up every time Stanton come up.\n\nGuerra said, \"It's very weird to see a guy come to the plate and you think he could [hit a homer] every time. So you know you're watching something special.\"\n\ncldavis@sun-sentinel.com; Twitter @CraigDavisRuns; here on Facebook", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3764, "textStart": 3751,

He connected on Marquez's 97.6-mph fastball with the count full and lofted it into the lower stands in right field.\n\nStanton has hit home runs in all three games this weekend. It was his ninth in 10 games and 16th in 28 games since the All-Star break. He leads the major leagues by seven, with the Yankees' Aaron Judge entering Sunday with 35.\n\nVance Worley was unable to stick around long enough to build on his back-to-back winning starts against the Nationals.\n\nMike Aviles' two-run double put the Marlins ahead 5-3, but Worley left without recording an out in the fifth after hitting Nolan Arenado on the left hand and serving a ground-rule double to Gerardo Parra. Arenado, the Rockies' All-Star third baseman and major league leader in RBI, left the game.\n\nJavy Guerra, in his second relief appearance for the Marlins, did an admirable job of getting out of the inning without giving up a run. He began by striking out Carlos Gonzalez on a full-count fastball, with J.T. Realmuto holding onto the foul tip, and got Ryan Hanigan on a grounder to second with the bases loaded to end the inning.\n\nGuerra breezed through a 1-2-3 sixth with two more strikeouts to earn his first win in the majors since Sept. 8, 2014 when he tossed two scoreless innings for the White Sox against Oakland.\n\nWorley had given himself an earlier lead with a two-out, two-run single in the second. The journeyman right-hander, who has shown some dexterity with the bat, reached out and poked a 2-2 fastball to right field that dropped in front of the diving Gonzalez.\n\nHe quickly gave the advantage back and more in a three-run Rockies third. But the Marlins kept an additional run off the board with a replay challenge that completed an inning-ending double play.\n\nFirst baseman Tomas Telis made an outstanding short-hop stab on Ryan McMahon's soft bouncer and a quick throw to second. The return throw to Worley at first beat the runner, but umpire Tony Randazzo ruled the pitcher's foot was off the base.\n\nA review that took 1:28 showed Worley made contact with the inner edge of the bag just ahead of McMahon.\n\nStanton had two more chances to pass Sheffield. He grounded out in the fourth, then was peeved when he called out on strikes in the seventh. He had some parting words for plate ump Pat Hoberg. But Antonio Senzatela delivered the perfect pitcher's pitch with a full-count fastball that FoxTrax showed kissing the lower outside corner.\n\ncldavis@sun-sentinel.com; Twitter @CraigDavisRuns; here

With yet another home run on Sunday (he's homered in four straight games and nine times this month), Stanton now has 42 on the 2017 season -- and 21 in his last 33 games. Just when it looked like Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees was going to usurp Stanton's crown as the game's top power hitter, Stanton has reclaimed it with a vengeance.\n\nStanton's season is already historic; only 11 times in the 162-game-schedule era has a batter hit 42 or more home runs in his team's first 116 ballgames. But Stanton can set his sights on another historic mark: the pre-steroids single-season home run record of 61, set by Roger Maris in 1961.\n\nMark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds later surpassed Maris's mark. But McGwire and Sosa either admitted to or tested positive for using performance-enhancing drugs, and Bonds was mentioned prominently in the Mitchell Report (which investigated the use of steroids in baseball), thus tainting their accomplishments in the eyes of many fans. So for Stanton, breaking Maris's \"record\" would bring cachet even if it isn't technically the record anymore.\n\nAnd by the numbers alone, Stanton -- who needs 20 more home runs by the end of the season to best Maris -- has an outside shot at the feat. For every batter who hit at least 35 homers in the first 116 games of a 162-game season, I recorded how many homers each managed over the rest of the season. About 11 percent managed to hit at least 20 more home runs.\n\nSo there's a chance. But if you look at who did the homering over the rest of the season, Stanton's odds might need to be adjusted downward more than a little. Of the eight hitter-seasons in our sample with 20 or more home runs between Game 116 and season's end, all came in the steroid era, and only one -- the great Ken Griffey Jr. -- belonged to a player never associated with performance-enhancing drug use. The most by a recent player was the 18 late-season homers that Jose Bautista hit in 2010.\n\nThat means Stanton will need the kind of performance not seen since the steroid era to beat Maris's old record -- a tall order, even for one of history's greatest power hitters. Of course, maybe juiced balls are the equivalent of steroids for today's batters, which would certainly boost Stanton's odds. Either way, to get there, he'll have to stay nearly as hot as he's been in this recent streak over the entire rest of the year.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "20:47:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "20:47:00", "title": "Giancarlo Stanton Will Need To Slug Like Barry Bonds To Beat Roger Maris", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "709436402", "image": "https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/stanton1.jpg?w=640", "source": {"title": "FiveThirtyEight", "uri": "fivethirtyeight.com", "id": "1986"}, "id": "9159073", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100, "id": 96}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100, "id": 134}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 100, "id": 135}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 137}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 100, "id": 523}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "wgt": 100, "id": 751}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302773", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305016", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305021", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305786", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305791", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(P)", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (P)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310554", "score": 1}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}, "type": "org", "id": "310673", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Bautista", "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Bautista"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310891", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "type": "org", "id": "312732", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321495", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334415", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334720", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drugs", "label": {"eng": "Performance-enhancing drugs"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "336115", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Sosa", "label": {"eng": "Sammy Sosa"}, "type": "person", "id": "375952", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McGwire", "label": {"eng": "Mark McGwire"}, "type": "person", "id": "375955", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}, "type": "person", "id": "402053", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds", "label": {"eng": "Barry Bonds"}, "type": "person", "id": "419675", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Report", "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Report"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "422421", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Maris", "label": {"eng": "Roger Maris"}, "type": "person", "id": "475225", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_baseball_in_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "History of baseball in the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "573341", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Griffey_Jr.", "label": {"eng": "Ken Griffey Jr."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1275821", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_baseball", "label": {"eng": "Doping in baseball"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1288122", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_progressive_single-season_home_run_leaders", "label": {"eng": "List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1374547", "score": 3}]}

First-base umpire Pat Hoberg gave Arenado a quick thumb and Arenado raced down to first to plead his case.\n\nNo matter. The ejection stood and Arenado got tossed for just the third time in his career. He was replaced by Pat Valaika.\n\n\"I was mostly mad at myself, but I can see why he threw me out,\" Arenado said. \"I said some words I probably shouldn't have said toward him, so I can see why I got thrown out.\n\n\"I was just more upset at my at-bats tonight, especially that last one. I got mad and he threw me out. I'm not surprised. I didn't mean it toward him, but then I saw the replay and I can definitely see why he threw me out.\"\n\nBench coach Mike Redmond, filling in for manager Bud Black, who was ill Saturday night, thought Hoberg made a mistake.\n\n\"He told me that he's been instructed to do that when a guys throws his bat and then looks at him,\" Redmon said. \"I explained to him, in the calmest voice that I have, that I thought he was wrong. ... But the damage had already been done.\"\n\nThe overriding themes of the evening were the plight of the Rockies' struggling offense, the jaw-dropping power of Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton and the Rockies' mounting road woes. They fell to 30-30 away from home after losing for the 20th time in their last 26 road games.\n\nColorado went 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and is 3-for-27 with runners in scoring position four games into a five-game road trip. There was one ray of good news. Carlos Gonzalez collected his first RBI on the road since May 24 when he grounded out to second in the eighth, chasing home Mark Reynolds, to cut Miami's lead to 4-3.\n\nRockies infield prospect Ryan McMahon made his big-league debut in the eighth with two outs and runners at first and second, but he flew out to center fielder Christian Yelich.\n\nAsked about his team's recent performance with runners in scoring position, Arenado said: \"Not good. We have to do better, all of us, including myself. I had a chance to drive in runs yesterday and again today. Everyone, from top to bottom, we need to be better.\"\n\nStanton blasted a three-run, speed-of-light homer off starter's Jeff Hoffman's hanging slider in the fourth, giving the Marlins a 4-1 lead. It was Stanton's eighth homer in nine games and his 20th in his last 32 games. The ball came off his bat at 114 mph and Colorado left fielder Gerardo Parra barely moved as the ball sailed over his head.\n\n\"With as hot as he is, you can't afford to make a mistake like that,\" Hoffman said.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1778, "textStart": 1772,

The major league record for consecutive games with a long ball is eight, set by Don Mattingly in 1987 and tied by Ken Griffey Jr. in 1993.\n\nStanton's torrid stretch earned him National League Player of the Week honors Monday, capping a week in which he homered six times in seven games.\n\n\"Just been really fun to watch, as much as anything,\" manager Don Mattingly said Monday afternoon. \"It's good to see him basically being able to do the things he's doing. And it looks like he's having some fun. When he's doing that, it puts us in a lot better position.\"\n\nAnd Stanton's teammates have just gone along for a ride. Over the weekend, that meant a sweep of the Colorado Rockies. On Monday, it meant a 2-0 lead in the first inning -- before the Marlins had even made an out.

Friday the four-time All-Star joined Sheffield as the only to hit 40 in a season when he drove a slider from Colorado Rockies right-hander Jon Gray 433 feet to left field at Marlins Park.\n\nStanton's homer sparked a two-run rally to tie the game in the sixth. Derek Dietrich's bloop single in the eighth sent a hustling Christian Yelich home with the go-ahead run and Tomas Telis added a two-run triple to propel the Marlins to a 6-3 victory.\n\n\"It's definitely pretty cool. I've got a ways to go, though,\" Stanton said. \"But I'm glad I could get to that finally and help us win. Worked out.\"\n\nStanton's homer was his seventh in his past eight games and 14th in 26 games since the All-Star break. As dialed in as the All-Star right fielder has been, it seems inevitable, if not imminent, that he will obliterate Sheffield's single-season mark.\n\n\"Yeah, in due time,\" Stanton said, adding that 50 homers is within his reach. \"I have time. Just got to play right. Play good.\"\n\nAlthough Stanton's blast energized the Marlins, they had a couple not-so-uplifting moments early in the game. If the reported agreement for the sale of the team to a group led by Derek Jeter goes through, the new owner should make video of the way he played required viewing for his players.\n\nIt was never with the laissez faire approach that cost the Marlins some prime scoring chances early in the game.\n\nIt was more like Yelich correctly reading that the ball Dietrich hit to center would drop in and wasting no time racing home from second in the eighth.\n\nEarlier, the Jeter-like example was demonstrated by Rockies left fielder Gerardo Parra in throwing out two dawdling Marlins runners and smashing a home run, one of two allowed by Marlins starter Jose Urena.\n\nThe embarrassing misadventures on the base paths began in the third inning when Dee Gordon ran the Marlins out of their first threat against Gray. Gordon took a lackadaisical, circle route on the way from first to third on Stanton's laser-like single to left and was thrown out by Parra to end the inning.\n\nThe next inning, Marcell Ozuna hit a popup near the left-field line that fell for a hit among converging Rockies. Ozuna apparently thought one of them would catch it because he jogged out of the box.\n\nBy the time he turned on the jets it was too late. Parra threw him out at second.\n\n\"Bad decision by me, not running hard,\" Ozuna said. \"I apologized. I told Donnie, I'm going to be better than that.\"\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" Mattingly said. \"If you're going to end up being a championship-type club or a club that's going to contend to be in the playoffs, those are not mistakes that you can really afford to make. Those really almost never should happen.\n\n\"Getting thrown out or whatever, making a decision that's maybe a little too aggressive, that's a little different than a mistake where you're really not doing the right thing.\"\n\nParra then precipitated Urena's exit when he drove a 2-2 slider 380 feet into the seats in right leading off the sixth.\n\nUrena, the odd-man out of the Marlins' starting staff when the season began, has climbed to de facto ace amid the turmoil of injuries and failures that have wracked the rotation\n\nWhile Dan Straily has faltered since the All-Star break (0-4, 5.17 ERA), Urena has been steadily on the rise. But it's a slippery slope, as has been demonstrated often this season as the Marlins have already gone through 11 different starters.\n\nFacing one of the best hitting teams in the National League, Urena was erratic but reasonably effective, except for homers by Parra and Nolan Arenado.\n\nThe All-Star third baseman reached out and clubbed a changeup on the outer half of the plate the opposite way for his 26th homer, a two-run shot in the third. It came with All-Star center fielder Charlie Blackmon aboard after leading off the inning with a double, and made Arenado the first to 100 RBI in the majors this season.\n\nUrena left trailing 3-1 with one in the fifth after hitting Jonathan Lucroy and leaveing two runners aboard. He threw 98 pitches to get that far in a laborious outing.\n\nReliever Dustin McGowan stranded the runners with a pair of strikeouts to keep the deficit at two runs and make the eventual turnaround possible.\n\nStanton got it started with the high-impact swing he has been generating with remarkable regularity.\n\n\"Just a different approach overall at the plate,\" Stanton said. \"A different mindset. One set overall that works. Just stay inside the ball, pretty much.\"\n\nStanton's example proved contagious in the late innings, with left-handed hitting Dietrich getting the go-ahead hit off lefty reliever Jake McGee. Then Telis, a switch-hitter who is best from the left-side, turning around and drilling his second career triple in the gap in left-center.\n\n\"I'm excited. He's the big guy on the team,\" Ozuna said of Stanton. \"He's having good success. Good approach at the plate. If it hits the barrel, it's gone.\"\n\ncldavis@sun-sentinel.com; Twitter @CraigDavisRuns; here on Facebook", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "22:00:00", "originalArticle": null,

Thankfully, the loss in the W-L column was the biggest one they suffered on the day. For a time, it looked like that might not be the case.\n\nLeading off the top of the fifth inning, All-Star third baseman and MLB RBI leader Nolan Arenado was hit in the left hand with a pitch by Vance Worley. Arenado immediately exited the game. After the game, the team announced that x-rays were negative and the official reason for Arenado's departure was a left hand contusion.\n\nGerman Marquez (9-5, 4.13 ERA) suffered his shortest outing since June 26, going just 4.1 innings and allowing five runs on seven hits and a walk. It was the first time in six starts that Marquez did not pitch at least 6.0 innings.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton hit his third home run in as many games against Colorado, a shot down the right field line to lead off the third inning and tie the game. It was Stanton's 250th career home run.\n\nPat Valaika was 3-for-4 on the day, but had no runs scored or RBIs to show for it. The Rockies had two on and with no outs in both the fifth and eighth innings but could not push anyone across.\n\nMissed opportunities were the story of the weekend for Colorado, who was 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position on Friday, 2-for 11 on Saturday and 2-for-12 on Sunday.\n\nAfter being called on Friday, Ryan McMahon registered his first big-league hit - a single in the eighth inning - in his first start.\n\nAfter a strong showing on Saturday, Colorado's bullpen again was solid on Sunday with 3.2 innings of one-hit relief from Adam Ottavino (0.2 IP), Antonio Senzatela (2.0 IP) and Carlos Estevez (1.0). Miami's pen was just as strong, though, combining for 5.0 innings and allowing just two hits.\n\nWith the loss, Colorado (60-52) falls below .500 for the first time this season (30-31).", "location":

Rizzo said Sunday that Harper had an MRI afterward that showed no structural damage.\n\nThere's no timeline for Harper to return, but manager Dusty Baker referenced 10 days to two weeks. At the very least the Nationals are hopeful the star outfielder will be back before the end of the season.\n\n\"It was definitely a relief,\" Harper said Sunday. \"We're going to take some time to definitely let it heal.

It got real tight. That was my concern -- how tight it was getting. Luckily it's not broken, but it hurts a little bit.\"\n\nArenado was hit by a pitch from Vance Worley. Following the Rockies' 5-3 loss, Arenado said his hand was swollen and stiff, but he hopes to be sidelined for only a couple of days and avoid a stint on the disabled list.\n\nThe All-Star third baseman has missed only three games this season and is batting .311.\n\nStanton keeps hitting records *\n\nAll-Star Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton reached a couple of milestones Sunday by hitting a homer in his fourth consecutive game, and the Marlins completed their first series sweep of the Colorado Rockies since 2006, winning 5-3.\n\nStanton hit his 42nd homer leading off the third inning to tie Gary Sheffield's team record set in 1996. It was the 250th homer of Stanton's career and came in his 941st game.\n\nOnly five players since 1913 have reached the 250-milestone faster, and Stanton's pace is accelerating. The homer was his 21st in the past 33 games.\n\n\"There's a lot happening at once,\" Stanton said. \"Just enjoy the ride, and keep it going.\"\n\nRockies say Bettis is back * Rockies righthander Chad Bettis will complete his comeback from chemotherapy for testicular cancer when he starts Monday night at Coors Field against Atlanta.\n\nThe 28-year-old Bettis finished his last round of treatment in May, two months after doctors discovered his cancer had spread. He had surgery in November to remove the cancer, but it returned and he was forced to leave the team in March for chemotherapy.\n\nThe Rockies announced before their game Sunday at Miami that Bettis will rejoin the rotation.\n\nThe game will be Bettis' first in the majors since Sept. 30.

On Saturday, Miami again put up three runs in one frame that ultimately decided the game. With the 4-3 victory, Miami grabbed the series win from the visiting Rockies.\n\nColorado and Miami traded runs in the first inning off starters Justin Nicolino (1-1, 4.56 ERA) and Jeff Hoffman (6-4, 5.15). Mark Reynolds singled in Charlie Blackmon after a leadoff single to give Colorado the early advantage. Giancarlo Staton would come around to score on a Marcell Ozuna ground out after doubling to deep right center.\n\nStaton would again get the best of Hoffman in the bottom of the fourth when he hit his MLB-best 41st home run of the season - a three run shot to put Miami up 3-1.\n\nColorado answered with a run in the top of the fifth. Blackmon again led off with a single, the stole second and moved up to third on a throwing error. DJ LeMahieu drove him in with a sac fly.\n\nColorado's bullpen held ground for the three innings they pitched. Chris Rusin allowed two hits over two scoreless innings, and Carlos Estevez gave up one hit in the eighth.\n\nNolan Arenado was ejected from the game for arguing with an umpire after striking out in the top of the seventh inning. The MLB RBI leader disagreed with a check swing call that ended the inning.\n\nThe Rockies scored another run in the eighth, but could not capitalize on getting a pair of runners on with only one out. Ryan McMahon flied out to center with two on and two out in his first Major League at-bat.\n\nColorado will try and salvage the final game of the series before returning home to Coors Field. German Marquez (9-4, 3.88) will try and right the ship for the Rockies, who have lost four of their last five games.

Miami's rally included a bloop RBI single by Derek Dietrich and a two-run triple by Tomas Telis. McGee, not as sharp has he has been most of the season, also walked Marcell Ozuna, much to the consternation of manager Bud Black.\n\n\"I was just a little off tonight, and when I needed to make a few pitches, I left some over the middle of the plate,\" said McGee, now 0-2 with a 3.77 ERA. \"I had a few chances to get out of it. I thought I had Deitrich there, but he got a little bloop hit. And then Ozuna had a really good at-bat, and dragged it on a little bit. But at the end of the day I just have to (have) a little bit better location with my pitches.\"\n\nAlthough the loss landed on McGee's shoulders, starter Jon Gray shared the burden. The game presented the right-hander with an opportunity to take command and shut down the Marlins in ace-like fashion. He was unable to. Gray was spotted leads of 2-0 and 3-1, but he couldn't hold them.\n\nGray did pull off a nice high-wire act in the fifth, coming away with just a single run against him as Colorado held onto a 2-1 lead. Back-to-back singles by Dietrich and Telis set up a possible big inning. But Gray coaxed a groundball double play out of Miguel Rojas as Deitrich scored from third. The act was complete when Miami starter Jose Urena grounded out to Arenado.\n\nBut Gray couldn't repeat the feat in the sixth and Miami tied the game 3-3. Giancarlo Stanton unloaded with his 40th homer of the season, a 433-foot rocket to left. Since July 5, Stanton has hit 19 homers. San Francisco, as a team, has 20 home runs over that same span.\n\nGray seemed to lose focus after Stanton's bomb, walking two and giving up a double to Christian Yelich, who advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on J.T. Realmuto's sacrifice fly to deep center. Gray gave up three runs on eight hits with four strikeouts over 5 \u2154 innings.\n\nBoth Gray and Black disagreed with the idea that Gray's concentration wavered.\n\n\"That's a question for Jon, but I think I know the answer,\" Black said.\n\nSaid Gray: \"No I didn't (lose focus), I think I just expanded too much. I should have gone right after guys. Note to self: 'It can't happen again.' \"\n\nBlack, however, did have another explanation for Gray's inability to shut down the Marlins.\n\n\"I think that what got to Jon was too many balls up as the game went on,\" Black said. \"Stanton's homer -- up. And the other runs they got off him in the sixth, the ball was up.\"", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"},

WATCH IT LIVE ON FOX SPORTS GO\n\nMIAMI -- The Miami Marlins, who have won five of their past seven series, hope to continue their positive momentum on Monday when they open a three-game series against the San Francisco Giants.\n\nRight fielder Giancarlo Stanton, who leads the majors with 42 homers, is leading the Marlins' charge. He is one homer away from breaking Gary Sheffield's franchise single-season record set in 1996.\n\nWatch the Miami Marlins on FOX Sports Florida Broadcast scheduleFOX Sports GoVIDEO: Marlins news, interviews & exclusive featuresMarlins Clubhouse\n\nIn addition, Stanton has hit nine homers in his past 10 games and 21 long balls in his past 33 contests. He belted a solo shot Sunday in the Marlins' 5-3 win over the Colorado Rockies that completed a three-game sweep.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said with a smirk. \"He smiles a lot when he hits homers. He seems to be riding the wave. He's having fun.\"\n\nThe Marlins have had some fun at the Giants' expense lately. Since 2015, the Marlins are 10-6 against the Giants, including 3-0 this year, sweeping a series at San Francisco from July 7-9.\n\nNeither team is a legitimate playoff contender this year. The Marlins are 56-60 and 8 1/2 games out of contention for a wild-card spot. They would have to pass four teams that they are now trailing to get in the playoffs -- an unlikely scenario.\n\nThe Giants (47-72) are completely out of it with the third-worst record in the majors. And San Francisco's best player, All-Star catcher Buster Posey, has not had much success in 41 career games against the Marlins, batting .262 with just two homers.\n\nOn Monday, the Marlins will start second-year left-hander Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43 ERA), and the Giants will throw rookie lefty Ty Blach (8-7, 4.15).\n\nConley has lost his past two starts. He allowed a season-high 11 hits and five runs in five innings Wednesday at Washington.\n\nBlach is 2-0 in August and has pitched at least seven innings in five consecutive starts. He pitches to contact, averaging just 4.4 strikeouts per nine innings and 9.7 hits. However, he doesn't walk many (1.9 per nine) and gives up few homers -- just two in his past seven starts.\n\nThere is not much past history to go on for Conley against the Giants -- just one meeting. He got a no-decision after allowing four runs in 5 2/3 innings at San Francisco on April 24, 2016.\n\nBlach, who has never faced Miami, will very quickly have to figure out how to slow Stanton, who comes up second in the batting order.\n\nFor his career, Stanton has 101 homers at Marlins Park and 250 overall. He moved ahead of Mickey Mantle into 16th place in major league history for the most long balls in a player's first eight years. Since 1913, Stanton is the sixth-fastest player to reach 250 homers.\n\nStanton also leads the majors with 19 go-ahead homers this year, a Marlins single-season record.\n\n\"He's getting up there with a lot of confidence, and he's swinging the bat well,\" Mattingly said. \"He's getting pitches to hit.\n\n\"You want to stretch out this (hot streak) as long as it will go because there are days coming where you get shut down.\"\n\nThe Giants hope that starts Monday with Blach and with pitchers such as former Marlins reliever Sam Dyson and closer Mark Melancon, who came off the disabled list on Saturday.\n\nMelancon, who hadn't pitched since June 27 due to an elbow injury, threw a scoreless inning Saturday night against Washington.\n\n\"This hasn't been easy,\" Melancon said. \"It was a tough couple of weeks on the DL, but I'm excited to get out there again.\"\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy said he would try to ease Melancon back into high-leverage situations. In the meantime, Dyson will serve as the closer.\n\nDyson has nine saves in his past 10 chances. He also has a 2.13 ERA in 24 appearances for San Francisco.\n\nThe Giants, who played three games in 24 hours, including a doubleheader that they split with the Nationals on Sunday, surely will be a tired team when they arrive in Miami without the benefit of a day off on the current road trip.\n\nSan Francisco has also yet to name a starter for the Wednesday series finale against the Marlins.\n\nMatt Cain, who hasn't started a game since July 31, is the likely choice. Albert Suarez, who started 12 games for the Giants last year, is another option. Suarez has made six big-league appearances this season, all in relief, including Sunday night, when he allowed a walk-off grand slam to Washington's Howie Kendrick in the 11th inning.\n\nMeanwhile, Mattingly said Marlins reliever Kyle Barraclough (shoulder impingement) is nearing a return from the disabled list. That could happen during the Giants series, according to the Miami manager.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1231, "imp": true, "textEnd": 1239, "date": "2017-07-07", "dateEnd":

With Jeff Hoffman set to face Justin Nicolino in the pitching matchup, the over/under currently sits at 9 runs.\n\nMLB Quick Links: Scores & Matchups | Injuries | Odds Comparison | Betting Trends | ATS Stats\n\nFrom Rotoworld: Hoffman was fantastic while taking a no-decision in Sunday's loss to the Phillies, surrendering one run on four hits over seven innings. Lovely work by Hoffman, here, as he struck out eight and walked just one. The only run to score on his watch came when Maikel Franco took him deep for a solo home run in the second inning. Otherwise, nothing doing for the Phillies over his seven innings of work. Hoffman struggled to an 8.00 ERA in five July outings, but has pitched well in his two starts this month, allowing three runs on nine hits over 13 innings. He will try for more of the same in a road date with the Marlins in his next scheduled outing.\n\nMarlins recalled Nicolino from Triple-A New Orleans. It's getting to be do-or-die time for Nicolino, who is 8-11 with a 4.61 ERA in 30 starts and six relief appearances for the Marlins over the last three seasons. He'll make his return to the rotation Saturday against the Rockies.\n\nBet Tonight's Rockies vs. Marlins Game\n\nOUR PREDICTION: The Rockies have dropped eight of 10 in Miami, 10 of 13 against the Marlins overall, and are 2-12 in their last 14 road games when facing a team with a losing record. Colorado has also dropped 19 of 26 games on the road overall. On the other side, the Marlins have been a good bet at home, winning six of their last eight games in Miami. They're also 7-3 in their last 10 games versus National League West opponents.\n\nSATURDAY MLB PREDICTION: MIAMI MARLINS +110\n\nRecent MLB Discussions Mlb for sun on Sun, Aug 2017 by Michael CashMLB Betting News and Notes Sunday, August 13th, 2017 on Sun, Aug 2017 by BladeMLB Trends Sunday, August 13th, 2017 on Sun, Aug 2017 by BladeMlb for Sat.

I'm not sure we know exactly what that will be.\"\n\nNicolino, who needs to be crafty in lieu of overpowering velocity, has struggled for the answer through three seasons of bouncing between Miami and the minors.\n\nSaturday was his best effort in a while. His main deficiency was being unable to get Charlie Blackmon out, a task others have struggled with this season.\n\nThe National League's second-leading hitter singled all three first three times up off Nicolino and scored twice. Both runs were set up by stolen bases. An error by J.T. Realmuto on the throw in the fifth sent Blackmon to third, and he scored an unearned run on a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Marlins unexpectedly found themselves up against their former manager, Mike Redmond, the Rockies bench coach who filled in with Bud Black feeling ill. Redmond was in the opposite dugout when Nicolino won his major league debut in 2015 with seven shutout innings at Cincinnati.\n\nNicolino got through a shaky first inning on two hits, including Jonathon Lucroy's two-out RBI single, and all three outs on balls solidly hit to the outfield.\n\nThe Marlins got the run back on their half of the inning, sparked by another resounding hit by Stanton that went for a double. He scored on Marcell Ozuna's goundout.\n\nNicolino received backing of double plays started by shortstop Miguel Rojas in the second and third innings, the latter an artful stab behind second base and flip to Dee Gordon, who took it barehanded and completed the quick turn.\n\nA two-out walk and ground-rule double by Carlos Gonzalez turned a routine inning into a bind. Opposing pitcher Hoffman's turn in the order provided the escape hatch.\n\nStanton's latest moon shot made it 4-1 in the fourth and continued his ridiculous pace with 20 homers in his past 32 games. On Friday he reached 40 homers in the Marlins' 114th game, the third-fastest to do so in the 16 seasons since 2001 when Barry Bonds set the single-season homer record.\n\nIt was the 19th time he has given the Marlins a lead with a homer, a club record.\n\nThe Marlins got a mostly solid effort from the bullpen, capped by Brad Ziegler recording his second save of the series and fourth in four attempts since taking over as closer since A.J. Ramos was traded.\n\nWorkhorse Dustin McGowan stranded two runners left by Nicolino in the sixth. Drew Stecknrider struck out two in the seventh, including Nolan Arenado, who was ejected after slamming his bat down and dashing to first in dispute of umpire Pat Hoberg ruling that he went around on an attempt to check his swing.\n\nThe Rockies benefited in the bottom of the inning when Hoberg called Ozuna out when he was tagged after making a slight move toward second after being safe on a wild throw.\n\nRighty Brian Ellington gave up a run in an erratic eighth that included a walk, wild pitch, hit batter and a passed ball.\n\ncldavis@sun-sentinel.com; Twitter @CraigDavisRuns; here on

With German Marquez set to face Vance Worley in the pitching matchup, the over/under currently sits at 8.5 runs.\n\nMLB Quick Links: Scores & Matchups | Injuries | Odds Comparison | Betting Trends | ATS Stats\n\nFrom Rotoworld: Marquez hurled six scoreless innings against the Indians but had to settle for a no-decision as the bullpen blew the game in the ninth inning on Tuesday. It was a real pitcher's duel between Marquez and Corey Kluber. Marquez allowed just two base hits and three walks while striking out three batters in the gem outing. He was in line for a win until Rockies' closer Greg Holland melted down in the ninth. His record holds at 9-4 with a 3.88 ERA and 1.28 WHIP on the season.\n\nWorley delivered another strong start in Tuesday's victory over the Nationals, allowing one run on six hits over his six innings. The veteran right-hander walked three and struck out two in the ballgame. The only blemish on his night came on an RBI ground out by Bryce Harper in the third inning. He'll look to further improve upon his 4.82 ERA and 1.41 WHIP when he does battle against the Rockies on Sunday.\n\nBet Today's Rockies vs. Marlins Game\n\nOUR PREDICTION: The Rockies have dropped four of their last five games against the Marlins, are 1-5 in their last six games in Miami, and are just 6-20 in their last 26 road games. On the other side, the Marlins are a perfect 4-0 in their last four home games, are 5-0 in Worley's last five starts and have won 20 of 27 at home versus a right-handed starter.\n\nSUNDAY MLB PREDICTION: MIAMI MARLINS -105\n\nRecent MLB Discussions Mlb for sun on Sun, Aug 2017 by Michael CashMLB Betting News and Notes Sunday, August 13th, 2017 on Sun, Aug 2017 by BladeMLB Trends Sunday, August 13th, 2017 on Sun, Aug 2017 by BladeMlb for Sat.

He is one homer away from breaking Gary Sheffield's franchise single-season record set in 1996.\n\nIn addition, Stanton has hit nine homers in his past 10 games and 21 long balls in his past 33 contests. He belted a solo shot Sunday in the Marlins' 5-3 win over the Colorado Rockies that completed a three-game sweep.\n\n\"I think he likes hitting homers,\" Marlins manager Don Mattingly said with a smirk. \"He smiles a lot when he hits homers. He seems to be riding the wave. He's having fun.\"\n\nThe Marlins have had some fun at the Giants' expense lately. Since 2015, the Marlins are 10-6 against the Giants, including 3-0 this year, sweeping a series at San Francisco from July 7-9.\n\nNeither team is a legitimate playoff contender this year. The Marlins are 56-60 and 8 1/2 games out of contention for a wild-card spot. They would have to pass four teams that they are now trailing to get in the playoffs -- an unlikely scenario.\n\nThe Giants (47-72) are completely out of it with the third-worst record in the majors. And San Francisco's best player, All-Star catcher Buster Posey, has not had much success in 41 career games against the Marlins, batting .262 with just two homers.\n\nOn Monday, the Marlins will start second-year left-hander Adam Conley (4-5, 5.43 ERA), and the Giants will throw rookie lefty Ty Blach (8-7, 4.15).\n\nConley has lost his past two starts. He allowed a season-high 11 hits and five runs in five innings Wednesday at Washington.\n\nBlach is 2-0 in August and has pitched at least seven innings in five consecutive starts. He pitches to contact, averaging just 4.4 strikeouts per nine innings and 9.7 hits. However, he doesn't walk many (1.9 per nine) and gives up few homers -- just two in his past seven starts.\n\nThere is not much past history to go on for Conley against the Giants -- just one meeting. He got a no-decision after allowing four runs in 5 2/3 innings at San Francisco on April 24, 2016.\n\nBlach, who has never faced Miami, will very quickly have to figure out how to slow Stanton, who comes up second in the batting order.\n\nFor his career, Stanton has 101 homers at Marlins Park and 250 overall. He moved ahead of Mickey Mantle into 16th place in major league history for the most long balls in a player's first eight years. Since 1913, Stanton is the sixth-fastest player to reach 250 homers.\n\nStanton also leads the majors with 19 go-ahead homers this year, a Marlins single-season record.\n\n\"He's getting up there with a lot of confidence, and he's swinging the bat well,\" Mattingly said. \"He's getting pitches to hit.\n\n\"You want to stretch out this (hot streak) as long as it will go because there are days coming where you get shut down.\"\n\nThe Giants hope that starts Monday with Blach and with pitchers such as former Marlins reliever Sam Dyson and closer Mark Melancon, who came off the disabled list on Saturday.\n\nMelancon, who hadn't pitched since June 27 due to an elbow injury, threw a scoreless inning Saturday night against Washington.\n\n\"This hasn't been easy,\" Melancon said. \"It was a tough couple of weeks on the DL, but I'm excited to get out there again.\"\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy said he would try to ease Melancon back into high-leverage situations. In the meantime, Dyson will serve as the closer.\n\nDyson has nine saves in his past 10 chances. He also has a 2.13 ERA in 24 appearances for San Francisco.\n\nThe Giants, who played three games in 24 hours, including a doubleheader that they split with the Nationals on Sunday, surely will be a tired team when they arrive in Miami without the benefit of a day off on the current road trip.\n\nSan Francisco has also yet to name a starter for the Wednesday series finale against the Marlins.\n\nMatt Cain, who hasn't started a game since July 31, is the likely choice. Albert Suarez, who started 12 games for the Giants last year, is another option. Suarez has made six big-league appearances this season, all in relief, including Sunday night, when he allowed a walk-off grand slam to Washington's Howie Kendrick in the 11th inning.\n\nMeanwhile, Mattingly said Marlins reliever Kyle Barraclough (shoulder impingement) is nearing a return from the disabled list. That could happen during the Giants series, according to the Miami manager.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "type":

With Jon Gray set to face Jose Urena in the pitching matchup, the over/under currently sits at 8.5 runs.\n\nMLB Quick Links: Scores & Matchups | Injuries | Odds Comparison | Betting Trends | ATS Stats\n\nFrom Rotoworld: Gray delivered seven innings of one-run ball Saturday in the Rockies' 8-5 victory over the Phillies. Gray carved his way easily through the Phillies' star-less lineup, scattering six hits and one walk while striking out four. The one run he allowed came on a double-play groundout by Nick Williams in the top of the fourth. Gray has been sharp lately and looks poised for a strong finish to an injury-plagued 2017 campaign. Up next is a road start against the Marlins.\n\nUrena delivered six innings of one-run ball Sunday in the Marlins' 4-1 win over the Braves. Miami jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the top of the first inning, allowing Urena to cruise comfortably through the Braves' batting order. The young right-hander gave up just three hits and one walk while punching out three, and Atlanta's only run of the afternoon came on a sixth-inning RBI single by Ender Inciarte. Urena is now 10-5 with a 3.70 ERA, 1.19 WHIP, and 79/41 K/BB ratio in 114 1/3 innings this season. A start at home against the Rockies comes next.\n\nBet Tonight's Rockies vs. Marlins Game\n\nOUR PREDICTION: The Rockies are 3-7 in Gray's last 10 starts versus National League East opponents, are 6-19 in his last 25 road outings, and are 1-7 in his last eight road starts versus a team with a losing record. On the other side, the Marlins are 5-2 in their last seven home games, are 11-4 in Urena's last 15 starts, and are 6-1 in his last seven outings after scoring two runs or less in their previous game.\n\nFRIDAY MLB PREDICTION: MIAMI MARLINS -105\n\nRecent MLB Discussions Mlb for sun on Sun, Aug 2017 by Michael CashMLB Betting News and Notes Sunday, August 13th, 2017 on Sun, Aug 2017 by BladeMLB Trends Sunday, August 13th, 2017 on Sun, Aug 2017 by BladeMlb for Sat.

Tampa Bay is coming off of a series win against Cincinnati, where they won two out of three games.

Cabrera has allowed at least three earned runs in three of his last five starts. The projected starting pitcher for Tampa Bay is Jeffrey Springs, who is making his first start of the season.\n\nWhy the Rays will beat the Marlins\n\nThe Rays have won each of their last 10 Tuesday games against the Marlins. The Marlins have lost seven of their last eight games at Tropicana Field. The Rays have covered the run line each of their last seven night games against NL East opponents that held a losing record. The Marlins have failed to cover the run line in five of their last six games following a road loss.\n\nTotal Runs Facts\n\nEach of the Marlins' last eight games against AL East opponents have gone OVER the total runs line. Each of the Rays' last six games as home favorites have gone UNDER the total runs line. The 'Inning 1 UNDER 0.5 runs' market has hit in each of the Marlins' last five road games against AL East opponents.\n\nTampa Bay Rays Player Prop Facts\n\nBrandon Lowe has hit a home run in five of his last six Tuesday appearances. Josh Lowe has recorded a Double in three of his last four appearances against NL East opponents that held a losing record. Jose Siri has recorded at least one RBI in five of the Rays' last six night games against NL East opponents that held a losing record. Yandy Diaz has recorded two or more hits in each of his last nine Tuesday night appearances against NL teams that held a losing record. Yandy Diaz has recorded two or more total bases in each of his 10 previous Tuesday night appearances against NL teams that held a losing record. Brandon Lowe has scored at least one run in five of his last six appearances against NL East opponents. Yandy Diaz has recorded at least one Single in seven of the Rays' last eight night games against NL opponents that held a losing record.\n\nMiami Marlins Player Prop Facts\n\nJosh Bell has hit a home run in four of the Marlins' last five games against opponents that held a winning record. Bryan De La Cruz has recorded at least one RBI in each of the Marlins' last five games. Josh Bell has recorded two or more total bases in each of the Marlins' last five night games.

Josh Bell has recorded at least one hit in each of the Marlins' last eight night games against opponents that held a winning record. Nick Gordon has scored a run in each of his last five appearances against AL East opponents that held a winning record.\n\nMiami Marlins vs Tampa Bay Rays Prediction\n\nTampa Bay comes into this series playing very well, but they are still fourth in the AL East and three games out of a wild card spot. The Rays are 29-28 at home this year, while the Marlins are 17-33 on the road. Miami is playing some of their best baseball of the season right now and their offense is scoring a ton of runs over the last week. The Marlins will look to continue their momentum here, but they are starting Edward Cabrera, who has been pretty bad this season. I know Springs is seeing his first action of the season, but I have to fade the Marlins on the road. My Miami Marlins vs Tampa Bay Rays prediction is for the Rays to win and cover the run line.\n\nDavid's Pick Rays -1.5\n\nGet Premium Picks Start Winning Now \"\n\nThe pick in this article is the opinion of the writer, not a PickDawgz site consensus.\n\nAUTHOR: David Racey\n\nDavid will find the winners to make you a profit.

Despite the Marlins' historical struggles against the Rays, Miami has a solid chance to come out on top.\n\nEdward Cabrera, the 26-year-old right-hander, has shown flashes of brilliance this season. While his overall stats (1-3 W-L, 7.04 ERA) may not seem impressive, a deeper dive reveals his potential. Cabrera has a career strikeout rate of 26.2% and has been particularly effective in recent outings. In his last five appearances, he posted a 2.38 ERA with 25 strikeouts over 22.2 innings, allowing just one home run. This resurgence indicates that Cabrera is finding his form at a crucial time.\n\nOn the other side, Jeffrey Springs has had his share of injury woes. After undergoing Tommy John surgery, Springs will be making his 2024 season debut after finally coming off the Disabled List.\n\nThe Marlins' offense has also been stepping up, averaging 4.0 runs per game in their last five outings against the Rays. While the Rays have a strong historical record against the Marlins, the combination of Edward Cabrera's recent form, Jeffrey Springs' injury concerns, and Miami's offensive momentum makes the Marlins a formidable opponent on Tuesday night. Expect Cabrera to leverage his strikeout potential and the Marlins' recent successes to lead Miami to a crucial road victory.\n\nWhy The Rays Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nAs the Tampa Bay Rays prepare to host the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night, all signs point to another victory for the home team. With Jeffrey Springs on the mound and the Rays' historical dominance over their in-state rivals, Tampa Bay is primed to continue their winning ways.\n\nThe Rays have consistently leveraged their home-field advantage at Tropicana Field, and this matchup should be no different. Tampa Bay boasts an impressive 40-27 record against the Marlins at home, showcasing their comfort and effectiveness in the unique environment of the Trop. The DEX Imaging Home Plate Club provides an electric atmosphere that energizes both players and fans alike.\n\nWhile Jeffrey Springs has faced injury setbacks, his return to the mound is a welcome sight for Rays fans. Springs, known for his career 3.40 ERA, has shown flashes of his pre-injury form. His ability to mix pitches and keep hitters off-balance will be crucial against a Marlins lineup that has struggled against Tampa Bay pitching.\n\nThe Rays have absolutely owned this matchup, holding a commanding 80-59 overall record against the Marlins. Even more impressively, Tampa Bay has won 11 of their last 12 games against Miami, including a perfect 4-0 record in 2022. This psychological edge cannot be understated as the Marlins step into hostile territory.\n\nWhile Edward Cabrera has shown potential, his 4.24 ERA in 2023 indicates inconsistency. Facing a potent Rays lineup in their home park presents a significant challenge for the young right-hander. The Rays' patient approach at the plate could force Cabrera into high-stress situations early in the game.\n\nWhile Edward Cabrera has shown potential, his 4.24 ERA in 2023 indicates inconsistency. Facing a potent Rays lineup in their home park presents a significant challenge for the young right-hander. The Rays' patient approach at the plate could force Cabrera into high-stress situations early in the game.\n\nThe combination of the Rays' home field advantage, Jeffrey Springs' potential for a strong outing, and their historical success against the Marlins make Tampa Bay the clear favorite on Tuesday night. Expect the Rays to continue their dominance and secure another victory in this in-state rivalry.\n\nFinal Marlins-Rays Prediction & Pick\n\nDespite Cabrera's recent improvements, the Rays hold a significant edge in this contest. Tampa Bay's historical dominance over Miami, winning 80 of 139 matchups, coupled with their strong home-field advantage at Tropicana Field, tilts the scales in their favor. While Springs is coming off an injury, his career 3.40 ERA suggests he could outperform Cabrera, who has struggled with consistency. Given these factors, I predict the Rays will emerge victorious, leveraging their home-field advantage and historical success against the Marlins.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Springs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Springs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropicana Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Marlins-vs.-Rays-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775094", "eventUri": "eng-9775094", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nMiami Marlins DFS Spin\n\nMarlins first baseman Jake Burger had a multi-hit game in his club's 9-3 loss to the Rays on Tuesday. In that game, the right-handed hitter from St. Louis went 2 for 5 with a homer, an RBI, and a run scored. In 347 plate appearances this year, Jake Burger is hitting .235 with 14 homers, 40 RBIs, and a .691 OPS. The big corner infielder is hitting .294 with an OPS of 1.047 over the past 15 days, making him an interesting DFS option on Wednesday.\n\nTampa Bay Rays DFS Spin\n\nRays third baseman Jose Caballero reached base 3 times in his team's 9-3 win over the Marlins on Tuesday. In that contest, Caballero went 2 for 4 with 2 doubles, an RBI, a run scored, a stolen base, and a walk. For the season, the 5'9\" right-handed hitter from Panama is batting .240 with 7 homers, 28 RBIs, 28 stolen bases, and a .671 OPS across 322 plate appearances. Caballero is hitting .255 with 5 homers and a .771 OPS during day games this season. That means he could have some DFS value during his club's matinee matchup with the Marlins on Wednesday.\n\nTampa Bay is 18-12 ATS in interleague games this season.\n\nMiami has the second-worst straight-up record in the National League this season at 39-68. The Marlins' run differential of -148 is the second-worst in the senior circuit as well. The trade deadline just passed on Tuesday night, and the Marlins made a big splash by trading away several significant players. Before the deadline, Miami shipped out relief pitcher A.J. Puk and infielder Jazz Chisholm.\n\nOn Tuesday the Marlins continued the fire sale by trading away closer Tanner Scott, first baseman Josh Bell, outfielder Bryan De La Cruz, and starting pitcher Trevor Rogers. Miami also moved relief pitchers Bryan Hoeing, JT Chargois, and Huascar Brazoban. The Marlins weren't good before the deadline and figure to be significantly worse after it.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- It had been 475 days since Jeffrey Springs last took the mound with the Rays. Tuesday night, the lefty finally returned to the majors after hybrid Tommy John surgery and a long rehab to rejoin the rotation just as the MLB trade deadline closed.\n\nAfter dealing away veterans like Zach Eflin, Jason Adam and Randy Arozarena, Springs returned to a team looking to build off this rotation with him at the front.\n\nSprings did not factor in the decision but got the Rays off to a good start as they rallied later for an 9-3 win over the Marlins in front of an announced crowd of 17,931 at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe Rays (55-52) tied a season-high three games above .500 with the win, back there for the first time since May 19. The Marlins (39-68), who had their roster decimated by trades, dropped their second straight game.\n\nChristopher Morel homered in his first game with the Rays, after being acquired from the Cubs in a trade that sent Isaac Paredes to Chicago. Ben Rortvedt and Yandy Diaz each drove in two, and Josh Lowe drove in another in the Rays' five-run sixth inning. Jose Caballero drove in a run and stole home in the seventh when Marlins catcher Nick Fortes could not hold on to the throw home. Brandon Lowe drove in another in the eighth.\n\nSprings allowed two runs on six hits over 3 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out three on 76 pitches. Springs, who was the hottest pitcher out of the gate in 2023 before his injury, generated 10 swings and misses; not surprisingly, six of those came on his change-up.\n\nXavier Edwards jumped on Springs early, driving the second pitch of the game for a line-drive single. With one out, Marlins designated hitter Emmanuel Rivera hammered a two-run homer.\n\nAfter that, Springs was able to hold off Miami, until he loaded the bases in the fourth and was replaced by Tyler Alexander, who got the Rays out of the inning unscathed.\n\nIn the top of the fifth, Jake Burger homered off Alexander for Miami's third run.\n\nIt was a start, if not the sharp Springs the Rays saw last season.\n\n\"Everyone on that comeback trail, they really got to work just as hard in their rehab as they do when they're healthy and Jeffrey Springs holds himself to a really high standard. He wants to go out here and be the same guy he was before the injury and we want that as well. But we're certainly going to show the patience to allow him to continue to build toward that,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said prior to the game.\n\nSprings was dominant in the spring of 2023 and had allowed just one earned run in three regular-season starts. He had struck out 24 over 16 1/3 innings.\n\n\u00a92024 Tampa Bay Times. Visit tampabay.com.

PETERSBURG -- It had been 475 days since Jeffrey Spring last took the mound with the Rays. Tuesday night, the lefty finally returned to the majors after hybrid Tommy John surgery and a long rehab to rejoin the rotation just as the MLB trade deadline closed.\n\nAfter dealing away veterans like Zach Eflin, Jason Adam and Randy Arozarena, Springs returned to a team looking to build off this rotation with him at the front.\n\nSprings did not factor in the decision but got the Rays off to a good start as they rallied later for an 9-3 win over the Marlins in front of an announced crowd of 17,931 at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe Rays (55-52) tied a season-high three games above .500 with the win, back there for the first time since May 19. The Marlins (39-68), who had their roster decimated by trades, dropped their second straight game.\n\nChristopher Morel homered in his first game with the Rays, after being acquired from the Cubs in a trade that sent Isaac Paredes to Chicago. Ben Rortvedt and Yandy Diaz each drove in two, and Josh Lowe drove in another in the Rays' five-run sixth inning. Jose Caballero drove in a run and stole home in the seventh when Marlins catcher Nick Fortes could not hold on to the throw home. Brandon Lowe drove in another in the eighth.\n\nSprings allowed two runs on six hits over 3 \u2154 innings. He walked one and struck out three on 76 pitches. Springs, who was the hottest pitcher out of the gate in 2023 before his injury, generated 10 swings and misses; not surprisingly, six of those came on his changeup.\n\nXavier Edwards jumped on Springs early, driving the second pitch of the game for a line-drive single. With one out, Marlins designated hitter Emmanuel Rivera hammered a two-run homer.\n\nAfter that, Springs was able to hold off Miami, until he loaded the bases in the fourth and was replaced by Tyler Alexander, who got the Rays out of the inning unscathed.\n\nIn the top of the fifth, Jake Burger homered off Alexander for Miami's third run.\n\nIt was a start, if not the sharp Springs the Rays saw last season.\n\n\"Everyone on that comeback trail, they really got to work just as hard in their rehab as they do when they're healthy and Jeffrey Springs holds himself to a really high standard. He wants to go out here and be the same guy he was before the injury and we want that as well. But we're certainly going to show the patience to allow him to continue to build toward that,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said prior to the game.\n\nSprings was dominant in the spring of 2023 and had allowed just one earned run in three regular-season starts. He had struck out 24 over 16 1/3 innings.\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

The deal was one of several the Rays made the past week with an eye on positioning themselves for success in coming years.\n\nWith three straight wins, though, Tampa Bay (55-52) also has climbed three games over .500 for the first time in two months and is back in contention for a wild-card playoff berth.\n\nThe Marlins (39-68) were also sellers before the trade deadline, moving third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. to the New York Yankees last week and moving infielder Josh Bell and pitchers Tanner Scott, Trevor Rogers and JT Chargois in deals Tuesday.\n\nLeft-hander Jeffrey Springs returned from Tommy John surgery, making his first start since April 2023 for the Rays. He allowed a two-run homer to Emmanuel Rivera in the first innings and yielded six hits while striking out three over 3 2/3 innings.\n\nMarlins: Cabrera left the game two pitches into the sixth inning. He appeared to motion with his glove for catcher Nick Fortes to approach the mound and was replaced by Cronin after a brief discussion with manager Skip Schumaker. There was no immediate announcement on why he was removed.\n\nRays: Springs made his first start since April 13, 2023, against the Boston Red Sox, a span of 474 days. He threw 76 pitches, 46 for strikes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRight-hander Taj Bradley (6-4, 2.43 ERA) starts the finale of a two-game series for Tampa Bay.

Like, second base, third base, I'm good to be there.\"\n\nThe Marlins were busy before the Tuesday afternoon trade deadline, dealing first baseman Josh Bell, outfielder Bryan De La Cruz, starting pitcher Trevor Rogers and relief pitchers Tanner Scott, JT Chargois, Bryan Hoeing and Huascar Brazoban on Tuesday.\n\nThat was three days after Miami dealt 2022 All-Star outfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. to the New York Yankees.\n\n\"Found out during BP a couple moves were happening,\" Miami manager Skip Schumaker said after the Tuesday game. \"It gives an opportunity for some of these guys that were maybe coming off the bench or picked up off waivers or whatever it is.\"\n\nOne of those who will be tough to replace is Scott, who had 18 of Miami's 20 saves this season.\n\nSchumaker said he expects relievers Andrew Nardi, Anthony Bender, Calvin Faucher and Declan Cronin to compete for the closing role, but all four will be used in the most high-leverage situations.\n\n\"I don't know if other guys are coming up,\" Schumaker said. \"I don't know really what's happening, but those four have been really good, so I anticipate them getting the bulk of the leverage or when we're in the lead.\"\n\nSchumaker said he still has plenty of faith in Cronin, who was rushed out of the bullpen in the sixth inning on Tuesday after starter Edward Cabrera exited due to a left knee injury.\n\nCronin ended up allowing four runs and three hits in one inning, taking the loss.\n\n\"He's going to be fine,\" Schumaker said of Cronin. \"Just one tough outing.\"\n\nThe extent of Cabrera's injury was uncertain after the game. The right-hander sustained the injury while leaping to catch a throw from first baseman Jake Burger while covering first.\n\n\"We'll figure it out after testing (Wednesday),\" Schumaker said.\n\nMiami plans to start rookie Roddery Munoz (1-5, 5.61 ERA) on Wednesday. The right-hander is 0-5 with a 6.30 ERA in his past 10 appearances (nine starts).\n\nHe most recently allowed six runs and six hits in five innings during a no-decision against the visiting Baltimore Orioles on Thursday. Munoz has not faced Tampa Bay.\n\nThe Rays plan to start right-hander Taj Bradley on Wednesday. Bradley (6-4, 2.43 ERA) enters with a 23-inning scoreless streak, including his past three starts.\n\nBradley joined a list featuring Ryan Yarbrough, Jake Odorizzi, and Alex Cobb as the only Tampa Bay pitchers to throw at least six scoreless innings in three straight starts.\n\nBradley has never faced Miami in his two major league seasons.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@fresnobee.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Morel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Morel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Schumaker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skip Schumaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bell_(first_baseman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Bell (first baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Bender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_De_La_Cruz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan De La Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Rogers_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Rogers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Chargois", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

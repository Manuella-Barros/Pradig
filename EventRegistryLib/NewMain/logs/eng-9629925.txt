The team has made four straight NCAA Tournament appearances and won the 2023 and 2024 national titles with dominant March Madness runs. With a title game win over Purdue in April, UConn became the first team to successfully defend a national title since the Florida Gators in 2006 and 2007.\n\nBefore taking the helm at UConn, Hurley coached at Wagner (2010-12) and Rhode Island (2012-18).\n\nFormer NBA player and current ESPN analyst J.J. Redick and New Orleans Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego have also been linked to the Lakers' head coach opening. Wojnarowski reported that Hurley has been \"at the forefront\" of the Lakers' search, even though they have done \"due diligence\" with other candidates.\n\nThe Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on May 3. Ham held the job for just two seasons, both of which ended with playoff defeats against the Denver Nuggets. The team went 47-35 in the regular season, earned the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference through the NBA Play-In Tournament and fell to the Nuggets in a five-game series in the first round.\n\nHurley has already earned the stamp of approval from one Lakers star. LeBron James raved about Hurley in a social media post on April 19, saying, \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nOn top of the NBA significance, the Lakers hiring Hurley would send shockwaves throughout college basketball. Hurley inked a six-year contract with UConn months after his first national championship in 2023. UConn would then begin a coaching search months after several major college coaching changes, including John Calipari heading to Arkansas and Mark Pope replacing Calipari at Kentucky.", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Gators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2024/06/web-240606-dan-hurley-uconn.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1367, "textEnd": 1372}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1803, "textEnd": 1811}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

The Lakers fired Darvin Ham after their season ended, and all signs pointed to JJ Redick becoming the next head coach in Los Angeles. A report from The Athletic's Shams Charania on Wednesday even said that the Lakers were 'zeroing in on' Redick to become the next head. Then, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Thursday that the Lakers are preparing a huge offer to UConn basketball head coach Dan Hurley.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley as the franchise's next coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer to bring the back-to-back NCAA national champion to the NBA, sources told ESPN,\" The report from Adrian Wojnarowski said. \"The Lakers have had preliminary contact with Hurley and the sides are planning to escalate discussions in the coming days, sources told ESPN. Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said.\"\n\nThis news was surprising for the whole basketball world to see, especially because Dan Hurley made it clear that he wanted to stay with UConn basketball. Hurley and the Huskies have won the last two national championships, and there have been other teams trying to sway Hurley away this offseason.\n\nKentucky basketball had an opening earlier in the offseason, and Hurley was mentioned as a potential target for the job. He made it very clear that he wanted to stay at UConn, and he was confident that his team next year was going to be very good. Now, after the Lakers news, that quote is picking up a lot of traction.\n\n\"We're going to be one of the best teams again,\" Dan Hurley said, according to a tweet from Gavin Keefe. \"We're very, very confident.\"\n\nThe Lakers offer is an attractive one\n\nIf there was one job in basketball that could sway Dan Hurley away from the UConn basketball team, it's probably this one. He would get a ton of money, and he would have a long-term contract. Hurley would be set up nicely, so it would make sense if this was the job that lured him away from college hoops.\n\nHurley is confident that UConn will have one of the best teams in college basketball next season, but if he leaves, that obviously changes. Not only will the Huskies have to find a replacement for arguably the best coach in college basketball, but the transfer portal would also open up for UConn players. When a head coach leaves, players have one month to enter their name into the portal if that is what they want.\n\nIf Dan Hurley goes to the Lakers, this UConn team could end up looking completely different next season, from a player and coach standpoint. Right now, we just know that the Lakers are reportedly prepared to give Hurley a big offer, but that doesn't mean that he is for sure going to leave UConn. We'll know who the next coach in Los Angeles will be soon enough.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dan-Hurleys-confident-quote-goes-viral-after-Lakers-stunner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

The Lakers are preparing a \"massive, long-term contract offer\" to Hurley and have had preliminary contact about the position already. Hurley's camp and the Lakers are \"planning to escalate discussions\" in the near future, ESPN adds.\n\nThe Lakers fired Darvin Ham in May after just two seasons and JJ Redick -- co-host of a podcast with Lakers star LeBron James, a broadcaster with ESPN and a long-time player first at Duke then in the NBA for nearly two decades -- was believed to be the frontrunner for the position. However, Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Hurley has been the target throughout the process. From ESPN:\n\nHurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said.\n\nLakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka and governor Jeanie Buss are eager to formally discuss with Hurley their vision of marrying his dominant program -- built upon both his tactical acumen and elite player development -- with the storied Lakers brand, sources said.\n\nHurley earlier this offseason turned down overtures from the University of Kentucky, one of the best jobs in college basketball because of its history and resources, after the school and John Calipari went separate directions. He later said he had no desire to coach college basketball anywhere else before adding that trying his hand at the NBA later in his career interests him.\n\nAfter leading UConn to a national championship in 2023, Hurley signed a six-year deal worth $32.1 million that vaulted him into the top-10 highest-paid college coaches. Then Hurley, 51, led the Huskies to another championship this spring, becoming the first to go back-to-back since Billy Donovan did it with Florida in 2006 and 2007. Hurley and UConn have been in talks -- but not yet agreed to -- a deserved new deal that would result in a pay bump for him and his coaching staff.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_boone@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Boone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kentucky", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/03/31/80c6d30f-76a2-40ef-aace-188582b7d7af/thumbnail/1200x675/26ea4f85f7a988716da096bdf4f63397/usatsi-22908112-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Hurley is currently in high demand as a head coach for college basketball, and the Los Angeles Lakers could be the frontrunner.\n\nA new development has emerged regarding the former national champion's future at UConn, even as he prepares for a third consecutive title. According to a recent report from NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski, the Los Angeles Lakers are allegedly considering hiring Hurley as their next head coach.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski tweeted on X: \"The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting Connecticut's Dan Hurley to become the franchise's next coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer to bring the back-to-back national champion to the NBA,\"\n\nOwner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka had already made first contact with Hurley. However, it is anticipated that the two parties will shortly intensify their talks.\n\nThe claim is surprising given that J.J. Redick, a former standout player for the Duke Blue Devils, was thought to be the front-runner to become the Lakers' head coach. According to Wojnarowski, Hurley will also join the Lakers this summer on a big, long-term contract.\n\nSince joining the UConn Huskies program in 2018, Hurley has expanded it. Hurley has indeed led UConn to tremendous success during the previous six seasons.\n\nUnder Hurley's direction, the Huskies have received four straight berths in the NCAA Tournament. According to the UConn website, in addition to his two national titles, Hurley has delivered one conference and one regular-season championship to Connecticut.\n\nIn 2024-25, Hurley can go down in college basketball history as one of the best head coaches ever. After all, it is anticipated that Hurley will lead the Huskies to a three-peat. With his experience, he might push back the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHurley would need a deal worth at least $15 million annually to entice him away from UConn. Kansas' Bill Self makes over $10 million yearly and hasn't won a title. Meanwhile, the UConn head coach hopes to make it three in a row.

The team has made four straight NCAA Tournament appearances and won the 2023 and 2024 national titles with dominant March Madness runs. With a title game win over Purdue in April, UConn became the first team to successfully defend a national title since the Florida Gators in 2006 and 2007.\n\nPrior to taking the helm at UConn, Hurley was a high school coach at St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, New Jersey, before taking head coaching positions at Wagner (2010-12) and Rhode Island (2012-18).\n\nFormer NBA player and current ESPN analyst J.J. Redick, New Orleans Pelicans assistant head coach James Borrego, Boston Celtics assistant coach Sam Cassell and Denver Nuggets assistant head coach David Adelman have already interviewed for the Lakers' head coach opening. Wojnarowski reported that Hurley has been \"at the forefront\" of the Lakers' search from the beginning, even though they have done \"due diligence\" with other candidates.\n\nThe Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on May 3. Ham held the job for just two seasons, both of which ended with playoff defeats against the Denver Nuggets. The team went 47-35 in the regular season, earned the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference through the NBA Play-In Tournament and fell to the Nuggets in a five-game series in the first round.\n\nHurley has already earned the stamp of approval from one Lakers star. LeBron James raved about Hurley in a social media post on April 19, saying, \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nOn top of the NBA significance, the Lakers hiring Hurley would send shockwaves throughout college basketball. Hurley inked a six-year contract with UConn months after his first national championship in 2023. UConn would then begin a coaching search months after several major college coaching changes, including John Calipari heading to Arkansas and Mark Pope replacing Calipari at Kentucky.", "source":

Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said.\n\nLakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka and governor Jeanie Buss are eager to formally discuss with Hurley their vision of marrying his dominant program -- built upon his tactical acumen and his elite player development -- with the storied Lakers brand, sources said.\n\nHurley, 51, has often described his ambition to one day coach in the NBA and has expressed to the Lakers a desire to explore the full picture of a partnership with one of basketball's winningest franchises, sources said.\n\nThe pursuit of Hurley comes on the 20th anniversary of the Lakers trying to hire then-Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski to a record-breaking contract in 2004. Krzyzewski elected to remain with the Blue Devils, but the climate has dramatically changed in college athletics. The demands of NIL fundraising for non-power-football schools such as UConn are an especially relentless grind -- and are expected to become even more difficult.\n\nAs for the Lakers' stars, LeBron James has been impressed with Hurley's sophisticated offensive actions. Assuming James returns to L.A. in free agency, the possibility of using the 55th pick in this month's NBA draft on USC freshman guard Bronny James makes Hurley an even more intriguing candidate. If that happens, James gets a chance to play with his son and the benefit of Hurley and his staff becoming responsible for Bronny's pro development.\n\nIn a social media post responding to a podcast interview with JJ Redick, James posted on X about Hurley: \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their [offense]. Love it.\"\n\nThe Lakers have been committed to making All-NBA forward Anthony Davis a significant part of the conversation on the next head coach and want to make sure he's aligned with how a new coach plans to feature him on offense and defense, sources said.\n\nThe Lakers have had several interviews with other candidates, including New Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego, Redick, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell and Denver Nuggets assistant David Adelman, sources said. The Lakers have proceeded with conversations with other candidates over the past few weeks, but the potential of landing Hurley has been the focus of the Lakers' search, sources said.\n\nPart of the allure of Hurley traces back to the changing landscape of NBA roster building under the collective bargaining agreement. Because of the roster-building limitations of the new second apron, the ability of big-market teams to construct contending rosters by trading multiple draft picks and young players for a third star player has largely been eliminated. Beyond the 17th pick in this month's draft, the Lakers have a young core of Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Max Christie that management believes can still show even greater improvement under Hurley's coaching, sources said.\n\nAfter historically dominant back-to-back national title seasons, Hurley has emerged as the most coveted coach in the sport -- and the possibility of him leaving UConn and the Big East Conference for the Lakers has massive implications for college basketball and for the NBA. Hurley has constructed a juggernaut that has lapped the sport -- culminating with the NCAA's first repeat champion in 17 years and a tournament performance that produced the biggest point differential in tournament history: 140 points.\n\nThe possibility of UConn winning a third straight title looms with the return of a preseason top-five team, but the Huskies did lose two lottery picks (center Donovan Clingan and guard Stephon Castle) and a first-team All-America point guard (Tristen Newton) to the NBA draft.\n\nThe Lakers dismissed coach Darvin Ham after a first-round exit in the Western Conference playoffs. Ham was 94-70 in two seasons -- including a trip to the Western Conference finals in 2023.\n\nHurley is 141-58 (.709) in six seasons as the UConn coach, and he holds an NCAA tournament record of 12 consecutive double-digit victories.

The Lakers are targeting the Huskies coach to be their next coach, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nUConn has won back-to-back NCAA tournaments under Hurley over the last two seasons and the Lakers are preparing a \"massive\" long-term contract offer to bring Hurley to the NBA. The Lakers are looking for a new head coach after firing Darvin Ham following their first-round loss to the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThere have been plenty of names mentioned regarding the Lakers' search, with former NBA player and Duke star J.J. Redick at the top of the list. They have reportedly interviewed a number of candidates, including Redick, Denver Nuggets assistant coach David Adelman, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell and Charlotte Hornet assistant James Borrego.\n\nHowever, Hurley has been the top target for the Lakers and negotiations are expected to escalate in the coming days.\n\nHurley, 51, would lead a team that includes LeBron James and Anthony Davis as its cornerstones. The Lakers believe they have the pieces in place to make another run at the NBA title and Hurley is the coach who can guide the squad.\n\nJames, who turns 40 in December, is expected to pick up his player option and return to the Lakers next season. The Lakers also are \"committed\" to making Anthony Davis a \"significant part\" of the conversation to hire a new coach to make sure they are in agreement with how he will be used on offense and defense.\n\nJames has been impressed with Hurley \"sophisticated offensive actions\" during his time with the Huskies, according to the report. James also praised Hurley on social media following the coach's appearance on a podcast with Redick on April 19.\n\n\"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their [offense].

Hurley's player development skills and track record make him a coveted NBA coaching option. A potential hire could please LeBron James, especially as his son Bronny enters the NBA Draft.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly zeroing in on their top candidate to become their new head coach: Dan Hurley.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Lakers are preparing a \"massive offer\" to Hurley, the current coach of the University of Connecticut men's basketball team, to fill their head coaching vacancy.\n\nWojnarowski reports that Hurley and the Lakers have been in touch and are preparing to ramp up discussions in the coming days. Lakers owner Jeannie Buss and GM Rob Pelinka are reportedly eager to sell their vision to Hurley.\n\nThe Lakers fired Darvin Ham in April after two seasons, a 94-70 record, and a Western Conference Finals appearance in 2022-23.\n\nWojnarowski reports that Hurley is interested in making the leap from college to the NBA.\n\nHurley has overseen back-to-back national championships with the Huskies and has a 141-58 record over six seasons with Connecticut, including a combined 68-11 record over the past two seasons. Prior to joining UConn, Hurley coached at Wagner and Rhode Island, where he made the NCAA Tournament in his final two seasons.\n\nWojnarowski described Hurley as \"the most coveted coach in the sport\" because of his player development acumen and Connecticut's recent dominance.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the Lakers have interviewed other candidates, including New Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell, Denver Nuggets assistant David Adelman, as well as former NBA veteran JJ Redick.\n\nThursday's report comes just days after The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that the Lakers were making Redick their \"frontrunner\" for the head coaching job. Redick, who has not coached in the NBA, also interviewed for the Charlotte Hornets head coaching job.\n\nThere had been speculation in the NBA world that Redick would be a LeBron James-approved hire, because of their relationship discussing basketball philosophy on their \"Mind the Game\" podcast.\n\nDoes Hurley Have the LeBron James Stamp of Approval? James has shown admiration for Hurley before\n\nIf the Lakers do indeed land Hurley, it's a move that should please LeBron James.\n\nAs Wojnarowski notes, James took to X (formerly Twitter) this past spring to praise Hurley.\n\nFurthermore, with James' son Bronny declaring for the NBA draft and viewed as a second-round pick, Hurley's skills at player development could benefit Bronny at the NBA level (if the Lakers draft Bronny with their 55th pick in the draft, as is rumored).\n\nJames is set to hit free agency this summer for the first time in 2019. James has given no hints that he will leave the Lakers, and many in the NBA world are skeptical that James would move to another franchise in his 22nd season, as he turns 40 years old in December. However, the threat still lingers over the Lakers' offseason.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the Lakers have also made Anthony Davis a \"significant part\" of their head-coaching search. Davis, 31, signed a three-year, $186 million extension last summer, tying him to the Lakers through 2028.\n\nStill, coaching for the Lakers has proven to be an uphill battle over the last decade. No head coach has lasted more than three seasons with the Lakers since Phil Jackson coached his second stint with the team, from 2005-2011.\n\nRelated Lakers' 'Dream' Trade Target in 2024 NBA Offseason Revealed The Los Angeles Lakers are linked to a \"dream' trade scenario for another All-Star to form a trio with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cassell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-28-may-2024-12-20-pm-177.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said.\n\nLakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka and governor Jeanie Buss are eager to formally discuss with Hurley their vision of marrying his dominant program -- built upon both his tactical acumen and elite player development -- with the storied Lakers' brand, sources said.\n\nHurley, 51, has often described his ambition to one day coach in the NBA and has expressed to the Lakers a desire to explore the full picture of a partnership with one of basketball's winningest franchises, sources said.\n\nThe pursuit of Hurley comes on the 20th anniversary of the Lakers trying to hire then-Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski to a record-breaking contract in 2004. Krzyzewski elected to remain with the Blue Devils, but the climate has dramatically changed in college athletics and the demands of NIL fundraising for non-power football schools like UConn are an especially relentless grind -- and expected to become even more difficult.\n\nAs for the Lakers' stars, LeBron James has been impressed with Hurley's sophisticated offensive actions, and assuming he returns to L.A. in free agency, the possibility of using the 55th overall pick in this month's NBA draft on USC freshman guard Bronny James makes Hurley an even more intriguing candidate. If that happens, James gets a chance to play with his son and the benefit of Hurley and his staff becoming responsible for Bronny's pro development.\n\nIn a social media post responding to a podcast interview with JJ Redick, James posted on the social media platform X about Hurley: \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their (offense). Love it.\"\n\nThe Lakers have been committed to making All-NBA forward Anthony Davis a significant part of the conversation on the next head coach and want to make sure that he's aligned with how a new coach plans to feature him on both offense and defense, sources said.\n\nThe Lakers have had several interviews with other candidates, including Charlotte Hornets assistant James Borrego, Redick, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell and Denver Nuggets assistant David Adelman, sources said. The Lakers have proceeded with conversations with other candidates over the past few weeks, but the potential of landing Hurley has been the focus of the Lakers' search, sources said.\n\nPart of the allure of Hurley traces back to the changing landscape of NBA roster building under the collective bargaining agreement. Because of the roster-building limitations of the new second-apron, the ability of big-market teams to construct contending rosters by trading multiple draft picks and young players for a third star player has largely been eliminated. Beyond the 17th overall pick in this month's draft, the Lakers have a young core of Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Max Christie that management believes can still show even greater improvement under Hurley's coaching, sources said.\n\nAfter historically dominant back-to-back national title seasons, Hurley has emerged as the most coveted coach in the sport -- and the possibility of him leaving UConn and the Big East Conference for the Lakers has massive implications for both college basketball and the NBA. Hurley has constructed a juggernaut that has lapped the sport -- culminating with the NCAA's first repeat champion in 17 years and a tournament performance that produced the biggest point differential in tournament history -- 140 points.\n\nThe possibility of UConn winning a third straight title does loom with the return of a preseason top-5 team, but the Huskies did lose two lottery picks (center Donovan Clingan and guard Stephon Castle) and a first-team All-American point guard (Tristen Newton) to the NBA draft.\n\nThe Lakers dismissed coach Darvin Ham after a first-round exit in the Western Conference playoffs. Ham was 94-70 in two seasons -- including a trip to the Western Conference Finals in 2023.\n\nHurley is 141-58 (.709) in six seasons as the UConn coach -- and holds an NCAA tournament record of 12 consecutive double digit victories. The son of Naismith Hall of Fame coach Bob Hurley Sr. -- for whom Hurley played for at famed St. Anthony High School of Jersey City, N.J. -- Dan Hurley spent nine years as a high school coach at St. Benedict's Prep before rapidly rebuilding college programs at Wagner and Rhode Island.

The team has made four straight NCAA Tournament appearances and won the 2023 and 2024 national titles with dominant March Madness runs. With a title game win over Purdue in April, UConn became the first team to successfully defend a national title since the Florida Gators in 2006 and 2007.\n\nPrior to taking the helm at UConn, Hurley was a high school coach at St. Benedict's Prep in Newark, New Jersey, before taking head coaching positions at Wagner (2010-12) and Rhode Island (2012-18).\n\nFormer NBA player and current ESPN analyst J.J. Redick, New Orleans Pelicans assistant head coach James Borrego, Boston Celtics assistant coach Sam Cassell and Denver Nuggets assistant head coach David Adelman have already interviewed for the Lakers' head coach opening. Wojnarowski reported that Hurley has been \"at the forefront\" of the Lakers' search from the beginning, even though they have done \"due diligence\" with other candidates.\n\nThe Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on May 3. Ham held the job for just two seasons, both of which ended with playoff defeats against the Denver Nuggets. The team went 47-35 in the regular season, earned the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference through the NBA Play-In Tournament and fell to the Nuggets in a five-game series in the first round.\n\nHurley has already earned the stamp of approval from one Lakers star. LeBron James raved about Hurley in a social media post on April 19, saying, \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nOn top of the NBA significance, the Lakers hiring Hurley would send shockwaves throughout college basketball. Hurley inked a six-year contract with UConn months after his first national championship in 2023.

Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN has reported that the Lakers have prepared a massive contract offer for the champion coach and are escalating talks with him in the coming days.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting UConn's Dan Hurley as the franchise's next coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer to bring the back-to-back NCAA national champion to the NBA, sources told ESPN.\"\n\n\"The Lakers have had preliminary contact with Hurley and the sides are planning to escalate discussions in the coming days. Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said.\"\n\nThis is a massive update on the Lakers head coaching search, which has been one of the biggest talking points in basketball outside the NBA Finals. JJ Redick was reportedly finalized as the new head coach according to Shams Charania, but it seems the Lakers have a far more accomplished candidate who would be a rookie head coach in the NBA.\n\nAlong with leading UConn to back-to-back NCAA titles, Hurley was named the 2024 Naismith College Coach of the Year and the 2024 BIG EAST Coach of the Year. He is 141-58 in six seasons as the UConn coach and set an NCAA tournament record of 12 consecutive double-digit victories.\n\nHurley has expressed interest in moving over to the NBA before, with the Lakers role arguably being one of the most attractive jobs in the league. Unfortunately, it carries major risk for the NCAA head coach if it fails to work, possibly closing the door to further NBA opportunities if this goes wrong.\n\nWhat Would Dan Hurley Mean For The Lakers?\n\nGetting Hurley to abandon the NCAA for the NBA would be the biggest such move since Brad Stevens joined the Boston Celtics as head coach in 2013. The team will have similar expectations under Hurley, who is known for his team-building and player-development skills.\n\nThe move could also be influenced by the new team-building strategies required in the NBA for teams to find more sustainable routes of creating a contender under new cap rules.\n\n\"Part of the allure of Hurley traces back to the changing landscape of NBA roster building under the collective bargaining agreement. Because of the roster-building limitations of the new second-apron, the ability of big-market teams to construct contending rosters by trading multiple draft picks and young players for a third star player has largely been eliminated.\"\n\n\"Beyond the 17th overall pick in this month's draft, the Lakers have a young core of Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and Max Christie that management believes can still show even greater improvement under Hurley's coaching, sources said.\"\n\nIt can be presumed that LeBron James would welcome such a move, with the 39-year-old sharing posts on social media about Hurley recently while discussing his offensive schemes on his podcast with JJ Redick.\n\nThis shouldn't eliminate Redick from the race, who might be the leading candidate for head coach if Hurley says no.\n\nThe 15-year NBA veteran would also make for a very interesting assistant coaching candidate for a staff to be built under Hurley, but all of that will be predicated on whether or not Hurley abandons the chance to three-peat and join the Lakers.\n\nRelated: JJ Redick Responds To Los Angeles Lakers Rumors\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Hurley leaving UConn straight off of its second consecutive national championship would be a massive decision. But his impressive coaching job there has set him up nicely to receive a major payday from the Lakers and the chance to prove himself at the NBA level.\n\nThe news of the Lakers' immense interest in Hurley now calls into question what happens -- or happened -- with JJ Redick. The 15-year NBA veteran and current broadcaster/podcaster has been mentioned repeatedly as a target for LA, one that the franchise was reportedly \"zeroing in\" on before Redick blasted that rumor himself.\n\nWith James and Redick's relationship so close after starting a podcast together (and playing against each other in the NBA for over a decade), how does this news of Hurley affect where the Lakers go forward with their superstar? A lot of reactions to the Hurley news suggested that it was a response to the likelihood that James, who can enter unrestricted free agency this offseason, will leave Los Angeles.\n\nPlenty of others imagined hilarious scenarios that could unfold with the incredibly intense Hurley coaching James on the Lakers.\n\nIf this news comes as a blindside to Redick and James was fully on board with him becoming L.A.'s new head coach, it may cause a rift between him and the team. However, while the Lakers moving away from Redick is a shock, it may not indicate that James is bound to leave.\n\nLakers making shocking pivot to Dan Hurley in head coach search\n\nHurley becoming the Lakers' head coach may actually implore James to stay with the Lakers. Wojnarowski wrote in his report that having Hurley implement his systems in LA and having his developmental talents for James' son, Bronny, makes for an intriguing situation. James still hopes to play with his son and, while Hurley's player development would obviously extend to others on the team, he would seemingly be very happy to have such a great coach help his son improve.\n\nA tweet from James from this past April showed his admiration for Hurley. In response to a video clip of Redick and Hurley talking on The Old Man and the Three, James replied that Hurley and his UConn staff have been \"super creative\" with their offense.\n\nThe Lakers going with a coach that actually has experience coaching makes sense, even if it has all come at the collegiate and high-school levels. With Redick calling the NBA Finals, he has plenty to focus on right now and keep him busy should he not make the jump to the coaching ranks.\n\nThere's never a dull moment for the Lakers, who are eager to keep winning with James and bounce back from getting stomped out of the playoffs in the first round.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_digiovanni@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Sam DiGiovanni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lakers-Dan-Hurley-LeBron-James.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

He described the Lakers pursuit of Hurley as \"relentless.\"\n\nThe Lakers have had preliminary contact with Hurley and the sides are planning to escalate discussions in the coming days, sources told ESPN. Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said...\n\nLakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka and governor Jeanie Buss are eager to formally discuss with Hurley their vision of marrying his dominant program -- built upon his tactical acumen and his elite player development -- with the storied Lakers brand, sources said.\n\nHurley previously said he was concerned about burnout at the college level, and he might want to test himself in the NBA.\n\nLeBron James praised Hurley is a post on X in April after the Huskie's coach appeared on a podcast (somewhat ironically) with J.J. Redick.\n\nAs for Anthony Davis, Woj writes:\n\nThe Lakers have been committed to making All-NBA forward Anthony Davis a significant part of the conversation on the next head coach and want to make sure he's aligned with how a new coach plans to feature him on offense and defense, sources said.\n\nMore than simply pleasing their stars -- although that is always important in the NBA -- the Lakers reportedly see Hurley as the kind of coach needed in an evolving NBA landscape. With the second apron of the luxury tax looming as almost a defacto hard cap, the ability to develop drafted college players into at least solid NBA role players will be critical for teams looking to maintain success. Teams will be built more like the Denver Nuggets -- two elite stars, quality role players in a good system around them -- than the three-star super teams like the current Phoenix Suns. That means finding good role players and fitting them into a system, and it means developing players. (Teams may go above the second apron for a season to chase a ring, or two tops, but the team-building restrictions once above that line make it impossible to just pay the tax and live with it.)\n\nHurley seems uniquely well-suited to do that.\n\nWhile the buzz in league circles had grown around Redick -- who did meet with the Lakers twice -- the franchise had pushed back against the idea they were close to hiring him. While Redick has an unquestionably high basketball IQ and understands what it takes to grow and develop as a player, the Lakers just had two seasons with a highly respected assistant coach in Darvin Ham, who did not connect with players and succeed at the level the Lakers wanted. To go from Ham to the even more inexperienced Redick -- who has never coached at the high school, college or pro level, even as an assistant -- would have been a huge risk.\n\nHurley is one of the hottest names in coaching and if the Lakers can land him, it's a coup. For Hurley, this would also be a big bump in pay, he reportedly makes a little more than $5 million a year to coach UConn, this new contract likely comes close or will double that figure.\n\nHurley would be walking into one of the most prestigious but one of the most challenging jobs in the NBA -- the expectations from the organization and fans is insanely high even when the talent on the roster does not match those loft hopes. However, if Hurley truly wants to test himself, this is the best place.\n\nThis deal makes sense for both sides, which is a sign it could get done fast.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e35fe02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F812%2F695%2Fnbc_dps_danhurleylakers_v2_240606.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

He was with the team for two seasons and had a winning record each year. However, the Lakers wanted to move forward and Ham was not part of their future. Since he was fired, several candidates have been named. The most intriguing candidate is former NBA player and now analyst, JJ Redick.\n\nThere have been multiple reports this offseason that Redick is the top candidate to replace Darvim Ham. Despite those rumors, we were hit with some breaking news this morning from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. The NBA insider had the scoop that UConn Huskies head coach Danny Hurley is being targeted by the Los Angeles Lakers. Will Hurley leave UConn after winning back-to-back National Championships?\n\nFor the last six seasons, Danny Hurley has been the head coach of the UConn Huskies men's basketball program. He has a 141-58 record and has gone 68-11 over the last two seasons en route to winning back-t0-back National Championships. Hurley had to climb his way through the ranks over his coaching career and has reached the pinnacle of the sport. Has the 51-year-old seen enough in college and is ready for a new challenge? There's a chance according to Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe NBA insider reported that the Lakers are preparing a massive long-term contract for Hurley. He's coached at just about every level in the sport except for the NBA. While the Lakers' head coaching job is one of the most coveted in the NBA, it's hard to see Danny Hurley leaving UConn. The culture and winning DNA that Hurley has established at UConn cannot be replaced with another coach. Hurley is the straw that stirs the drink for the Huskies. Players win games but coaches put their team in a position to do that and Danny Hurley has proved he's one of the best.\n\nJust yesterday, Shams Charania reported that the Lakers were \"zeroing in\" on JJ Redick as their next head coach. Then Adrian Wojnarowski hits us with the Danny Hurley news this morning. Both men have never coached in the NBA. Redick has zero coaching experience at any level and Danny Hurley has been a coach since 2001, starting in high school. A decision will be made by the Lakers sooner than later and they'll have to choose between Danny Hurley and JJ Redick.

Redick, and former Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego. The Lakers reportedly have another big name on their list, and it would send shockwaves through every level of the sport if they can pull it off.\n\nThe Lakers are preparing a big offer to UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley to become the franchise's next head coach, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Hurley is coming off back-to-back national championships with the Huskies in two of the most dominant NCAA tournament runs the sport has ever seen. Hurley, at 51 years old, already has nothing to prove at the college level. Could he be ready to make his own leap to the pros?\n\nLakers star LeBron James praised Hurley recently for his brilliant tactical ability. The Lakers seemed to be on the verge of hiring Redick as their next head coach, but seemingly have to wait until the 2024 NBA Finals are over, because Redick is serving as the ESPN color commentator for the series. Reports of their interest in Hurley throws everything into flux.\n\nThe Lakers and Hurley have had preliminary contact, according to Woj. Hurley is going to hear out the Lakers' pitch in the coming days. The Lakers are reportedly prepping a massive contract offer that would blow his UConn salary out of the water.\n\nHurley's was mentioned as a top candidate for the Kentucky job after John Calipari bolted for Arkansas, but he quickly turned down interest. UConn lost a ton of talent off its 2024 championship team, but Hurley reloaded the roster nicely in the transfer portal and would have a chance to win a third straight national championship.\n\nThe Lakers' job is potentially the mountain top of the sport, but is it really a good job? Here are four reasons Hurley should be careful about what LA has to offer.\n\nThe Lakers have been the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference each of the last two seasons. Yes, the team made a Cinderella run to the Western Conference Finals in 2023, but that ended in a sweep to the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. The Lakers had much better health out of James and Anthony Davis this season, with Davis playing 76 games and James playing 71. The team improved from 43 wins to 47 wins, but it still lost in the first round in a five-game series to the Nuggets.\n\nJames is a free agent this summer, but all indications are that he would prefer to return. D'Angelo Russell is expected to decline his player option and become a free agent coming off a strong season. Otherwise, the Lakers' roster is locked in, and it won't have real cap space to add pieces in free agency. The Lakers could trade up to three first round picks at the time of the draft if they want to swing for another star or better role players.\n\nThe Lakers are pretty good, but they do not have anything close to a championship-level team. They have to show maximum urgency in building one, because ....\n\nJames turns 40 in Dec. He is still one of the 10 best players in the NBA in my estimation, but he's objectively at the twilight of his career. If Hurley takes this job, life without James is coming at him in two or three seasons at the most.\n\nThere's simply no way to replace someone like James. The Cleveland Cavaliers went into the gutter both times after he left. The Miami Heat slipped out of the playoffs and into irrelevancy after James left, too. Even with Davis signed long-term, the Lakers are likely looking at a rebuild post-James, where they will again go hunting for superstars in free agency or the trade market. It won't happen overnight.\n\nIt would be a different story if the Lakers were in the East. In the West, it's hard to see this team breaking through given all the young, ascendant talent in the conference.\n\nNikola Jokic and Luka Doncic are the two best players in the world, and both are firmly in their primes for the Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks respectively. The Oklahoma City Thunder have an MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, two great co-stars, and a million future draft picks. The Timberwolves have Anthony Edwards and the league's top defense. The Grizzlies are going to be a factor next year with the return of Ja Morant.\n\nAnd by the way, Victor Wembanyama's San Antonio Spurs are coming. It's only a matter of time before Wemby is the best player in the world, and the Spurs are competing for championships. Realistically, it's hard to see how the Lakers have a long-term or short-term path to championship contention. However ..\n\nThe NBA is not a patient league. The Phoenix Suns just fired Frank Vogel one year into a five-year contract. The Lakers fired Darvin Ham despite leading the team to an unlikely conference finals bid in 2023. With James still playing at a high level as he turns 40, the expectation will be that Hurley turns the team into a championship contender right away.\n\nThat's going to be extremely different given the state of the Lakers' roster, and given the state of the Western Conference.\n\nYou can make an argument that the Lakers job is the single worst job in the NBA right now. The fanbase wants championships but the roster isn't close to getting there. James holds a ton of power within the organization, which he could flex with his son Bronny James hitting the 2024 NBA Draft. The aftermath of James' eventual retirement could be ugly.\n\nHurley is an absolute psychopath as a competitor. What does he really have to prove in college basketball at this point? He become the first coach to win back-to-back national titles since Billy Donovan at Florida, and he also quickly jumped to the NBA. This era of college basketball is defined by the transfer portal and NIL market, and UConn is never going to pay top dollar in college basketball's free agency. Hurley always wants to win at the highest level, and the NBA is the only challenge left.\n\nI spent a few days around Hurley while covering the 2024 Final Four. What I saw was the most competitive head coach I've ever been around. To go from coaching high school ball in New Jersey a decade ago to coaching the Lakers would be one of the greatest basketball coaching stories ever.\n\nThe Lakers can also play Hurley a lot more money than he'll ever make at UConn. Hurley makes about $3.5 million per year at UConn. He reportedly made $7 million this past season with every bonus triggered. The Lakers are unlikely about to put $100 million guaranteed in front of him. He's going to get triple the money in the NBA that he can make in college.\n\nYes, Hurley is a life-long East Coast guy. His family is comfortable at UConn, and he knows he can win there. But at the end of the day, competitors like Hurley always want the next challenge, and college basketball isn't really a challenge for him anymore.\n\nHow would Hurley's personality play with pros? He's the most intense coach in college basketball, someone who is always on a verge of a total freak out. That might work well with college kids, but will pros really respond to that well? Can he tone it down and still be the same guy?\n\nThe Lakers job is not a good job, but that doesn't mean Hurley won't take it. One thing is for sure: every college basketball program in America outside of Storrs is suddenly a huge Lakers fan. High school, college, and NBA ball would all be massively impacted if Hurley takes the job.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gampel Pavilion. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly trying to hire the hottest head coach in college basketball.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Thursday that the Lakers are preparing a massive long-term contract offer for UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley. The Lakers have targeted Hurley since the start of their head coach search, and the two sides have had preliminary discussions about a deal.\n\nHurley has led UConn to back-to-back national championships and is the most coveted coach in college basketball. He has already turned down one of the most prominent jobs at the collegiate level.\n\nAfter UConn won its second straight national title in April, Hurley said he only wants to coach college basketball in Storrs. He did not rule out coaching in the NBA \"way down the road,\" however.\n\nIf Hurley does want to coach in the NBA, it may be hard for him to turn down arguably the most prestigious job in the league. Wojnarowski reports that the Lakers believe Hurley is the best candidate to navigate the roster-building limitations of the current collective bargaining agreement. L.A.'s brass also feels Hurley can help develop their young core of Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Max Christie.\n\nIt probably helps that LeBron James, who can decline his $51 million player option and become a free agent this summer, has made it clear that he is a big fan of Hurley.\n\nHurley has been the head coach at UConn since 2018. He has an overall record of 141-58 with the Huskies. He was the head coach at Rhode Island for six seasons before taking the UConn job and Wagner for two years before that.\n\nThe landscape of college basketball has changed dramatically in recent years, and Hurley indicated recently that he is exhausted with one aspect of it.

Rhode Island went 113-82 under Hurley, including back-to-back 25-win-plus seasons, winning the 2017 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament and being the 2018 A-10 regular-season champions.\n\nUConn

Recent reports seemed to indicate that JJ Redick was on his way to becoming Ham's replacement, but in a shocking turn of events, it now appears that LA is gunning hard for UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley, and they are rumored to be preparing a massive contract offer for him in an effort to lure him away from the Huskies.\n\nHurley is fresh off leading UConn to two straight NCAA Championships, and while he obviously had some interest from NBA teams looking to bring him to the pros, he generally didn't seem to be in a rush to leave the Huskies. That hasn't stopped the Lakers, though, and they are looking to pull out all the stops to bring Hurley out west.\n\nWhile the Hurley news itself is wildly surprising, there's an added element of shock given how it seemed like Redick was closing in on the job. Now, he could be kicked to the curb in favor of Hurley, despite his strong friendship with LeBron James. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done to get this deal across the finish line, but Redick could find himself on the outside looking in when it comes to LA's head coaching search now.\n\nLakers willing to do whatever it takes to land Dan Hurley\n\nUConn's basketball has been known more for their women's team than their men's team in recent years, but since taking over as the team's head coach back in 2018, Hurley has changed that narrative. The Huskies men's team has become a powerhouse, as they have coasted to victory in the past two March Madness tournaments to establish themselves as the top team in the nation.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the Lakers have such an interest in Hurley. While winning college and winning in the pros are two different things, Hurley has turned the Huskies into a perennial winner. After a pair of rocky seasons with Ham at the helm, Los Angeles wants to find a way to maximize their chances of winning before James eventually calls it a career.\n\nOf course, the first order of business LA has this offseason, regardless of whether or not they hire Hurley, is finding a way to keep James in town. LeBron has a player option in his deal, and should he opt out, he could test the open market in search of a new home. That's obviously not what the Lakers want to happen, so they have to find a way to persuade James to finish his career in Los Angeles.\n\nHiring Hurley, who is one of the top head coaches in the game of basketball right now, would be a great way to prove to James that they are intent on building a winner around him for the final years of his career. There's still a lot of work to be done before any potential deal comes to fruition, but there's clearly some momentum trending in this direction, and the Lakers could very well end up pulling off this massive head coaching hire in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/College and University", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dan-Hurley-gets-100-honest-on-making-NBA-jump-in-future.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Woj later reported on SportsCenter that Hurley has \"shown the willingness\" to listen to the Lakers after the franchise has already had \"preliminary contact\" with Hurley.\n\nAccording to the NBA insider, Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' coaching search all along, even with the organization already interviewing other candidates.\n\nHurley is undoubtedly the most sought-after coach in all of basketball having won back-to-back titles with the Huskies while posting a record of 68-11 over the last two seasons. The only 'mark' on Hurley's resume is that he does not have any coaching experience in the NBA.\n\nThe interesting dynamic in this Hurley to Los Angeles hypothetical is how his coaching style would translate to the professional level. The 51-year-old is among the most-intense coaches in college basketball and brings a more old-school approach to the bench that has escaped much of the sport, especially in the NBA, over recent years.\n\nOutside of making more money, living in Los Angeles, and coaching LeBron James, the Lakers job has to be intriguing to Hurley given that there is no NIL or transfer portal to worry about in the NBA. Instead of working 365 days a year, Hurley would be working fewer days while adding to his bank account.\n\nHe has certainly navigated the choppy NIL waters at the college level extremely well, and even explained that he's coached his UConn players \"harder\" since they began getting paid, but not having to deal with that aspect of the sport while focusing on coaching may be a path Hurley is looking to go down while already at the top of the college coaching world.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/dan-hurley-lakers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Huskies have a noon practice and Hurley told his players it's business as usual for now.\"\n\nThe news of the Lakers going after Hurley comes just a few days after it was reported the Lakers had their eyes set on ESPN analyst and former NBA and Duke guard JJ Redick for the job. On Tuesday, Shams Charania reported that the Lakers were 'zeroing in on' Redick as their next coach.\n\nHurley has been the head coach at UConn for the last six seasons and has taken the program to extraordinary heights. After taking Rhode Island to the second round of the NCAA Tournament twice in six seasons, Hurley moved on to UConn. By just his third season, Hurley had the Huskies back in the NCAA Tournament. Success did not take long to find.\n\nIn his fifth season as head coach, Hurley led a 4-seed Huskies team all the way to the national championship. Despite the pressure of repeating in 2023-24, UConn did just that, looking rather dominant in every game it played along the way to its second straight national championship.\n\nIn six seasons with the Huskies, Hurley has a record of 141-58. He is 292-163 overall in his college coaching career. To go along with that record, Hurley has reached the NCAA Tournament a grand total of six times, holding a 14-4 record in it. Hurley was the national Coach of the Year in 2024, the Big East Coach of the Year in 2024 and the A-10 Coach of the Year in 2018.\n\nIf the money and contract is right, Hurley would be crazy to not take the Lakers' gig, according to UConn women's coach Geno Auriemma.\n\n\"If Danny were to leave, and somebody said to me, you know, he just took this NBA job,\" Auriemma said on the Dan Patrick Show. \"I won't name any particular city, I would say, you know, you're set up for failure. But it's the Lakers and I don't know the details of it, but if you're saying hey, I want a 10 year deal. I want the same deal Brad Stevens got at Boston ... Then you know what?

He is well-known for his mastery of X's and O's and fiery competitive attitude, both of which caught Lakers superstar LeBron James' attention after UConn's title run.\n\nIronically enough, James made his lone public comment praising Hurley in a response to the championship coach's appearance on ... Redick's \"Old Man and the Three\" podcast.\n\nJames and Hurley don't have a documented relationship but the Lakers star did give his stamp of approval on the UConn head coach back in April.\n\nTwo weeks after the Huskies won the 2024 national championship, Hurley appeared on Redick's \"Old Man and the Three\" podcast. The head coach did an in-depth breakdown of UConn's famously complex offensive schemes, crediting San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan for his inspiration.\n\nRedick quoted a viral snippet of his discussion with Hurley, writing, \"Loved this part of our convo with Dan Hurley.\"\n\nJames replied to Redick, complimenting Hurley's creativity with his offensive sets.\n\nJames' comment was originally passed over but it has, of course, resurfaced with the latest news that Hurley could potentially be his next head coach. The tweet now has over one million views.\n\nHurley has been an NCAA Division-I head coach for 14 years. His career started at Wagner in 2010, then he spent six seasons at the University of Rhode Island from 2012-2017.\n\nAfter turning URI into an NCAA Tournament team in consecutive seasons in 2017 and 2018, Hurley was hired to bring UConn back to national championship contention.\n\nSix years later, Hurley led the Huskies to back-to-back national championships -- the first program to do so since Florida in 2006 and 2007.\n\nTake a look at Hurley's success at UConn over the last six seasons.\n\nMORE: How Dan Hurley's potential Lakers deal compares to 2024 UConn salary\n\nRegardless of who the Lakers hire, James is set to play for his 10th head coach in the NBA.\n\nYou can find all nine of his previous head coaches below, and read more about each of their tenures here.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Seahawks_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wagner Seahawks men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rhode_Island", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Rhode Island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/nba-canada--34e1bcee-b409-4570-9e7b-bec145173ebf.jpeg?itok=RG-gJCeo", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Redick, who is set to call the NBA Finals beginning on Thursday, recently side-stepped the topic by indicating saying it \"will be addressed once the season's over,\" and that only added fuel to the fire. With that said, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski delivered a curve ball in the early hours of Thursday morning, reporting that the Lakers are set to present a \"massive, long-term contract offer\" to UConn head coach Dan Hurley.\n\nIn his piece for ESPN, Wojnarowski notes that \"the Lakers have had preliminary contact with Hurley and the sides are planning to escalate discussions in the coming days.\" Hurley was also reportedly the apple of Kentucky's eye during their 2024 coaching search, though Hurley quickly made it clear that was not in his plans.\n\nHurley is the architect of the two-time reigning national champions of men's college basketball, and he is renowned for his tactical abilities at the college level. Though the college-to-pro jump has been less in vogue in recent years, Hurley is highly respected and, as ESPN writes, \"LeBron James has been impressed with Hurley's sophisticated offensive actions.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen as to whether Hurley will sign on the dotted line. For one, the presence of a high-profile, high-dollar offer is appetizing, but nowhere in the reporting is it stated that he is likely to join the Lakers and it would be a substantial risk for him to leave the incredible situation he constructed at UConn for (far) less job security at the NBA level. However, it would also be fair to suggest that the chance to coach the Lakers, and presumably LeBron James, would present a different calculus than a more run-of-the-mill NBA opportunity.\n\nThe Lakers have certainly been interviewing other candidates, ranging from Redick to Sam Cassell and James Borrego, and one of the reasons for the building assumption of Redick as the leader is the reality of his ESPN's commitment and the length of this coaching search. However, Hurley as a leading candidate is the kind of high-profile factor that complicates matters in considerable fashion, and the next steps on all sides will be incredibly interesting.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_rowland@uproxx.com", "name": "Brad Rowland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cassell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dh2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Hurley has won back-to-back national championships with the Huskies and he made it very clear when the offseason started that he wanted to stay at UConn. Now, it's looking like there is a chance that he goes in a different direction.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley as the franchise's next coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer to bring the back-to-back NCAA national champion to the NBA, sources told ESPN,\" The report from Adrian Wojnarowski said. \"The Lakers have had preliminary contact with Hurley and the sides are planning to escalate discussions in the coming days, sources told ESPN. Hurley has been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing several other candidates, sources said.\"\n\nThis is a major twist in the head coaching search because on Wednesday, The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that the Lakers are 'zeroing in on' JJ Redick to become the next head coach in Los Angeles. Redick's name is the one that has been talked about the most during this search, but now that is starting to change.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers are zeroing in on JJ Redick as the front-runner to be the franchise's next head coach, league and media industry sources told The Athletic,\" The report from Shams Charania said.\n\nThis move by Dan Hurley would look familiar\n\nDan Hurley has won the last two national championships with UConn basketball, and now he might be leaving the school to go to the NBA. Sounds familiar, right? That's because former Michigan football head coach Jim Harbaugh just left the Wolverines right after the winning the national championship, and he is now coaching a professional team in Los Angeles. Harbaugh is the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, and Hurley could be the coach of the Lakers soon.\n\nA lot of people are making this comparison, and a lot of people think that it says a lot about the current state of college sports.\n\n\"Jim Harbaugh and Danny Hurley -- fresh off national titles -- jetting to the pros within months of each other is a sad commentary on the state of college athletics,\" Paul Hembekides said in a tweet.\n\nCollege sports has already lost two great coaches this offseason, and Hurley could be the third.\n\n\"Losing Saban, Harbaugh and Hurley from college sports so far in 2024 is a real bummer,\" Brandon Zimmerman said in a tweet. \"I was very interested to watch Hurley go for the first 3-peat since John Wooden next season.\"\n\nOther people don't think that this comparison isn't fair as Jim Harbaugh had flirted with the NFL a ton before this season and clearly wanted to go back to try to get a Super Bowl. Also, this is a pretty attractive offer for Hurley.\n\n\"Harbaugh, an NFL guy at his core, did what he set out to do at Michigan and it's not like Hurley is jumping for the Charlotte Hornets job or something,\" Derek Schulz said in a tweet. \"Don't think either decision is an indictment on college sports whatsoever.\"\n\nNo matter what happens, this is a twist that not a lot of people saw coming. It seemed like Dan Hurley was firmly set on staying with the UConn basketball team for a long time, but now it's looking like he could be heading to Los Angeles.

Reports were coming out daily about Redick being the frontrunner to land the highly coveted job in Los Angeles, but now that no longer seems to be the case.\n\nOn Thursday morning, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski dropped a bombshell on social media that no one saw coming. The NBA insider broke the news that the Lakers are aggressively pursuing UConn's Dan Hurley to be the team's new head coach, with Los Angeles ready to give him a massive, long-term deal.\n\nThis report completely contradicts what Shams Charania of The Athletic reported a day earlier, basically saying that it was Redick's job to lose and that he would more than likely become the new head coach of the Lakers after the NBA Finals concluded later this month.\n\nIronically enough, Lakers superstar LeBron James and Redick talked about Hurley's coaching style and how he's a brilliant mind offensively, which led to back-to-back National Championships won with the Huskies.\n\nClearly, James is quite fond of Hurley and his coaching style, which likely bodes well for him giving his stamp of approval for this hiring if the Lakers are looking for that from the four-time NBA champion.\n\nThe real question moving forward is whether the Lakers brass can get Hurley to sign on the dotted line and how long that process might take. Also, there's the Anthony Davis factor and whether he's on board with the potential new head coach, as it has been said repeatedly that he will be part of the process of hiring Ham's replacement.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future holds for the Lakers as they continue to pursue Hurley and if the team can get him signed and move on to what they'd like to do in the upcoming NBA Draft and NBA free agency that follows.\n\nUConn's Dan Hurley was Lakers' primary target all along\n\nAfter months of speculation regarding the vacant coaching position in Los Angeles, it turns out that Dan Hurley was their primary target all along.\n\nHurley is coming off winning back-to-back titles for the Huskies, which makes him an intriguing candidate, especially considering the other candidates linked to the Lakers job as of late.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_ward@lakersnation.com", "name": "Ryan Ward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_22980628-e1717685694661.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

In the last few weeks, JJ Redick was the frontrunner for the job in the majority's opinion. However, there has been a recent surge in pushing Dan Hurley's name for the job and he is believed to be the final choice of the franchise. Amidst the new buzz, an old tweet from LeBron James has resurfaced where the 39-year-old gave a shoutout to the UConn legend.\n\nHurley joined UConn in 2018, and after setting up his program in the next few years, he started to show results. The 51-year-old took his team to back-to-back NCAA Division I Tournament wins in 2023 and 2024.\n\nSo, it's understandable why all eyes have been on him lately. In April, King James expressed his appreciation for the coach and his staff on X. LeBron wrote,\n\n\"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nNow Hurley's name is being pushed for the Lakers HC position. Considering the respect LeBron has for Hurley, even if his friend Redick doesn't get the job, he will be happy with the new recruit.\n\nA recent report from Adrian Wojnarowski for Sports Center suggests that it's highly likely now that Hurley will be the one to take charge in LA. He said, \"The Los Angeles Lakers are preparing a massive, long-term offer for the Connecticut Huskies coach Dan Hurley to become the next Lakers coach.\"\n\nWoj stated that his name didn't just appear out of thin air as he has been in consideration for the job for a while. Maybe, the Redick-LeBron narrative took the limelight away from him. On top of that, Wojnarowski said that Hurley has been looking forward to an offer from the NBA as it's his dream job.\n\nNow with the Lakers showing immense interest in him, the 51-year-old might just get to live his dream. The analyst said, \"Dan Hurley has shown willingness to listen to the Lakers, Rob Pelinka, their GM and Jeanie Buss, their owner to hear them out and what a Hurley-Lakers partnership would look like.\"\n\nIf the negotiations go through and Hurley takes up the HC position in LA, that will be a major boost for both parties. The UConn coach has been on a winning streak that will mentally benefit the Lakers and for him to get his major break in LA will be a great launching pad for the NBA coaching career.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/ada31bd6-untitled-design-2024-06-06t201010.212.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Los Angeles has reportedly been in contact with Hurley already, with discussions expected to \"escalate\" in the next few days as he's been at the \"forefront\" of the team's head-coach search from the start.\n\nHurley, 51, has helped UConn return to prominence in college basketball in recent years, leading the Huskies to back-to-back championships over the last two seasons. He's gone 141-58 at UConn and 292-163 in his career as a college head coach with previous stops at Wagner and Rhode Island.\n\nWhile Hurley has never coached in the NBA before, Lakers owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka are \"eager\" to discuss their vision for what the head coach can do at the professional level, according to ESPN. Hurley has also \"expressed\" to Los Angeles an interest in coaching the franchise as he has ambitions to coach in the NBA, ESPN added in its report.\n\nThursday's news is a bit of a curveball compared to what's been reported over the last few weeks. The Lakers were zeroing in on J.J. Redick to become their next coach, The Athletic reported Tuesday. As there was some belief that Redick would replace Darvin Ham, the other candidates who had reportedly interviewed for the job were NBA assistant coaches and former head coaches (Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell and former Charlotte Hornets head coach James Borrego being the most notable).\n\nLakers star LeBron James' connection to Redick also played a role in the belief that the former player turned broadcaster was the favorite to get the job. The two began hosting a podcast together, \"Mind the Game,\" in March, discussing hot topics in basketball and the nuances of the sport.\n\nShortly after Thursday's news broke though, a social media post of James praising Hurley resurfaced, indicating that he's a fan of the UConn coach.\n\n\"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff,\" James wrote in a social media post in April about Hurley following UConn's second straight national title. \"Super creative with their O! Love it\"\n\nMeanwhile, Redick said Wednesday that his focus was on the NBA Finals and that he would address his candidacy for the Lakers' job at a later time. Redick is calling the final round of the playoffs for ABC.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wagner College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cassell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1408/814/Dan-Hurley-H.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

After all, LeBron co-hosts a basketball podcast with Redick and the two have great chemistry together on the show.\n\nTo be clear, that isn't to suggest that LeBron isn't a fan of Hurley or what he has accomplished at UConn. In fact, the NBA's all-time leading scorer posted a reply to a recent podcast appearance featuring Hurley with very high praise.\n\nThe host of that podcast was none other than Redick, who may assumed was previously the frontrunner to take over as head coach of the Lakers before the recent report about Hurley surfaced.\n\nLeBron is clearly impressed by Hurley and after two consecutive collegiate national championships, it is easy to see why.\n\nBut for all of his accolades and accomplishments that he has earned thus far, what he is most celebrated for is his ability to get the most out of young players. Even in ESPN's initial report, Hurley's \"elite player development\" is unsurprisingly one of the first traits mentioned.\n\nThat matters significantly, per Wojnarowski, and could mean a lot to the future of LeBron's son Bronny:\n\n\"Assuming James returns to L.A. in free agency, the possibility of using the 55th pick in this month's NBA draft on USC freshman guard Bronny James makes Hurley an even more intriguing candidate. If that happens, James gets a chance to play with his son and the benefit of Hurley and his staff becoming responsible for Bronny's pro development.\"\n\nWojnarowski continued that thought during an appearance on ESPN's UNSPORTSMANLIKE Radio.\n\nHere is more from Woj:\n\n\"You're gonna have to grow your young players and the idea of Bronny James and the Lakers: They have the 55th pick. Who better potentially than Dan Hurley to be the development coach to lead his growth than the coach who has really dominated the college sport?\"\n\nFor what it is worth, though, Bronny (a former McDonald's All-American) did not receive an offer from Hurley and UConn when he was coming out of high school.\n\nBut of course, it isn't just Bronny (who isn't even on the Lakers roster at this point) that Los Angeles is considering when targeting Hurley.\n\nWojnarowski added:\n\n\"This is a decision and an idea for beyond LeBron James. I think Anthony Davis is at the forefront of this conversation ... He wants to have a voice in this. He wants to be on the same page with this new head coach, whoever it is, and see how that new coach may use him, the actions he can put him in.\"\n\nOverall, the messaging is that this hire is not about a 39-year-old LeBron and more about the rest of the roster.\n\nHere are some thoughts from ESPN's Brian Windhorst:\n\n\"LeBron told the Lakers they need to make a decision on their head coach that's not just about me, it's not just about what's good for me for this year, next year ... It's going to be about what you need to do for your franchise. It's going to be about Anthony Davis. That is what he said ... He wants the Lakers to do what's best for their team long-term. If the Lakers make a hire like this, it's not for LeBron.\"\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here but the reality is that Hurley has most of his experience coaching players like Bronny, who have the potential to improve but aren't where they want to be as basketball players quite yet.\n\nDoes that mean he is incapable of coaching stars like LeBron and Davis?\n\nWe have seen him have tremendous success in the NCAA using NBA-style schemes and systems, so it could potentially translate.\n\nWhen you watch Hurley coach, you can see why his message resonates well with players Bronny's age and may not have that same impact on NBA vets. All things considered, this coach seems to make the most sense for a younger roster where the Lakers are a team loaded with experienced pros.\n\nNBA Finals Game 1 odds and predictions: Luka Doncic on

The Lakers are expected to have deeper discussions \"in the coming days\" to persuade Hurley to leave UConn, where he has won consecutive national championships.\n\nWojnarowski adds Hurley and the Lakers have held preliminary talks, and the UConn coach has been the No. 1 target as the team has met with others, such as former NBA player J.J. Redick and former Charlotte Hornets head coach James Borrego.\n\nLos Angeles fired second-year head coach Darvin Ham after a first-round playoff exit this year.\n\nSince the final buzzer sounded with the Huskies winning the championship in April, Hurley, 51, has been adamant about returning and staying at UConn for the longhaul.\n\nWhile the Huskies lost center Donovan Clingan and guard Stephon Castle, who are likely lottery picks in the draft, Hurley saw Alex Karaban pull out of the draft and then landed Saint Mary's transfer Aidan Mahaney. All-in-all, they are viewed as a top-10 team.\n\nUConn had so far survived keeping Hurley despite overtures from the likes of Kentucky, which was seeking to replace John Calipari after his move to Arkansas.\n\n\"My answer to that (Kentucky interest) was 'no.' I'm the head coach at the best program in the country,\" Hurley told The Dan Patrick Show in April. \"Why would I leave the best program in the country even if another place is really good or great? But your agent wants you to try to deflect.\n\n\"You want to reward your staff, you want to increase the resources in your program. So your agent is kind of telling you: 'Don't say you're interested but don't say no because I've got to deal with the UConn people.'\"\n\nHurley and UConn are currently in extension negotiations that Hurley addressed on Wednesday night.\n\nLike his brother Bobby, Dan Hurley had leaned into the changing ways of college basketball despite complaints -- which have been filtered through his humor -- about the transfer portal and NIL.\n\nBut in the NBA, Hurley would bring immediate credibility because of his offensive sets that play to the pace of the NBA. His UConn team also competed on the defensive end, and the combination of all those things saw UConn's closest deficit during a six-game tournament run end up as a 14-point win over Alabama in the Final Four.\n\nUConn's execution and complexities of their offense drew eyes from NBA perspectives, most notably from Redick and his current podcast partner, Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nLos Angeles has approached their search with an emphasis on building beyond the James era, and Hurley's potential development of players like Austin Reaves and Max Christie is being considered here.\n\nThe question would be whether Hurley's brash, in-your-face style will be subdued while working with older players and NBA stars.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats & Info, UConn was third in Division I basketball with 25 technical fouls since Hurley arrived there in 2018-19. To paint the picture of his fire, Hurley was shoving his own player while stepping on the court in the final three minutes of the national championship game when his team led by 15 points in April.\n\nHurley, whose father Bob Hurley Sr. is a Hall of Fame High School coach in New Jersey, got his start as an assistant at Rutgers from 1997-2001.\n\nHe coached the next decade at St. Benedict's prep before jumping into college as head coach at Wagner (2010-12) and Rhode Island (2012-18). Bobby Hurley coached as an assistant to Dan at both schools until he took the Buffalo head-coaching job from 2013-15. Bobby Hurley left for the Arizona State job in 2015.\n\nIf Hurley does take the Lakers job, it's not wild to assume the fallout could impact the teams in Arizona, in some fashion.\n\nUConn's talented returning roster would be at risk of dissolving.\n\nArizona State Sun Devil fans could hope Hurley sends some players his brother's way. You could look at Mahaney, who is from Campolindo High School in California, as a dream candidate and floor general for a rebuilt Sun Devil squad.\n\nArizona Wildcat fans are coming from the Jedd Fisch-to-Washington trauma that began with a college coaching legend, Nick Saban, stepping away on the football side. They might hope their head basketball coach Tommy Lloyd, isn't viewed as a candidate to replace Hurley out East. That would be viewed as a longshot since Lloyd is from the Pacific Northwest and doesn't have the postseason resume to wow UConn boosters.\n\nBut some former Arizona coaches might be the new faces of UConn.\n\nCurrent Huskies assistant Luke Murray, the son of Bill Murray, could be viewed as a legitimate in-house replacement option. He was a graduate assistant under Sean Miller at Arizona from 2009-10 and worked with both Hurleys at Wagner in 2010-11.\n\nMiller's name might be floated, too, though he's coming off a 16-18 season, the second year of his second stint at Xavier.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_zimmerman@arizonasports.com", "name":

Sure, he's fair game.\n\nPer Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Lakers are set to make a large and lengthy offer to Hurley to become their next coach. So much for the J.J. Redick rumors.\n\nInterestingly, it's been 20 years to the summer since the Lakers tried to pry away Mike Krzyzewski from Duke University. Krzyzewski said thanks but no thanks, and according to Hoops Wire, Hurley is likely to say the same.\n\n\"No one is really saying as much, but the Lakers job could be thankless,\" one source told the outlet. \"Dan has a good thing going right where he is.\"\n\nCollege coaches tend not to work out in the NBA, though it went OK for former Butler coach Brad Stevens, who went to the Boston Celtics, before eventually becoming their head of basketball operations. But Butler wasn't UConn -- as Hurley could potentially become one of college basketball's all-time coaching legends. The Huskies are two-time defending champs.\n\nYou want to leave that to go deal with an aging LeBron James, an injury-prone Anthony Davis and a Lakers organization that fires its coaches every two years? James has been in Los Angeles since 2018.

Dan Hurley has an excruciating choice, the greater of two blessings", "body": "Chances are good that Dan Hurley is spending Thursday in the space he reserves for deep contemplation, for the news that exploded before rush hour has left the idol of Connecticut with a decision to make, whether to retain the idyllic life he has created here, or reach for even higher ground.\n\n\"I want him to stay because that's good for UConn,\" was Jim Calhoun's succinct way of putting it. \"But he can't lose either way.\"\n\nThe Lakers, Adrian Wojnarowski first reported for ESPN, are preparing to make a \"massive offer\" to hire Hurley, and sources everywhere confirm the interest is real, even if it is a little unusual for them to decide six weeks into their search to go all out for the hottest name in the game. That's what they've decided to do.\n\nReport: Los Angeles Lakers targeting UConn's Dan Hurley with 'massive contract offer'\n\nAnd it would be very unusual for Hurley, after spurning Kentucky right after winning a second straight title, to go through two months of recruiting, counseling players about staying or coming back to UConn, and making public appearances like the two he made this week, to now decide he would consider moving on. Especially when he has said he's \"not ready\" for the NBA and would need to \"mature as a coach\" before making such a move.\n\nBut that is where we are, because who knows what a massive offer is? Could be $100 million for five years, and that might be enough for any coach to get ready in a hurry. UConn can't outbid the Lakers.\n\nWhen one must choose between the lesser of two evil options, that is excruciating. When must choose between the greater of two blessings, between outrageous money at UConn and generational money in Los Angeles, it can be just as hard, but in a different way. To be great, one must be willing to leave their comfort zone, and that means risking happiness. We should all have such a choice, but that doesn't make it a no-brainer, especially for a guy who shifts his brain into overdrive like Dan Hurley.\n\nForgive the rambling course this is about to take, because Hurley is a complicated and all-over-the-map type. But I'll get to the nub here: I am guessing, as I write at noon, he will stay at UConn, with the pot of gold sweetened by this this episode.\n\nI just wouldn't bet the ranch or his chickens on it.\n\nHurley mentioned in 2019, long before he won at UConn, that coaching in the NBA on his mind. I got some heat for writing it, in fact.\n\n\"That would be my goal,\" Hurley said at a Coaches Road Show stop at Dunkin' Park. \"I would love to win a couple of championships, get UConn back on top of the mountain. I think in the long term, you have to have goals. You have to have things you continue to drive and reach for. I want to be a championship-level coach here and someday, down the road, the NBA is something I'd think about.\"\n\nDan Hurley: 'We've spoiled ourselves,' but UConn men are back to the grind\n\nFive years later, UConn is on top of the mountain and Hurley is on top of the world. He signed a new deal worth $31.5 million last June, and garnered close to $7 million this past season in leading the Huskies to the repeat. Kentucky might have doubled that, but Hurley shut them down early and made clear he never wanted to coach at \"any other college.\"\n\n'The only people you should be talking to is UConn because we have no desire to leave here to coach college basketball anywhere else,'\" Hurley said he told his agent.\n\nAs for the NBA, Hurley said that day, following the parade in Hartford, \"Maybe down the road, you hope you can mature enough emotionally to, much later in my career, try to take a shot at the NBA - down the road, way down the road.\"\n\nHurley appeared Tuesday at the Franciscan Sports Banquet and made clear he was all in, and confident on going for a three-peat. On Wednesday, he appeared at the last of the Coaches Road Shows and again re-affirmed it. But talks for a new contract at UConn are not done, and Hurley told reporters afterward things were \"complicated,\" that he's \"not a businessman.\"\n\nI suggested that the commitment of years might be paramount, but Hurley, 51, then said he didn't plan to coach into his 60s, that by then, he might want to finish his career as a high school coach, where he began, at a place like St. Benedict's in Newark. He and his wife, Andrea, are East Coast folks.\n\nSo there is no telling exactly where he is with this process. Maybe, having surrendered leverage by spurning Kentucky, Hurley and his agent are trying to get UConn president Radenka Maric, who has a responsibility to keep the budget under control, to move the needle and close the deal?\n\nWhen moderator Mike Crispino asked the panel, \"if you could be another coach, who would you be?\" Hurley did not say Phil Jackson or Pat Riley, he named Geno Auriemma, who was shaking his head.\n\nAuriemma actually joked with Hurley about the Lakers job, but later said he didn't know what was going on. If Hurley goes to Hollywood before this week is out, there should be an Oscar waiting for him.\n\nWhat we do know, too, is that coaching anywhere in the NBA, a \"players league,\" is very different from college, where coaches are the rock stars. Calhoun passed up a couple of chances because he knew who he was, that coaching a pro team where the top stars run the show might not be the best fit for him. Hurley undoubtedly knows this, too.\n\nDan Hurley commits to UConn's future, starts construction of 2024-25 roster as he hunts 'three-peat'\n\nAnd coaching the Lakers in 2024 may be the most complicated job in NBA history. LeBron James, 39, one of the two or three greatest players ever, is the franchise. He's won titles in Cleveland, Miami and LA, but his relationships with coaches have created short shelf lives. Now, his son, Bronny, is in the NBA Draft, but not considered a sure-fire prospect. It's assumed that LeBron wants his son on the Lakers.\n\nJames had glowing things to say about UConn's sophisticated offense during the Final Four, and the idea of having Hurley on board to develop his son might be appealing, and I'm not criticizing any of this here.\n\nBut this will be a delicate task, will take political skill and probably a lot of compromise. Are these are conditions for Dan Hurley, a guy who often derides \"helicopter parents,\" to thrive?\n\nOther side of the coin? James won't be playing much longer, and if Hurley can win enough to stay in the job and outlast him, he could eventually have a free hand. And if Hurley has guaranteed, generational money and it doesn't work out in the NBA, he could have his pick of college jobs, like Rick Pitino and John Calipari once did.\n\nSo here we find Dan Hurley on the top of the basketball world, if not the world at-large, deciding whether to stay put and not mess with happy, or shoot for the moon and fall among the stars if he fails. And who is to say, if things go south at UConn when and if a revenue sharing system is implemented, that an NBA opportunity will knock again?\n\nIt's quite a choice, potentially life-changing for the next several generations of Hurleys. My guess, and UConn's hope, is he stays, but we're not the ones with $100 million or so dangling before our eyes.

They are targeting UConn's Dan Hurley as their next head coach per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, preparing a massive long-term contract offer for the back-to-back NCAA national champion.\n\nAll signs have pointed to the job being essentially JJ Redick's, so Thursday's early morning news came as a surprise. But it makes sense given Hurley's impeccable coaching resume.\n\nThat interest had been brewing all along, according to Wojnarowski. Hurley had \"been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process\" due to the Lakers' desire to combine \"his tactical acumen and elite player development -- with the storied Lakers' brand.\"\n\nHere's why Hurley is such an intriguing option for the Lakers.\n\nMORE: Why UConn's Dan Hurley is Sporting News' College Basketball Coach of the Year\n\nThere are few that would be more qualified for this job than Hurley. He's the first men's college coach to win back-to-back national championships since Billy Donovan did it with Florida in 2007. Hurley's 141-58 career record in college is impressive on its face, as is his NCAA tournament record of 12 consecutive double-digit wins.\n\nUConn dominated this past season, going 37-3 and rolling through the NCAA tournament. That came in large part due to Hurley's strategies. No other coach incorporates as much movement into their offenses. His sets are complicated and more precise than a Swiss watch, leading to great shots for his team.\n\nThat play style has caught the eye of LeBron, who \"has been impressed with Hurley's sophisticated offensive actions,\" according to Wojnarowski.\n\nHurley has also developed his players well. Donovan Clingan and Stephon Castle are widely considered to be lottery picks in this upcoming draft. That could be another benefit for LeBron if the team decides to take Bronny with their no. 55 pick in the draft.\n\nHurley has coaching in his blood. His father was a legendary high school coach in New Jersey, winning 26 state championships. His brother was a two-time national champion with Duke and coaches at Arizona State. He was born for this job.\n\nMORE: Get to know famous Hurley coaching brothers\n\nThere are some potential issues that Hurley could encounter if he does decide to accept the Lakers' offer.\n\nFirst among them is building a relationship with LeBron James. He's not an easy star to coach. Being a great tactician is not enough -- he once tried to get Eric Spoelstra fired. Hurley with be the 10th coach of James' career.\n\nHurley's personality will also be an interesting litmus test on what does and doesn't work in the NBA. It has increasingly become a players' league, far different from the college ranks where coaches have more authority. Will that pose a challenge for Hurley, who has never been afraid of expressing his both positive and negative emotions?\n\n\"I'm a crier,\" Hurley recently told FOX Sports. \"I laugh, I yell and I cry. Jim Valvano said that's a full day.\n\nRedick was an attractive option for much different reasons. Knowing how to pace players throughout a much more grueling season is one of the biggest and least appreciated aspects of the job. Other college coaches have failed in that regard, most recently evidenced by John Beilein's short and disastrous tenure with the Cavs.\n\nRedick's 15 years of NBA experience would have given him a huge advantage. His already built-in relationship with James was another checkmark for him.\n\nHurley is the more proven tactician and winner. He has a history of player development that completely outclasses Redick's. You don't know what will happen when you sit in that front seat, which the Lakers saw first-hand with long-time assistant Darvin Ham. Hurley is a much lower risk for the team.\n\nThe next big question is if Hurley will even want the job. He has a great setup at UConn after signing a six year, $31.5 million extension last summer.\n\nThe interest in Hurley is coming at the perfect time for him. Coaching salaries are growing massively ever since the Pistons broke the bank with a six year, $78.5 million deal. Hurley could more than double his salary with a move to the NBA.\n\nMORE: Who are the highest-paid coaches in the NBA?\n\nHurley is going to earn that money, because the Lakers job might be one of the toughest in the league.

He said it had to be a job \"where an organization wants a tone setter to come in and instill a culture. You know, young players and an organization that wants to pursue championships.\"\n\nThose comments took on newfound meaning early Thursday when ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski dropped a bombshell story with the potential significant implications at both the NBA and college level. The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting Hurley as the franchise's next head coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer, Wojnarowski reported.\n\nIt doesn't take a basketball savant to see why Hurley would be intrigued by the opportunity to coach the Lakers. This is maybe the premier job in basketball. It's a chance to guide a franchise that has captured 17 NBA championships, that has landed high-profile free agent after high-profile free agent and that has never hesitated to pay big-name coaches top dollar.\n\nPhil Jackson earned an annual salary of $12 million near the end of his Lakers tenure that ended 13 years ago. Would it surprise anyone if the Lakers' offer to Hurley surpassed that?\n\nIt also helps that Hurley appears to have the approval of the most powerful man in the Lakers organization. In April, responding to an interview that JJ Redick did with Hurley for his podcast, LeBron James wrote on X: \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nThen there's the matter of how much more taxing and exhausting it is to be a college basketball coach today than it was even five years ago. Between the transfer portal and players gaining the potential to receive NIL money, recruiting is more intense and more round-the-clock. This past March, coaches whose teams were in the NCAA tournament were simultaneously raising NIL money, scouting and pursuing transfers and re-recruiting their own players.\n\nHurley himself joked about that on the eve of UConn's national title game showdown against Purdue two months ago. Asked about his biggest motivation during the NCAA tournament, a smiling Hurley quipped, \"I just don't want to deal with the portal s -- . That's why we're trying so hard to win right now.\"\n\n\"I'm seeing what other people are doing, and it's chaos,\" he added. \"I can hide behind, 'Hey, my season's still going on.'\"\n\nThose are all good reasons for Hurley to be tempted by the Lakers job -- but not necessarily for him to take it. He'd be risking a lot going to the Lakers and giving up even more if he leaves a UConn program that he himself has described as a perfect fit.\n\nHistory is littered with successful college basketball coaches who took a shot at leaping to the NBA but failed spectacularly.\n\nIn 1996, the New Jersey Nets hired John Calipari away from UMass on the heels of a Final Four run. The young, brash Calipari lasted only two-plus seasons with the Nets after rubbing veteran players and the New York media the wrong way on more than one occasion.\n\nIn 1997, the Boston Celtics plucked Rick Pitino from Kentucky after he won the 1996 national title and fell one win short of going back-to-back the following year. The result was a 102-146 record and the infamous \"Larry Bird is not walking through that door\" rant.\n\nJerry Tarkanian, Tim Floyd, Fred Hoiberg and Mike Montgomery had similar results. John Beilein somehow fared even worse. Only Billy Donovan and Brad Stevens achieved sustained success at the NBA level -- and even Donovan hasn't won a playoff series since his debut season in Oklahoma City nearly a decade ago.\n\nThe 51-year-old Hurley undeniably has the coaching acumen to thrive in the NBA and the authenticity and fiery demeanor to hold players accountable, but there's also no denying that he's quirky and that his temper burns hot. This is a guy whose practices are legendarily grueling; who searches for the slightest perceived slight to use as motivation; who rants and raves at referees after every close call.\n\nOn the sideline at UConn practices last fall were a set of cardboard posters representing every trophy that the Huskies could win during the upcoming season. Those posters took a beating from Hurley kicking them down or firing projectiles at them whenever he felt his team didn't practice up to its capabilities.\n\nHurley's hand-picked UConn players fed off his nonstop intensity. Would NBA veterans feel the same over the course of an 82-game schedule?\n\nThe Lakers' track record of burning through seven coaches in 13 years is also a red flag that Hurley shouldn't ignore. Frank Vogel lasted two seasons after winning a championship. Darvin Ham was ousted the year after reaching the Western Conference finals. Who's to say that Hurley wouldn't be scapegoated the first time things go awry?\n\nAt UConn, Hurley has the job security that comes with engineering the greatest two-year run in modern men's college basketball history.\n\nIn 2023, a UConn team led by Jordan Hawkins, Andre Jackson and Adama Sanogo trounced its six NCAA tournament opponents by 20 points per game. Five of that team's top eight players moved on, yet last season's Huskies proved to be even more unbeatable, winning six NCAA tournament games by a record-setting 23.3 points apiece.\n\nThe college game may be tough on coaches these days, but Hurley has thrived better than anyone else amid the chaos. He has found a formula that works for him, sometimes passing on the most talented prospects in favor of team-first freshmen and transfers who prioritize winning and who aren't afraid to be coached hard.\n\nThanks to Hurley, UConn now has a chance to become the first program to three-peat since the heyday of John Wooden's UCLA dynasty in the 1970s. The Huskies are a fixture in way-too-early preseason top fives thanks to the return of standout forward Alex Karaban and the arrival of a bevy of accomplished newcomers.\n\nWhen speaking with Francesa earlier this week, Hurley acknowledged that leaving the northeast in general and UConn in particular would be hard for him. He said he hopes to stay \"as long as we're able to find these old-school folks to bring into our program and then we just blend it with modern basketball.\"\n\n\"If we keep doing it like this,\" added Hurley, \"I'll stay here and the NBA will never be a thing.\"\n\nMaybe Hurley should take his own advice. Maybe he should leverage the Lakers' interest into a big raise and then stay where he is beloved.\n\nCoaching the Lakers is a job you can't pass up, except maybe Dan Hurley should.", "source": {"uri":

When you combine that with the pressure of coaching the Lakers and James, it would be close to an impossible situation for him to enter.\n\nThis isn't to suggest Redick will be a bad coach if he does decide to take that route, but Hurley would make a lot more sense for the Lakers if ends up being the choice.\n\nThe Lakers need a coach who can bridge the gap between the present, assuming James stays with the club either by opting in to his deal for next season or signing a new contract, and long-term future with Anthony Davis as the face of the franchise.\n\nHurley has 14 seasons of experience as a head coach at the college level. He turned around a UConn program that fell out of the ranks of the nation's elite programs in the wake of NCAA violations under former head coach Kevin Ollie.\n\nThe 51-year-old Hurley rebuilt the Huskies into the premier program in the nation with national titles in each of the past two seasons.

Thursday morning, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Lakers are preparing a lucrative, long-term offer for UConn head coach Dan Hurley, and Hurley is now willing to meet with the team.\n\n\"He is the target of their search,\" Wojnarowski said. \"He's been the target for the Lakers search since the beginning. Both sides have had preliminary contact and those conversations are expected to escalate in the coming days.\"\n\nHurley led the UConn Huskies to back-to-back titles after defeating Purdue in the championship game this year, the first repeat since the Florida Gators in 2006-07 and 2007-08. He and his staff have completely revived the program and have now made it a top destination for not only five-star high school recruits but top transfers in the portal. In six seasons at UConn, Hurley is 141-58.\n\n\"We practice 11 months out of the year, and Coach Hurley pushed us to our max every single day,\" projected lottery pick Donovan Clingan told Yahoo Sports last month. \"The coaching staff got everything out of us and put us in the best position possible to be successful and succeed at a high level.\"\n\nCam Spencer, a projected second-round pick in this month's NBA Draft, transferred to UConn from Rutgers for his senior year and didn't hold back when asked why he chose coach Hurley and his program.\n\n\"There's definitely no *ss-kissing in the recruiting process, and that was my favorite part about it,\" Spencer told reporters during a media session at the Final Four. \"They're going to hold you accountable, they're going to tell you the truth about your strengths and weaknesses and where they see you fit in the program. I think that's one of the most special things about UConn, especially nowadays when kids want to hear all the things they're doing well, and the reality is you probably suck and need to get better in a lot of areas. That's the one thing I appreciate about Coach Hurley and our whole staff and just how honest they are with us as players.\"\n\nThe Huskies have a top-10 recruiting class coming in next year led by five-star wing Liam McNeeley and four-stars Isaiah Abraham and Ahmad Nowell. The most notable win was getting Alex Karaban to return for his junior year. The 6-foot-8 wing was one of the best players at the NBA Draft Combine last month, leading all players in the 3-point star drill, finishing 21-of-25. Karaban followed that up with two solid days of scrimmages where he was making good reads offensively and guarding the perimeter well. Many thought he would stay in this draft class with multiple teams interested in him as an early second-round pick, but he announced he would be going back to Storrs for another year right before the withdrawal deadline on May 29.\n\nTo leave with solid talent coming in and one of the team's best players returning for a chance at a three-peat would be extremely hard to walk away from.\n\nHurley has voiced his frustration with the college landscape and how out of control the transfer portal has gotten with over 1,000 players electing to transfer each year since the rule change in 2021. During his media availability prior to the championship game, Hurley was asked about motivation for his team when it has a huge target on its back, and he bluntly, and very honestly, cited the pains of the transfer portal.\n\n\"My biggest motivation for the last two to three weeks is that I don't want to deal with the portal s***,\" Hurley said. \"I can hide behind the fact that my season is still going on.\"\n\nHurley has been the biggest name in college coaching after his historic run at UConn and the way he's not only built championship teams, but also had success developing players for the NBA Draft. This year UConn has two projected lottery picks in Clingan and Stephon Castle, while Spencer and Tristen Newton could be drafted in the second round.\n\nImmediately following John Calipari's departure to Arkansas, Hurley became the top name to take over at Kentucky. He shut down any chance of that happening after the title game telling reporters with a laugh, \"I don't think that's a concern. You know my wife, you should have her answer that.\"\n\nTwo months later and his name is now in the mix for the hottest job in the NBA. The NBA is significantly different than college and especially the Lakers job with LeBron James and all the different personalities and egos in the locker room.\n\nIf Hurley does agree to become the next head coach of the Lakers on a long-term deal, he would be the future for VP and GM Rob Pelinka and governor Jeanie Buss, who would be looking further ahead than just the next two seasons. LeBron has said he doesn't have many years left. His son, Bronny, could be a second-round target for the Lakers in this year's draft. LeBron has said repeatedly that he wants to end his career sharing the court with his son. A rebuild for the Lakers could be two short years away and there's no coach that has been more successful in rebuilding a program and winning at the highest level in college than Hurley and he could very well bring the same success to the Lakers when the time comes.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Allegedly, the Los Angeles Lakers are pursuing UConn head coach, Dan Hurley, for the team's head coaching position. The Huskies head coach rose to fame after he recently led a previously struggling UConn programme to back-to-back national championships, making him one of the most sought-after basketball coaches globally.\n\nWhile the NBA world tries to speculate on the terms of Hurley's deal with the Lakers, former NBA guard Gilbert Arenas took the opportunity to troll his friend and ESPN analyst, JJ Redick, who was the frontrunner for the position before Hurley.\n\nTaking to X, Arenas posted a Jonathan Frakes \"You are wrong\" meme, showing his support for Hurley's appointment while making it clear that fans speculating about Redick's appointment are simply \"wrong\".\n\nNo surprise that Gilbert Arenas isn't backing his friend in his pursuit of becoming an NBA coach, at least not for the Lakers, as he wants them to pick up a legacy coach this time around, and not another rookie. Talking about it further on his show, Gils Arena, the former Washington Wizard said,\n\n\"Why is the Laker job the starting kit for everybody's career? This is supposed to be where we get the Mayweathers today, we dont want Mayweather going 0-0 and 1-0, let's get the great one.\"\n\nThe Lakers will surely have a great coach if they manage to land Hurley during this offseason. While things are still developing by the hour, LeBron James will have until June 29, to decide if he wants to opt into his player option or not, and with his son Bronny James still on the draft board, it will be interesting to see if the signing of Hurley pans out or not.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski was among the first to break the news of Dan Hurley's possibly signing to the Lakers. With a few hours having passed since the news broke, the veteran reporter was back with another crucial piece of information. On ESPN, Woj wrote about the Lakers' situation with Hurley,\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting UConn men's basketball coach Dan Hurley as the franchise's next coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer to bring the back-to-back NCAA national champion to the NBA.\"\n\nWojnarowski further reported that the Lakers have already interviewed a plethora of candidates for the role but have made it clear that Hurley will definitely be the team's front-runner for the position as things stand.\n\nThe two sides will reportedly escalate their discussions and negotiations over the coming days, as the Lakers GM Rob Pelinka and Governor Jeanie Buss are reportedly eager to discuss Hurley's plans for the team.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trikansh_kher@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Trikansh Kher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Arenas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilbert Arenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Frakes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Frakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/ef37a54a-untitled-design-2024-06-06t210331.151.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 1496, "textEnd": 1503}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He said it had to be a job \"where an organization wants a tone setter to come in and instill a culture. You know, young players and an organization that wants to pursue championships.\"\n\nThose comments took on newfound meaning early Thursday when ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski with the potential significant implications at both the NBA and college level. The Los Angeles Lakers are targeting Hurley as the franchise's next head coach and are preparing a massive, long-term contract offer, Wojnarowski reported.\n\nIt doesn't take a basketball savant to see why Hurley would be intrigued by the opportunity to coach the Lakers. This is maybe the premier job in basketball. It's a chance to guide a franchise that has captured 17 NBA championships, that has landed high-profile free agent after high-profile free agent and that has never hesitated to pay big-name coaches top dollar.\n\nPhil Jackson earned an annual salary of $12 million at the end of his Lakers tenure 13 years ago. Would it surprise anyone if the Lakers' offer to Hurley surpassed that?\n\nIt also helps that Hurley appears to have the approval of the most powerful man in the Lakers organization. In April, responding to an interview that JJ Redick did with Hurley for his podcast, LeBron James : \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nThen there's the matter of how much more taxing and exhausting it is to be a college basketball coach today than it was even five years ago. Between the transfer portal and players gaining the potential to receive NIL money, recruiting is more intense and more round-the-clock. This past March, coaches whose teams were in the NCAA tournament were simultaneously raising NIL money, scouting and pursuing transfers and re-recruiting their own players.\n\nHurley himself joked about that on the eve of UConn's national title game showdown against Purdue two months ago. Asked about his biggest motivation during the NCAA tournament, a smiling Hurley quipped, \"I just don't want to deal with the portal s -- . That's why we're trying so hard to win right now.\"\n\n\"I'm seeing what other people are doing, and it's chaos,\" he added. \"I can hide behind, 'Hey, my season's still going on.'\"\n\nThose are all good reasons for Hurley to be tempted by the Lakers job -- but not necessarily for him to take it. He'd be risking a lot going to the Lakers and giving up even more if he leaves a UConn program that he himself has described as a perfect fit.\n\nHistory is littered with successful college basketball coaches who took a shot at leaping to the NBA but failed spectacularly.\n\nIn 1996, the New Jersey Nets hired John Calipari away from UMass on the heels of a Final Four run. The young, brash Calipari lasted only two-plus seasons with the Nets after rubbing veteran players and the New York media the wrong way on more than one occasion.\n\nIn 1997, the Boston Celtics plucked Rick Pitino from Kentucky after he won the 1996 national title and fell one win short of going back-to-back the following year. The result was a 102-146 record and\n\nJerry Tarkanian, Tim Floyd, Fred Hoiberg and Mike Montgomery had similar results. John Beilein somehow fared even worse. Only Billy Donovan and Brad Stevens achieved sustained success at the NBA level -- and even Donovan hasn't won a playoff series since his debut season in Oklahoma City nearly a decade ago.\n\nThe 51-year-old Hurley undeniably has the coaching acumen to thrive in the NBA and the authenticity and fiery demeanor to hold players accountable, but there's also no denying that he's quirky and that his temper burns hot. This is a guy whose practices are legendarily grueling; who searches for the slightest perceived slight to use as motivation; who rants and raves at referees after every close call.\n\nOn the sideline at UConn practices last fall were a set of cardboard posters representing every trophy that the Huskies could win during the upcoming season. Those posters took a beating from Hurley kicking them down or firing projectiles at them whenever he felt his team didn't practice up to its capabilities.\n\nHurley's hand-picked UConn players fed off his nonstop intensity. Would NBA veterans feel the same over the course of an 82-game schedule?\n\nThe Lakers' track record of burning through seven coaches in 13 years is also a red flag that Hurley shouldn't ignore. Frank Vogel lasted two seasons after winning a championship. Darvin Ham was ousted the year after reaching the Western Conference finals. Who's to say that Hurley wouldn't be scapegoated the first time things go awry?\n\nAt UConn, Hurley has the job security that comes with engineering the greatest two-year run in modern men's college basketball history.\n\nIn 2023, a UConn team led by , Andre Jackson and trounced its six NCAA tournament opponents by 20 points per game. Five of that team's top eight players moved on, yet last season's Huskies proved to be even more unbeatable, winning six NCAA tournament games by a record-setting 23.3 points apiece.\n\nThe college game may be tough on coaches these days, but Hurley has thrived better than anyone else amid the chaos. He has found a formula that works for him, sometimes passing on the most talented prospects in favor of team-first freshmen and transfers who prioritize winning and who aren't afraid to be coached hard.\n\nThanks to Hurley, UConn now has a chance to become the first program to three-peat since the heyday of John Wooden's UCLA dynasty. The Huskies are a fixture in way-too-early preseason top fives thanks to the return of standout forward Alex Karaban and the arrival of a bevy of accomplished newcomers.\n\nWhen speaking with Francesa earlier this week, Hurley acknowledged that leaving the northeast in general and UConn in particular would be hard for him. He said he hopes to stay \"as long as we're able to find these old school folks to bring into our program and then we just blend it with modern basketball.\"\n\n\"If we keep doing it like this,\" added Hurley, \"I'll stay here and the NBA will never be a thing.\"\n\nMaybe Hurley should take his own advice. Maybe he should leverage the Lakers' interest into a big raise and then stay where he is beloved.\n\nCoaching the Lakers is a job you can't pass up, except maybe Hurley should.", "source": {"uri":

While any announcement regarding Redick would have come after the NBA Finals -- since Redick is announcing them for ESPN -- a Hurley announcement could be finalized in the coming days.\n\nFans of college basketball are very familiar with Hurley, but the same might not be true for fans of the NBA. So, here's everything there is to know about Hurley, the potential next head coach of the Lakers.\n\nHurley, 51, was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1973. His father, Bob Hurley Sr., was a Hall of Fame high school basketball coach, and his brother, Bobby, is currently the head coach at Arizona State University.\n\nHurley played basketball under his father at St. Anthony High School, before playing at the collegiate level at Seton Hall University. After he finished his senior year, he immediately began a career in coaching.\n\nIn the 1996-97 season, Hurley was an assistant at his alma mater St. Anthony High School. In 1997, he was hired as an assistant at Rutgers University, where he stayed until 2001.\n\nIn 2001, Hurley got his first head coaching gig at Saint Benedict's Prep School, where he remained until 2010. He then got his first head coaching gig at the collegiate level with Wagner College, where he set the school's single-season win-loss record at 25-6.\n\nFrom Wagner, Hurley went to the University of Rhode Island, where he'd spend six seasons, leading them to the NCAA Tournament in his final two.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, Hurley was named the head coach at the University of Connecticut. In 2021 and 2022, he led them to the NCAA Tournament. And in 2023 and 2024, he led them to back-to-back NCAA Tournament wins.\n\nIn the 2022-23 season, Hurley led the Huskies to a surprise NCAA Tournament run as a No. 4 seed, beating the No. 5-seeded San Diego State Aztecs in the National Title game. In the 2023-24 season, the Huskies were much more dominant, winning a school-record 37 games en route to the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament. UConn won every tournament game by double digits on their way to a second consecutive National Championship. They were one of the most dominant teams in NCAA history, and Hurley took home the Naismith College Coach of the Year award.\n\nLess than two months ago, at UConn's National Championship parade, Hurley emphatically exclaimed that he has no intentions of leaving the school for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Maybe down the road, you hope you can mature enough emotionally to, much later in my career, to try to take a shot at the NBA -- down the road, way down the road,\" Hurley said following UConn's parade. \"I'm not going to coach anywhere else in college, unless UConn doesn't want me here.\"\n\nThat road could end up reaching a dead end sooner than expected, though, if Hurley elects to take the job with the Lakers.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Lakers are understood to have had preliminary discussion with the 51-year-old, who has spoken about his ambition to coach in the NBA, but are yet to make a formal offer.\n\nHurley's reputation for developing player talent may be a particular lure for the Lakers. New league rules make it harder for teams to be built around three star players, making developing younger players more important. Hurley could theoretically help improve talented younger players who are already on the Lakers roster, such as Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Max Christie, behind their established stars, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. There have also been rumours in recent months that the Lakers could draft James's eldest son, Bronny, this year.

Lakers are hoping Hurley can develop their young core without the need for a third star like Mitchell or Young. Despite no prior NBA experience, Hurley can take on this huge responsibility.\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, the Los Angeles Lakers have made Dan Hurley their main coaching target. After weeks of reports about other candidates, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski confirmed on Thursday morning that the Lakers are now focused on the UConn Huskies coach.\n\nThe Lakers' head coaching vacancy has been one of the biggest storylines in the league despite the ongoing NBA playoffs. There have been a lot of rumors regarding possible replacements ever since they let go of Darvin Ham a month ago. Former player and the current host of the Mind Games podcast, JJ Redick was the front-runner until Wednesday. Or it appeared so, at least until Wojnarowski broke the news about Hurley.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, \"part of the allure\" for Hurley is down to the new tax apron rules which have completely changed roster building. It has forced teams to develop their own talent, especially through the NBA Draft, instead of trying to create a super team. As a result, the Lakers' hunt for a third star like Donovan Mitchell or Trae Young might have come to an end. Instead, the Lakers front office is banking on Hurley to develop their young core, which features Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and Max Christie.\n\nWhile Christie is yet to lock his place down in the rotation, Hachimura and Reaves have already become vital playoff performers in LA. The Lakers will be hoping Hurley can help this core to keep growing, after it felt like they might have reached their ceiling following a dismal first round exit this season.\n\nCan the Lakers Compete Without Adding a Third Star? The playoff success they've had in the last few years has come without one\n\nThe Lakers brought in LeBron James as a free agent in 2018. Just a year later, they made a splash to partner him with Anthony Davis. That decision paid dividends immediately as the Lakers won the 2020 NBA championship led by their star duo. Just a year later, in a move to keep up with other 'big threes' in the league, they tore down their roster to add a third star in Russell Westbrook, a move that completely killed their title aspirations.\n\nThe next time they found some kind of success was immediately after they traded him away and went back to surrounding their two stars with a capable roster, like they did in 2020. Although their run came to an end in the Western Conference Finals, it was at the hands of the eventual champions, the Denver Nuggets.\n\nLakers record since 2020\n\nSeason\n\nDid they have a third star?\n\nRecord\n\nPlayoff results\n\n2019-20\n\nNo\n\n52-19\n\nChampions\n\n2020-21\n\nNo\n\n42-30\n\nFirst round exit\n\n2021-22\n\nYes\n\n33-49\n\nMissed playoffs\n\n2022-23\n\nNo (after trade deadline)\n\n43-39\n\nWCF\n\n2023-24\n\nNo\n\n47-35\n\nFirst round exit\n\nThe Lakers front office is well aware at this point how to maximize their duo's potential; by keeping them a duo. The new tax rules are just a blessing in disguise to quell any attempts to add a third star, which would come at a heavy cost, one which they are not in a position to pay.\n\nBig Responsibility for Hurley if He Signs Can the NCAA coach with no NBA experience keep up with the Lake Show?\n\nHurley started his coaching career with Wagner College in 2010. He worked his way to UConn in 2018, following a successful six-year stint at Rhode Island. In the 2023-24 season, he led the Huskies to their first NCAA title in a decade and then led them to a repeat this season, the first-ever repeat in school history. But is that experience enough to help him in the NBA?\n\nDan Hurley NCAA coaching record\n\nTeam\n\nRecord\n\nHonors\n\nWagner\n\n38-23\n\nNA\n\nRhode Island\n\n113-82\n\nA-10 tournament (2017) A-10 regular season (2018)\n\nUConn\n\n141-58\n\n2x NCAA Tournament champion Big East regular season (2024) Big East tournament (2024)\n\nCoaches who were successful in the NCAA have usually had a hard time making the transition. Rick Pitino, Fred Hoiberg, and John Beilein are some of those coaches who struggled to make the jump. In recent history, only Brad Stevens and Billy Donovan have come close to being successful, and still, they fell short of a championship.\n\nBack in April, Hurley said that he would only consider the NBA \"way down the road\", but he probably wouldn't have guessed that the biggest franchise would come knocking just two months later. He will certainly have his hands full if he joins the Lakers. But if the front office surrounds him with a capable team of assistants and are patient with him, he might be able to work his magic in the NBA as well.\n\nRelated Longtime ESPN Broadcaster Set to Make History in 2024 NBA Finals Doris Burke has been knocking on the door for years.

Hurley has led UConn to back-to-back national championships, elevating his status as the top active coach in college basketball. Hurley, who began his coaching career at the high school level, has not coached in the NBA, but built the Huskies into a powerhouse that is 52-5 in its last 57 games.\n\nHis move to Los Angeles would be significant for a Lakers team coming off a first-round playoff exit. Los Angeles is hopeful of keeping star LeBron James, who must decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season by June 29.\n\nJames appears to be a fan. In April, responding to an interview JJ Redick conducted with Hurley for his podcast, James wrote on X: \"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it.\"\n\nA move would also send shockwaves throughout college basketball, with the coach of its preeminent program -- and one of the faces of the sport -- departing late in the calendar, nearly two months after most coaching carousel activity.

Redick was the first candidate to have a face-to-face meeting with the Lakers three weeks ago, and Borrego did an in-person interview with Lakers officials for a second time last week and the franchise has been impressed with him during the process, according to team sources.

It seems that now could be the time as Hurley is seriously considering taking the Lakers job, as evidenced by him already speaking with his UConn team about it.\n\nAccording to John Fanta of Fox Sports, Hurley is split on what decision he should make:\n\nA source tells FOX Sports that Hurley is \"truly at a 50-50\" in weighing his decision whether to make the leap up for LeBron James and the Lakers or stay in the college game and try to achieve something unthinkable in the modern era.\n\n\"He deals with things mentally where he's constantly seeking to prove what he can do,\" a source told FOX Sports.\n\nWhile Hurley has a big decision to make, he is expected to make it soon and won't drag this out for UConn and the Lakers:\n\nHurley's plan is to have his mind made up on the decision weighing on him in the near future, a source said.\n\nIt's always possible that Hurley leaked this news himself in order to get a lucrative extension to stay at UConn. But it appears that has already been on the table for him:\n\nAs for Hurley's current position, a source tells FOX Sports that the University of Connecticut has offered the coach a lucrative new contract that would make him one of the highest-paid coaches in the country, featuring significant widespread benefits for him. Hurley said Wednesday that \"it's complicated, and it's taken more time (to get a deal done) than any of us would have liked. It's not something that's been a rush for me. You sacrifice a lot to do this job. The job beats your ass pretty good, and a lot suffers with your family. Any chance at a social life, it consumes everything you have.\"\n\nMoney may not be the motivating factor here as Hurley seems to have a big offer on the table from the Lakers as well as a big extension offer from UConn.\n\nIf that is the case then it will come down to if Hurley is comfortable at UConn, hoping to three-peat next season, or if he wants to take on a new challenge on the opposite coast with one of the most historic franchises in sports.\n\nIf Dan Hurley did decide to leave for the Lakers then L.A. would be on the hook for his $1.875 million UConn buyout.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_starkand@lakersnation.com", "name": "Daniel Starkand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dan-Hurley-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Hurley signed a six-year, $32.1 million extension to stay with UConn last summer, and with this Lakers news dropping, it's also possible the university could give him another raise to stay.\n\nRegardless though, if Hurley was to leave UConn for L.A. then the Lakers would be on the hook for a $1.875 million buyout, per Shams Charania and Sam Vecenie of The Athletic:\n\nHurley signed a six-year, $32.1 million contract with UConn in 2023, after the first of the back-to-back titles. The contract includes a separate, heavily reduced buyout if Hurley leaves for an NBA head-coaching position -- $1.875 million, versus a $7.5 million buyout if he leaves for a college head-coaching job.\n\nThe Lakers have been cheap when hiring new coaches in their past few searches, but it is clear that if they want to land a big fish like Hurley then they will need to pay top dollar. And all indications are that they are willing to do so, which means it will be up to the two-time championship winning coach to make a decision on his future.\n\nPaying a $1.875 million buyout would be the least of the Lakers' issues, especially if they are willing to give Hurley a massive contract to be their coach. But luckily, a buyout for a coach making the jump to the NBA is significantly less than if Hurley were to leave for another school.\n\nThe reporting on the Lakers' coaching search all along has been that ESPN analyst JJ Redick is the favorite to land the job.\n\nThere was not even a mention of Dan Hurley's name before Thursday morning, but as it turns out, he was at the forefront of the team's coaching search from the beginning.\n\nIt will now be up to Jeanie Buss and Rob Pelinka to close the deal, or else they might have to circle back to Redick and the other candidates they've been speaking with.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_starkand@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Daniel Starkand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dan-Hurley-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Dan Hurley, the head coach of the University of Connecticut men's basketball team is not merely the frontrunner, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, but the forthcoming recipient of a \"massive, long-term contract offer.\"\n\nThe news comes after days of rumors connecting the Lakers to J.J. Redick, the 19-year NBA veteran and current broadcaster. Wojnarowski reports the Lakers are \"planning to escalate discussions in the coming days.\"\n\nDarvin Ham was let go just two years into his four-season contract, despite having led the Lakers to a Western Conference Finals appearance just last year.\n\nUnder Hurley, UConn won its second consecutive NCAA men's basketball championship in April, capping an incredible 37-3 regular season. All of his head coaching experience has been compiled in the college or prep ranks. Prior to UConn (2018-24), Hurley was the head coach at Rhode Island (2012-18) and Wagner (2010-12).\n\nHurley's brother, Bobby, made a name for himself playing for Duke and the Sacramento Kings, and is the current head coach at Arizona State.\n\nAppearing on ESPN on Thursday, Wojnarowski said Hurley \"has been the target of the Lakers' search since the beginning,\" noting that Hurley has publicly expressed ambitions of making the leap to the NBA before.\n\nThe substance of that report constitutes a bombshell after Shams Charania of The Athletic reported Tuesday that the Lakers were \"zeroing in\" on Redick, the longtime NBA sharpshooter, as their top candidate.\n\nFor NBA fans, Redick was the more familiar name, an ex-player whose media personality would seem to lend itself to a major market. In addition to his duties as an analyst on ESPN, Redick hosts a pair of podcasts on his own network: \"The Old Man And The Three\" and \"Mind The Game,\" the latter of which is co-hosted by current Lakers All-Star LeBron James.\n\nRedick enjoyed an outstanding career as a critical role player on several playoff contenders from 2006-21. He finished with career averages of 12.8 points on .447/.415/.892 shooting, as well as two rebounds and two assists across 940 career regular season games.\n\nWojnarowski notes the Lakers' offer to Hurley comes on the 20th anniversary of their ill-fated attempt to hire Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski to a record-breaking deal. Although Krzyzewski elected to remain at Duke, the fluidity of transfers in college sports and NIL rights has transformed the NCAA atmosphere into a more NBA-like environment.\n\nPerhaps that also influenced the Lakers' decision to make a strong run at arguably the best head coach in the college game.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_paul_hoornstra@newsweek.com", "name": "Jon Paul Hoornstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2405048/uconn-dan-hurley.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3db8929cb73267e905c6ad66d637b2e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst who does a podcast with James; Hurley, the back-to-back national championship-winning coach of the Huskies; and James Borrego, the respected former Charlotte Hornets coach and ex-Gregg Popovich assistant who spent last season on New Orleans' staff.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Lakers aren't commenting publicly on the search to replace Ham.\n\nFILE - UConn head coach Dan Hurley calls towards his players during the first half of the Elite 8 college basketball game against Illinois in the men's NCAA Tournament, Saturday, March 30, 2024, in Boston.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne, File)\n\nBut they sure are commenting privately.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Athletic reported that Redick shockingly was the frontrunner despite his total lack of coaching experience. On Thursday, the search took another wild turn when ESPN reported the Lakers were instead targeting Hurley, whose candidacy hadn't even been mentioned in many discussions of the job.\n\nThe crazy twists are representative of the various factions within the Lakers brain trust of owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka dispensing narratives to their favored media outlets. The Lakers previously seemed unlikely to make an official hire before the end of the NBA Finals, but the person who spoke to the AP said even that could change, depending on their progress.\n\nWhile the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics waited a week to begin the NBA Finals, the Lakers have dominated talk radio, television and message boards with speculation on the best choice to lead James and the Lakers back to contention for a second title together.\n\nThe Lakers are making their coaching change at a critical juncture for the franchise's partnership with the NBA's career scoring leader.\n\nThe 39-year-old James just completed his 21st season while playing at a higher level than anyone with that much experience in basketball history, but he has until June 29 to decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nJames could take the deal, or he could sign an even bigger new contract for more years - or he could become a free agent for the first time in six years.\n\nWhile 31-year-old Anthony Davis is the Lakers' foundation with a long-term contract in Los Angeles, Buss and Pelinka are clearly determined to keep James alongside him for as long as possible - even publicly floating their willingness to draft his son, Bronny, who just completed one brief collegiate season at USC.\n\nWhile agent Rich Paul has said James is not involved in the coaching search as he prepares to play for the U.S. at the Paris Olympics, the Lakers' candidates seem designed to appeal to him.\n\nJames' connection with Redick is well-known. James also recently praised Hurley on social media following a podcast interview between Redick and Hurley, with the 20-time All-Star writing that Hurley is \"so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their (offense). Love it.\"\n\nHurley has won 141 games in six seasons at UConn, rolling to the past two national titles in impressive fashion. The addition of the nation's top collegiate coach to the Lakers could be enticing to James and his son, who likely still needs extensive development to be a serviceable NBA player.\n\nThe Lakers' relative underachievement this season despite a healthy James and Davis was primarily blamed on Ham, the first-time head coach who dismayed many fans and observers with his rotations, preparation and strategic acumen. The Lakers have chased savvy basketball minds in their latest search, no matter their pedigree: Redick's encyclopedic understanding of the game has been on display in his podcast with James, while Hurley favors an NBA-friendly style of play that should translate well to the biggest basketball stage.\n\nWhoever they choose, the Lakers will be adding yet another head coach at a pace typically reserved for underachieving European soccer teams, not powerhouse NBA franchises.\n\nThe new hire will be the Lakers' eighth coach since Phil Jackson's departure in 2011 and their fourth coach since James arrived as a free agent in 2018. Frank Vogel led Los Angeles to the 2020 championship, but kept the job for only 225 games over three seasons before being fired exactly 18 months after raising the trophy in the Florida bubble.\n\nHam was the fourth coach fired by James' teams in the past eight years, joining Cleveland's David Blatt and the Lakers' Luke Walton and Vogel.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n\nFILE - Former Orlando Magic guard JJ Redick, center, leaves the court after being honored by the team during the first half of an NBA basketball game against the New York Knicks, Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2024, in Orlando, Fla.

UConn has won back-to-back NCAA tournaments under Hurley over the last two seasons. The Lakers are looking for a coach to replace Darvin Ham after getting eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets this spring.\n\nFormer Duke and NBA player J.J. Redick had been seen as the frontrunner for the Lakers job in recent days. But the Lakers are reportedly preparing to offer Hurley a \"massive\" contract for him to come to the NBA.\n\nHurley, 51, would take over a team that's looking for one more push to the Finals with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. After winning the 2020 NBA Finals, the Lakers have lost twice in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in 2022. In Ham's first season in 2022-23, the Lakers got the No. 7 seed and advanced to the Western Conference Finals before getting swept by the Nuggets.\n\nJames, who turns 40 in December, has a player option on his contract for the 2024-25 season that needs to be picked up by June 29. On the assumption that it's picked up -- there are no signs he will not -- James and Davis will make a combined $90 million next season.\n\nThere's limited financial and roster flexibility for the Lakers beyond James and Davis too. The team does have its 2024 first-round pick at No. 17 after the Pelicans opted to gamble on the Lakers' roster and take the team's 2025 first-round pick earlier this summer as part of the deal for Davis. With that pick, the team's 2029 first-round pick and other players on the roster, Los Angeles could be in the market to upgrade for a No. 3 player alongside its star duo.\n\nHowever, a move for another top-tier player could significantly hurt the team's depth and force the Lakers to rely on minimum-salary players for a large portion of the roster. Just ask the Phoenix Suns how that went this season. The Suns were bounced in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first season with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal all on the same team.\n\nHurley is 292-163 as a college coach\n\nHurley has won nearly 300 games across 14 seasons as a head coach at the top level of men's college basketball. After two seasons at Wagner, Hurley took over at Rhode Island. He turned the Rams into a 23-win team in his third season after Rhode Island went 8-21 in year one.\n\nAfter taking the Rams to back-to-back NCAA tournaments in 2017 and 2018, Hurley was hired at UConn. The Huskies were a mess when he was brought in. UConn had finished under .500 in each of the past two seasons and had made just one NCAA tournament appearance since winning the national title in 2014.\n\nUConn was 16-17 in Hurley's first season before winning 19 games in year two before the COVID-19 pandemic prematurely ended the college basketball season. Since then, UConn has made the NCAA tournament four straight times and UConn has become the prominent program in men's college basketball.\n\nThe Huskies have obliterated their opponents in each of the past two NCAA tournaments. In 2023, UConn beat every team it played in the tournament by at least 13 points on the way to a national title win over San Diego State.\n\nUConn was even better in 2023-24. The Huskies lost just three games all season and beat their NCAA tournament opponents by even more. UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 14 points. The Huskies beat Alabama 86-72 in the Final Four before beating Purdue 75-60 in the national title game.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hurley, regarded as one of the best coaches in the mens college game, is coming off of his second-straight national championship with the Huskies.\n\nHurley, Wojnarowski wrote, is being considered for the job based off of his tactical acumen and player-development skills. He reported that Hurley has been at the forefront of the head coaching search throughout the entire process, despite the Lakers exploring other options.\n\nThere was no word on whether Hurley would plan to accept a potential offer.\n\nIn his 14 years as a head coach at the Division I level, Hurley has racked up an impressive record of 292-163 at Wagner College, Providence and later UConn. He's risen to mainstream prominence in recent years after guiding the Huskies to the last two NCAA titles.\n\nHurley, 51, was expected to have another title-contending team in 2024-25, despite losing a massive amount of talent to the NBA Draft.\n\nThe news comes amid rumors and reports that the Lakers were looking in another unconventional direction for their head coaching vacancy. The job has been linked to former Duke and NBA player JJ Reddick, who started a podcast with Lakers' superstar LeBron James earlier this year.\n\nWhile Reddick, who played 17 years in the league and is known best for his stints with the Orlando Magic and L.A. Clippers, has never coached basketball in a formal role. He does have clear chemistry with James, however the aging legend's future with the team is in question.\n\nThe Lakers job will likely pose a challenge for the new coach regardless, as James, who will turn 40 in the middle of the next season, could opt out of his Lakers' contract before free agency begins. Even if he chooses to stay in the purple and gold, there will be added pressure on the next coach to win immediately as James enters what's sure to be the final seasons of his illustrious career.\n\nThe Lakers' 2023-24 season came to a disappointing end in the first round of the NBA Playoffs when they fell to the Denver Nuggets for the second-straight year, this time in five games.

Hurley is renowned for his strategic acumen and player development skills, qualities that have positioned him as the Lakers' top choice in their quest to replace Darvin Ham, who was let go in May following the team's early exit from the playoffs.\n\nHurley inked a six-year, $32 million deal with UConn last year, but sources indicate that the Lakers are presenting him with a lucrative, long-term contract offer. While initial discussions have taken place between the 51-year-old coach and the Lakers, no formal offer has been extended as of yet. Hurley has expressed his aspirations to coach in the NBA, making the Lakers' interest all the more enticing for him.\n\nThe Lakers are drawn to Hurley's track record of nurturing player talent, a crucial factor in light of the NBA's evolving landscape where reliance on three star players is no longer as viable. Developing emerging talents like Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and Max Christie alongside established stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis could be instrumental in the Lakers' future success. Speculations have also surfaced about the Lakers potentially drafting LeBron's eldest son, Bronny, this year, with Hurley's involvement in the young player's growth being a significant draw for the franchise.\n\nLeBron James has previously expressed his admiration for Hurley, praising his coaching prowess and creativity.

Hurley and the Lakers have had preliminary talks about the job. Sources told ESPN that the parties intend to intensify their talks in the days ahead. Hurley has led the Lakers' search from the start, according to insiders. Even though the team has interviewed a number of other applicants as part of its due diligence. This goes against the widely reported idea that JJ Redick was in the pole position to become the franchise's next head coach.\n\nRumor has it that governor Jeanie Buss, general manager, and vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka are eager to formally discuss their vision of combining Hurley's dominant program, which is based on his tactical acumen and elite player development -- with the legendary Lakers brand. The Athletic's Shams Charania has been reporting for what seems like weeks that Redick was the clear frontrunner. Shams reported that it was only a matter of time before JJ Redick was named head coach. Woj has thrown a wrench into that line of thinking, and a massive deal is being drawn up for Hurley.\n\nRead More: JJ Redick Is Reportedly The Frontrunner And Close To Becoming The Lakers' Next Head Coach\n\nAccording to insiders, Dan Hurley has frequently talked about his goal of becoming an NBA coach. Additionally, he has told the Lakers that he would like to explore the possibility of working with one of the most successful teams in basketball. LeBron James is said to have been impressed with Hurley's sophisticated offensive acumen. Hurley becomes an even more fascinating contender if James decides to return to Los Angeles in free agency. Bronny James could be selected as the 55th choice in this month's NBA draft. This could make things more interesting to LeBron. Should that take place, Hurley and his team will take on the responsibility of overseeing Bronny's professional development. Ultimately giving James the opportunity to play alongside his son.\n\nAll in all, the JJ Redick Lakers era seems to have never been as sure fire thing as it has been reported to be. JJ Redick was one of several candidates who interviewed and has been in talks with the Lakers. Shams has been reporting that he is the clear frontrunner. It seems like his sources were off the mark this time around, as it seems like the Lakers are drafting up a substantial deal to bring in Hurley. JJ did say he would break his silence on Shams reports after the finals so it will be interesting to see what he has to say.

The Los Angeles Lakers' reported plan to offer a massive contract to UConn coach Dan Hurley is the latest twist in the monthlong race to replace Darvin Ham. According to a person with knowledge of the lengthy search, the Lakers have strongly considered J.J. Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers' coaching search has been very public, seemingly chaotic and dominated by famous names.\n\nTotally Hollywood, in other words.\n\nThe Lakers' reported plan to offer a massive contract to UConn coach Dan Hurley is the latest twist in the monthlong race to replace Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 after two seasons.\n\nThe Lakers were knocked out of the first round of the current playoffs, but the 17-time NBA champion franchise has nicely filled the void of hoops drama during the week before the NBA Finals with steady leaks about the progress of their quest for a coach who can win a title -- and almost as vitally, a coach who can entice LeBron James to finish his career in purple and gold.\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the lengthy search, the Lakers have strongly considered J.J. Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst who does a podcast with James; Hurley, the back-to-back national championship-winning coach of the Huskies; and James Borrego, the respected former Charlotte Hornets coach and ex-Gregg Popovich assistant who spent last season on New Orleans' staff.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Lakers aren't commenting publicly on the search to replace Ham.\n\nBut they sure are commenting privately.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Athletic reported that Redick shockingly was the frontrunner despite his total lack of coaching experience. On Thursday, the search took another wild turn when ESPN reported the Lakers were instead targeting Hurley, whose candidacy hadn't even been mentioned in many discussions of the job.\n\nThe crazy twists are representative of the various factions within the Lakers brain trust of owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka dispensing narratives to their favored media outlets. The Lakers previously seemed unlikely to make an official hire before the end of the NBA Finals, but the person who spoke to the AP said even that could change, depending on their progress.\n\nWhile the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics waited a week to begin the NBA Finals, the Lakers have dominated talk radio, television and message boards with speculation on the best choice to lead James and the Lakers back to contention for a second title together.\n\nThe Lakers are making their coaching change at a critical juncture for the franchise's partnership with the NBA's career scoring leader.\n\nThe 39-year-old James just completed his 21st season while playing at a higher level than anyone with that much experience in basketball history, but he has until June 29 to decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nJames could take the deal, or he could sign an even bigger new contract for more years -- or he could become a free agent for the first time in six years.\n\nWhile 31-year-old Anthony Davis is the Lakers' foundation with a long-term contract in Los Angeles, Buss and Pelinka are clearly determined to keep James alongside him for as long as possible -- even publicly floating their willingness to draft his son, Bronny, who just completed one brief collegiate season at USC.\n\nWhile agent Rich Paul has said James is not involved in the coaching search as he prepares to play for the U.S. at the Paris Olympics, the Lakers' candidates seem designed to appeal to him.\n\nJames' connection with Redick is well-known. James also recently praised Hurley on social media following a podcast interview between Redick and Hurley, with the 20-time All-Star writing that Hurley is \"so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their (offense). Love it.\"\n\nHurley has won 141 games in six seasons at UConn, rolling to the past two national titles in impressive fashion. The addition of the nation's top collegiate coach to the Lakers could be enticing to James and his son, who likely still needs extensive development to be a serviceable NBA player.\n\nThe Lakers' relative underachievement this season despite a healthy James and Davis was primarily blamed on Ham, the first-time head coach who dismayed many fans and observers with his rotations, preparation and strategic acumen. The Lakers have chased savvy basketball minds in their latest search, no matter their pedigree: Redick's encyclopedic understanding of the game has been on display in his podcast with James, while Hurley favors an NBA-friendly style of play that should translate well to the biggest basketball stage.\n\nWhoever they choose, the Lakers will be adding yet another head coach at a pace typically reserved for underachieving European soccer teams, not powerhouse NBA franchises.\n\nThe new hire will be the Lakers' eighth coach since Phil Jackson's departure in 2011 and their fourth coach since James arrived as a free agent in 2018. Frank Vogel led Los Angeles to the 2020 championship, but kept the job for only 225 games over three seasons before being fired exactly 18 months after raising the trophy in the Florida bubble.\n\nHam was the fourth coach fired by James' teams in the past eight years, joining Cleveland's David Blatt and the Lakers' Luke Walton and Vogel.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA", "source": {"uri":

The head coach of the reigning back-to-back national champion Connecticut Huskies has talked for years about the prospect in his career of coaching an NBA team someday.\n\nWith reports surfacing on Thursday morning that L.A. is targeting the 51-year-old in its crucial coaching search, there are a variety of layers to consider.\n\nFirst off, Hurley has accomplished everything he can at the college level. Sure, if he joins John Wooden and leads UConn to a 3-peat, that would be a historic accomplishment, but there's also a sense of it being the same thing he's done the last two years -- if we are looking at it the way Hurley sees his life and career.\n\nHurley, the brother of Duke legend and Arizona State head coach Bobby and the son of high school legend Bob Sr., has coached with a chip on his shoulder, fueled to make his mark in a family where he was previously the afterthought, but now is the centerpiece.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, (winning the title) was an incredible feeling in the moment, but it hasn't fulfilled me in a way that maybe I thought it would,\" Hurley told The Athletic after winning his first championship. \"I was probably chasing that championship thinking there'd be some level of healing. It's like realizing there's no Santa Claus.\"\n\nThat quote signifies how Hurley thinks, and why there's no better window of opportunity than the present. The Santa Claus of basketball jobs in brand, potential and wonder is to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. You could be a cynic and say it's also a very difficult job filled with wild expectations, but Hurley's ego and larger-than-life personality are powered by the prospect of chasing after the next big thing. Well, there's no bigger thing than the potential of being on a stage with a Larry O'Brien trophy alongside LeBron James and winning a world championship.\n\nWe know the 39-year-old James approves of Hurley, as he's publicly made known after Hurley's appearance on JJ Redick's podcast -- oh, the irony. But Hurley's college background and ability to develop talent would have to make LeBron feel comfortable if his son, Bronny, becomes part of the LA organization and is going through the developmental structure of it. The Lakers' G League team is literally embedded with the Lakers at the UCLA Health Training Center, so there's a connectivity present and the thought of Hurley joining the fold and knowing what a younger prospect looks like and how to address that elephant in the room would likely make James happy.\n\nBut does this make sense for the Lakers, who originally were thought to be hiring the 39-year-old Redick away from the broadcast booth and into his first coaching job?\n\nIt's no secret that the reaction to early reports that Redick could be the guy produced plenty of discourse and questions entailing whether he was fit to take on this job, having never coached, and having to deal with LeBron, Anthony Davis and the very high expectations set on Rodeo Drive. Did Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka see this discourse or start to buy in to the potential cons of hiring Redick and shift in a different direction? Perhaps.\n\nThe $1 million question is this: if Hurley was always the candidate they wanted, why now? Why on June 6 are they just having these conversations? The college season has been over for two months, and Hurley just got rising junior star Alex Karaban to come back to UConn to pursue history. He's been handling this offseason with the same intensity that he's handled everything. But that's another reason why it's a no-brainer for Hurley to take this job if he's offered it.\n\nHurley has jokingly, but also seriously, shown his dislike for college basketball's current atmosphere, where close to 2,000 transfers are in the portal and building a roster is all about a neverending financial bidding war that also entails making sure you've got the pieces that properly fit your puzzle. In the college game, the offseason or thought of one is really gone because of everything that roster building entails. It's an unhealthy lifestyle for coaches, but one that Hurley has mastered in how much he's won the last two years. But that lack of being able to sustain it, and what feels like a road of chaos that won't end in the sport, further pales in comparison when looking at being an NBA coach.\n\n\"Maybe just burnout for me,\" Hurley said in April when asked what would make him leave Connecticut. \"You know, it could be pushing too hard and probably just breaking down at some point because you just can't keep up the intensity, and energy, and output. Maybe down the road, I could grow up a little bit and mature with the emotions, and maybe (a coaching job) in the NBA would be the way to go. College has become like the G League. The college game has changed. You win the national championship, and obviously you have the parade and the White House, but you're right into free agency frenzy. I'm worried about the burnout (of that).\"\n\nTwenty years ago, the Lakers offered Mike Krzyzewski a five-year, $40 million contract. The amount of $8 million per year two decades ago was a seismic financial offer, but the circumstances of the college game and the way Coach K could flourish in it are totally different than what they are now.\n\nHere's another layer to consider: Hurley's aggressive personality on the sidelines and his demeanor with officials and players.\n\nI would say this: I think much of Hurley's antics on the sidelines are an act, and he would change if it meant he could be an NBA head coach. Tony Brothers or Scott Foster are not putting up with all of that. But to those that call Hurley insane on the sidelines, I fully believe much of what he does is calculated. He would understand he has to change that, because if he didn't understand it, we wouldn't be talking about the head coach of the repeat national champions to begin with.\n\nAs for how he coaches players, he is a mad scientist in the lab in Storrs. I've seen him motivate players to a major degree, nearing that line but never crossing it in the way you can drive kids to their best point. Obviously, the NBA is a totally different animal and you're not going to be able to break players down to then build them back up.\n\nBut it's exactly all of these questions about whether Hurley could handle this move to Los Angeles that has to drive his thought process to take this position. He is fueled by people telling him he can't do something. The Lakers are a crown jewel brand in sports. He's proven all one can at the college level, and while Hurley once said a move to the NBA would not come until \"way down the road,\" the situational potential, the opportunity to be alongside LeBron in L.A. and the long-term financial commitment from a name brand like this one is an opportunity that comes off as one-of-a-kind in Hurley's career arc.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com",

Several suitors have a chance to land the job, including UConn head coach Dan Hurley and player-turned-analyst JJ Redick. However, reports indicate that Hurley has emerged as the lead candidate. As a result, one renowned sports personality believes former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is pulling strings behind the scenes.\n\nIn mid-May. reports suggested Mike Krzyzewski was an \"unofficial resource\" in the Lakers' head coach search. At the time, Los Angeles was rumored to be high on JJ Redick, but their pivot to Dan Hurley has Barstool Sports podcaster Dan Katz proposing an intriguing conspiracy theory.\n\n\"Just a reminder. There's a good chance Coach K is behind all of this. He knew Hurley would surpass him in record speed. So what does he do? He becomes an \"unofficial resource\" in the Lakers HC search and tells them Hurley is the only guy for the job,\" Katz wrote on X.\n\nKatz added another interesting take on Krzyzewski's influence.\n\n\"Just so sad that Coach K can't leave the College game alone in retirement. He isn't content just walking off into the sunset. He has to also ruin the entire sport and try to completely kill it forever,\" Katz added.\n\nIs Dan Katz right? Could Mike Mike Krzyzewski be the reason Los Angeles is favoring Hurley for their vacancy? The irony is Krzyzewski was once offered the Lakers' head coaching job in 2004. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski added to the subplot with another bold take on the former Duke coach.\n\n\"If Mike Krzyzewski was in the same position, at the same age, with the way college basketball has changed, he almost assuredly would probably be the Lakers coach,\" Wojnarowski said via Get Up ESPN.\n\nWill Dan Hurley win the Lakers' favor over JJ Reddick, others?\n\nDan Hurley is a winning coach who could help take the Lakers to the next level if offered the job. Hurley has led the highly respected UConn basketball team to two consecutive national championships. He has helped the Huskies maintain themselves as a national force.\n\nOf course, he would have his hands full with the challenges the Lakers are facing.

The team made the NBA Playoffs after defeating the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the Play-In Tournament. However, LA lost their first-round series 4-1 to the reigning champion Denver Nuggets.\n\nLos Angeles has many questions about its roster going into 2024-25. LeBron James is approaching his 22nd second season. His window to win another title is closing.

However, in what seems like the 11th hour, the Lakers are reportedly pivoting towards making UConn Huskies head coach Dan Hurley their number one target.\n\nHurley has been making waves in the coaching world amid UConn's run of dominance. The Huskies have stood tall in the collegiate basketball world over the past two seasons, and Hurley's stock has skyrocketed accordingly. But beyond his deep knowledge of the game's Xs and Os, the Lakers might be looking to bring Hurley in for his ability to develop young talent, which would work well should the Purple and Gold decide to select Bronny James on draft night.\n\n\"You're gonna have to grow your young players. The idea of Bronny James in the Lakers; who better, potentially, than Dan Hurley, to be the development coach to lead his growth. [He's a] coach who's really dominated the college sport. You talk about Xs and Os acumen, player development... from day one of this Lakers search, it has been Dan Hurley,\" Adrian Wojnarowski said via UNSPORTSMANLIKE Radio on ESPN.\n\nIndeed, bringing LeBron James' firstborn son does not come without its fair share of risk; the Lakers have the 17th and 56th overall selections for the upcoming draft, and the last thing the Lakers would want is to bring Bronny in but fail to put him in a position where he could develop properly.\n\nWojnarowski added that some of the NBA coaches he has talked to said that the coaching smarts of Dan Hurley will translate to the NBA game and the Lakers clearly believe this to be the case given that they're in hot pursuit of the UConn head coach. Bringing Hurley in, however, could potentially kill off two birds with one stone -- bringing in an experienced coach who is widely regarded, even by LeBron, while also having someone who could bring out the best in Bronny.\n\nBronny James, the unknown of the 2024 NBA Draft\n\nEveryone knows the deal with Bronny James by now; any team that selects him in the draft will have a real shot at acquiring the services of LeBron James given how strongly James has expressed his desire to play with his firstborn son. Alas, drafting Bronny isn't a guarantee that LeBron will be coming in a package deal, which is what makes the 19-year old guard out of USC the biggest question mark of the draft.\n\nClutchPoints NBA insider Brett Siegel wrote that Bronny could go anywhere from 20 to 50, depending on teams' appetite for risk. The common line of thinking is that James is still likely to go in the second round due to his lackluster season at USC, but at the very least, the 19-year old guard is turning heads with his performance in the draft combine.\n\nBronny James still has a ton of potential as a defense-first guard who could, perhaps, space the floor if he continues working on his jumpshot. He has good size at the guard position; listed at 6'4 and 210 lbs., he certainly has the physical tools to hound even the league's best ballhandlers. But his offensive game needs a ton of work. James shot 37/27/68 in 25 games last season, numbers that won't earn him any playing time at all at the NBA level.\n\nAt pick 17, James is simply too big of a risk for the Lakers to take on, unless they have a guarantee from LeBron that he'll re-sign if they draft his son. At pick 56, Bronny may be off the board. Plenty of difficult decisions await the Lakers. But perhaps they become more encouraged to take Bronny if they manage to snag Dan Hurley from UConn.\n\nWere the JJ Redick rumors all smoke and mirrors from the Lakers?\n\nAt what feels like the 11th hour, there is a new frontrunner for the Lakers job even though the discussion surrounding the head coaching vacancy was dominated by JJ Redick. Redick looked poised to take the job and it seemed like he was only going to finish his commentary duties for the NBA Finals before he officially began his coaching career.\n\nDan Hurley can still decline the Lakers' offer and remain with UConn, so it's not like hiring Redick is out of the question. But it's certainly a major turn of events that the Lakers have been eyeing Hurley from the start instead.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NBA-rumor-How-Bronny-James-plays-into-Lakers-targeting-Dan-Hurley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst who does a podcast with James; Hurley, the back-to-back national championship-winning coach of the Huskies; and James Borrego, the respected former Charlotte Hornets coach and ex-Gregg Popovich assistant who spent last season on New Orleans' staff.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Lakers aren't commenting publicly on the search to replace Ham.\n\nBut they sure are commenting privately.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Athletic reported that Redick shockingly was the frontrunner despite his total lack of coaching experience. On Thursday, the search took another wild turn when ESPN reported the Lakers were instead targeting Hurley, whose candidacy hadn't even been mentioned in many discussions of the job.\n\nThe crazy twists are representative of the various factions within the Lakers brain trust of owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka dispensing narratives to their favored media outlets. The Lakers previously seemed unlikely to make an official hire before the end of the NBA Finals, but the person who spoke to the AP said even that could change, depending on their progress.\n\nWhile the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics waited a week to begin the NBA Finals, the Lakers have dominated talk radio, television and message boards with speculation on the best choice to lead James and the Lakers back to contention for a second title together.\n\nThe Lakers are making their coaching change at a critical juncture for the franchise's partnership with the NBA's career scoring leader.\n\nThe 39-year-old James just completed his 21st season while playing at a higher level than anyone with that much experience in basketball history, but he has until June 29 to decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nJames could take the deal, or he could sign an even bigger new contract for more years -- or he could become a free agent for the first time in six years.\n\nWhile 31-year-old Anthony Davis is the Lakers' foundation with a long-term contract in Los Angeles, Buss and Pelinka are clearly determined to keep James alongside him for as long as possible -- even publicly floating their willingness to draft his son, Bronny, who just completed one brief collegiate season at USC.\n\nWhile agent Rich Paul has said James is not involved in the coaching search as he prepares to play for the U.S. at the Paris Olympics, the Lakers' candidates seem designed to appeal to him.\n\nJames' connection with Redick is well-known. James also recently praised Hurley on social media following a podcast interview between Redick and Hurley, with the 20-time All-Star writing that Hurley is \"so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their (offense). Love it.\"\n\nHurley has won 141 games in six seasons at UConn, rolling to the past two national titles in impressive fashion. The addition of the nation's top collegiate coach to the Lakers could be enticing to James and his son, who likely still needs extensive development to be a serviceable NBA player.\n\nThe Lakers' relative underachievement this season despite a healthy James and Davis was primarily blamed on Ham, the first-time head coach who dismayed many fans and observers with his rotations, preparation and strategic acumen. The Lakers have chased savvy basketball minds in their latest search, no matter their pedigree: Redick's encyclopedic understanding of the game has been on display in his podcast with James, while Hurley favors an NBA-friendly style of play that should translate well to the biggest basketball stage.\n\nWhoever they choose, the Lakers will be adding yet another head coach at a pace typically reserved for underachieving European soccer teams, not powerhouse NBA franchises.\n\nThe new hire will be the Lakers' eighth coach since Phil Jackson's departure in 2011 and their fourth coach since James arrived as a free agent in 2018. Frank Vogel led Los Angeles to the 2020 championship, but kept the job for only 225 games over three seasons before being fired exactly 18 months after raising the trophy in the Florida bubble.",

According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, they're ready to back up the Brinks truck with a hefty long-term contract for the back-to-back NCAA national champion.\n\nEveryone thought the job was practically JJ Redick's to lose, so Thursday's early morning revelation was a real curveball. But if you look at Hurley's sterling coaching credentials, it makes perfect sense.\n\nWojnarowski notes that Hurley has been in the Lakers' crosshairs since the get-go. Hurley has \"been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process\" thanks to his exceptional \"tactical acumen and elite player development,\" qualities that align perfectly with the legendary Lakers brand.\n\nFew candidates are as qualified for the Lakers' head coaching gig as Dan Hurley. This guy is a trailblazer -- the first men's college coach to secure back-to-back national championships since Billy Donovan achieved the feat with Florida in 2007. Hurley's career record in college, an impressive 141-58, speaks volumes. And his NCAA tournament performance? A jaw-dropping 12 consecutive double-digit wins.\n\nUConn's domination this past season, with a staggering 37-3 record and a seamless march through the NCAA tournament, is a testament to Hurley's strategic genius. His offensive schemes are intricate and precise, like a Swiss watch, creating fantastic scoring opportunities for his team. No wonder LeBron James has taken notice. According to Wojnarowski, LeBron \"has been impressed with Hurley's sophisticated offensive actions.\"\n\nHurley's knack for player development is another feather in his cap. Donovan Clingan and Stephon Castle are projected lottery picks in the upcoming draft, showcasing Hurley's ability to mold top-tier talent. This bodes well for LeBron, especially if the team decides to draft Bronny with their no. 55 pick.\n\nCoaching runs in Hurley's veins. His father was a legendary high school coach in New Jersey, amassing 26 state championships. His brother, a two-time national champion with Duke, is now coaching at Arizona State. Clearly, Hurley was born for this role.\n\nIn summary, Dan Hurley isn't just a qualified candidate; he's the perfect blend of tactical brilliance, player development prowess, and basketball heritage. The Lakers would be hitting a slam dunk by bringing him on board.\n\nIf Dan Hurley decides to take the Lakers' offer, he could face several potential challenges.\n\nFirst up is building a relationship with LeBron James. Coaching LeBron isn't a walk in the park. Tactical brilliance alone won't cut it -- remember, LeBron once tried to get Eric Spoelstra fired. Hurley would be the tenth coach in LeBron's career, a testament to the high standards and pressures involved.\n\nHurley's personality is another potential sticking point. The NBA is a players' league, vastly different from the college environment where coaches wield more authority. Hurley, who's never shied away from showing his emotions, might find this transition tricky. \"I'm a crier,\" Hurley told FOX Sports. \"I laugh, I yell, and I cry. Jim Valvano said that's a full day.\"\n\nJJ Redick was in the running for the job for different reasons. His extensive 15-year NBA career gives him an edge in understanding the grueling pace of an NBA season, something other college coaches, like John Beilein with the Cavs, have struggled with. Redick's existing relationship with LeBron was another plus.\n\nHowever, Hurley brings proven tactical expertise and a strong track record in player development, overshadowing Redick's experience in this area. While coaching in the NBA is a different ball game, Hurley's success with UConn and his ability to develop players give him a lower risk profile for the Lakers.\n\nThe bigger question is whether Hurley even wants the job. He's got a great setup at UConn, having signed a six-year, $31.5 million extension last summer. However, the timing of the Lakers' interest is perfect for Hurley. Coaching salaries have soared, with the Pistons' six-year, $78.5 million deal setting a new benchmark. Hurley could more than double his current salary with a move to the NBA.\n\nIf he does make the leap, Hurley will need to earn every penny. The Lakers' job is one of the toughest in the league, with immense scrutiny from both within and outside the organization. Just look at how Darvin Ham was criticized mid-season, or how Frank Vogel was fired two years after winning a championship.\n\nHurley's past experience suggests he's up to the challenge. It will be fascinating to see how he handles the pressure and whether he can translate his college success to the NBA stage.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billy Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beilein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Beilein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Valvano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Valvano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/safeimagekit-Dan-Hurley-1-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The fellow UConn coach revealed a prophetic message and subtle JJ Redick shade to Hurley amid the buzz.\n\n\"You know this is really funny because I happened to be at a thing with him last night. And I have no idea what's going on, where [his Lakers coaching candidacy is at]. But I just leaned over and said, 'I think you could win a lot of championships with the Lakers, more so than a guy who's never coached,\" Hurley said, via the Dan Patrick Show.\n\nIt is safe to assume the \"guy who's never coached\" is JJ Redick. But besides the subtle jab at Redick, it is crazy to think that Dan Hurley emerged as the Lakers' target one day after his alleged conversation with Geno Auriemma. Will Hurley win Los Angeles' favor over Redick and the rest of their coaching suitors?\n\nGeno Auriemma's take on Hurley holds some credence. After all, Hurley led the highly respected UConn men's basketball team to two consecutive championships. He has helped them remain a national force since joining the team during the 2018-19 season. Hurley's experience could help the Lakers achieve short and long-term success.\n\nAs for Auriemma, he wants to continue helping the UConn women's basketball team remain competitive. The Huskies nearly advanced to the 2024 NCAA Tournament final but were beaten by Caitlin Calrk and the Iowa Hawkeyes in the semifinal. Will Auriemma's Dan Hurley take become true with the Lakers?\n\nLakers have big decisions to make going into 2024-25\n\nIn mid-May, JJ Redick was deemed an early frontrunner for the Lakers' head coach search following Darvin Ham's departure.\n\nIt would be quite interesting to see JJ Redick at the helm of the Lakers. The former sharpshooter already has an important connection on the team: LeBron James. James and Redick co-host a podcast called \"Mind the Game\" where viewers can dive into their high-IQ basketball minds.\n\nSpeaking of which, if there is one thing Redick offers at an elite level, it is his knowledge of the game. Redick has over 19 years of NBA experience and was one of the best three-point shooters in the league. In addition, he has served as a sports broadcaster breaking down various basketball angles.\n\nYet, the Lakers' interest in Redick has seemingly been replaced by the prospect of hiring Dan Hurley. Hurley possesses more coaching experience than Redick, but would he be able to cultivate the same relationship Redick has with LeBron James and other players?\n\nJames will likely be a factor in Los Angeles' decision, given his status on the team. Still, the star forward's window to win another title is closing as his 22nd year in the NBA approaches. It will be interesting to see the decision the Lakers make ahead of the 2024-25 season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Auriemma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geno Auriemma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Geno-Auriemma-reveals-hilarious-Dan-Hurley-Los-Angeles-joke-amid-buzz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Nonetheless, Hurley remains the central focus of their search.\n\nThe 51-year-old coach has often spoken about his aspiration to coach in the NBA and has expressed interest in a potential partnership with the Lakers, one of basketball's most iconic teams.\n\nOne reason for the Lakers' interest in Hurley is the shifting dynamics of NBA roster construction under the new collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe limitations on acquiring multiple star players through trades have made it essential for big-market teams to maximize the development of their young talent.\n\nThe Lakers have a promising group in Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and Max Christie, who could thrive under Hurley's leadership.\n\nHurley, who has led UConn to consecutive national championships, is now one of the most coveted coaches in basketball.\n\nUnder Hurley's guidance, UConn achieved the first repeat NCAA champion in 17 years and set a record for the largest point differential in tournament history.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Van_Lith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Van Lith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cassell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Christie_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Christie (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/64984755c73895a3f877680c6f580aee/crop/0x0/2037x1358/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/07/14/16893409172940.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The court there is named after him, and he is forever a part of the university's lore as a transformative figure.\n\nA generation later, UConn coach Dan Hurley faces a similar crossroads, as ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Hurley is the target of the Lakers' coaching search. Hurley is fresh off back-to-back national titles -- Krzyzewski had gone back-to-back more than a decade before he made his decision -- and is the hottest coach in the sport.\n\nA fascinating choice awaits in a completely different era: possible collegiate immortality or the risk-reward of coaching the Lakers, which is equal parts sexy and volatile.\n\nCould the talented and impulsive Hurley rewire himself for the completely different temperament needed in the NBA? And is the college game as stable as the one Krzyzewski returned to 20 years ago?\n\nWill Hurley, 51, leave UConn in the middle of his prime and forgo the chance to chase John Wooden as the next NCAA tournament three-peat winner?\n\nWill Hurley take over the Lakers as they recalibrate in the twilight of LeBron James' career and attempt to skip the rebuild that could accompany his departure?\n\nWill Hurley look at the uncertain and disorganized moment of college basketball's nascent foray into becoming professional basketball and decide that actual professional basketball makes more sense?\n\nIt's impossible to overstate the stakes here. Hurley's decision ties the top college basketball program over the past quarter century -- UConn has won six national titles since 1999 -- with the future of the NBA's glitziest brand.\n\nWhat makes the decision for Hurley so compelling is that it's not an easy decision, as both sides have distinct pitfalls and payoffs.\n\nIf Hurley stays, he could go on to challenge Krzyzewski as the top modern coach in college basketball. Kansas' Bill Self (61) and St. John's Rick Pitino (71) are the only other current college coaches with multiple titles.\n\nPlanning the next 20 years in college, of course, comes with no certainty considering how much seismic change we've seen in the past five. Hurley would need to essentially re-recruit a new roster every year, deal with the vagaries of revenue sharing and NIL and hope the Big East can continue to swing with the two power conferences.\n\n(Hurley has not hid his disdain for the portal, summarized by this fetal position picture.)\n\nUConn doesn't have the ability to pay like the Lakers do, but it will be as fully committed as it possibly can be. The university's identity is wedded to big-time basketball. But over the next decade, when the Big East television contract is inevitably dwarfed by the SEC's and Big Ten's, could that become harder to do?\n\nNo one can safely predict what college sports will look like in 10 years, other than projecting that the football dollars of the SEC and Big Ten are going to drive those two leagues into a different financial stratosphere. No one is certain how that trickles down to hoops.\n\nAnd if there is some kind of breakaway of big-time football down the line, that's a whole other set of headaches. Ones that helped lead coaches Jay Wright, Roy Williams and Coach K to pick retirement over the collective migraines.\n\nBut Hurley's significant interest in the job indicates what's obvious to anyone who knows him -- he has the DNA of a Jersey street fighter. Sometimes that edge is his greatest strength, but in the NBA it could loom as the biggest risk in undercutting his tenure. The theater would be fascinating.\n\nThat street fighter will want him to face the challenge of going to the NBA, coaching the greatest modern player in the world and slaying the beast that is the Lakers job.\n\nBut that decision comes with the distinct risk of failure and a demand for Hurley to evolve immediately and significantly.\n\nHurley's players will tell you -- and we've had consecutive Final Four runs of testimonials -- that he brings the innate ability to be so relentlessly focused on winning and developing his players that it can be all-consuming. They balance that, of course, by saying he loves them up off the court. And no one, obviously, is going to argue with recent results.\n\nBut can Hurley rechannel that searing focus to the temperament of an NBA player? Could it work in the 82-game grind of an NBA season? The coaches aren't the stars in the NBA like they are in college. Can Hurley adjust to the whims of his players?\n\nThere's a successful path for Hurley to follow in college-to-NBA coaches such as Billy Donovan, Brad Stevens and Quin Snyder. They went to organizations that embraced the idea of running an NBA franchise like a college program, based heavily on player development and connection. The player development pedigree is there, and the tactical genius is atop college basketball right now.\n\nHurley gave one of the all-time self-evaluations during March when he summed up becoming one of the faces of college basketball this way: \"I'm basically a high school coach that's like masquerading up at this college level. I don't really care what people necessarily think of my intensity, it obviously shows up the right way with my team. We don't cheat, we don't lie. I think we're about all the right things. Just, at times, I'm an a--hole.\"\n\nWith a father, Bob, who is in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach and a brother, Bobby, who was a first-round NBA draft pick, the psychology of Hurley has always been fascinating. The flame running hot is hereditary and unflinching.\n\nBut there are two things about Hurley's self-assessed character trait that would need to unequivocally change, or his tenure would quickly become a repeat of the long line of college-to-NBA flops.\n\nThe first is Hurley would have to completely alter his sideline demeanor and his treatment of officials, as that act is completely unsustainable over the course of an NBA season.\n\nThat same intensity -- \"I am an obsessed coach,\" Hurley said in March -- that's been the North Star of a career rise from coaching in prep school has resulted in ugly and awkward interactions with officials. (Since Hurley arrived at UConn in 2018-19, the school is third in Division I with 25 technical fouls, per ESPN Stats & Information.)\n\nThe other is that he'd have to -- and it's weird to need to say this out loud -- stop interacting with and confronting fans. The site of Hurley yelling at Creighton and Providence fans postgame in the final months of the season -- it's all on YouTube -- would go from local eye roll to national roasting.\n\nIf those same interactions happen after an overtime buzzer-beater in Sacramento, it'd be a viral monster and the biggest story in sports the next day. Not just a shoulder shrug about \"Danny being Danny.\"\n\nUltimately, the choice comes down to this: Stay at a place where you are cherished, your antics are shrugged off and your legacy can echo for generations.\n\nOr you can go to the Lakers, where winning big crosses into pop culture, allows you to tango with Hollywood and compete at the highest level in a more stable league.\n\nAny risk is mitigated, of course, by the fact that some SEC or Big Ten school would embrace his failure for $10 million per year in 2026. And he could go on his merry obsessive ways, winning games and reviving his Hall of Fame track. All while expressing the same level of histrionics toward the officials.\n\nTwo decades after Krzyzewski chose Duke, another choice looms that will ripple through two billion-dollar industries.",

Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst who does a podcast with James; Hurley, the back-to-back national championship-winning coach of the Huskies; and James Borrego, the respected former Charlotte Hornets coach and ex-Gregg Popovich assistant who spent last season on New Orleans' staff.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Lakers aren't commenting publicly on the search to replace Ham.\n\nBut they sure are commenting privately.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Athletic reported that Redick shockingly was the frontrunner despite his total lack of coaching experience. On Thursday, the search took another wild turn when ESPN reported the Lakers were instead targeting Hurley, whose candidacy hadn't even been mentioned in many discussions of the job.\n\nThe crazy twists are representative of the various factions within the Lakers brain trust of owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka dispensing narratives to their favored media outlets. The Lakers previously seemed unlikely to make an official hire before the end of the NBA Finals, but the person who spoke to the AP said even that could change, depending on their progress.\n\nWhile the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics waited a week to begin the NBA Finals, the Lakers have dominated talk radio, television and message boards with speculation on the best choice to lead James and the Lakers back to contention for a second title together.\n\nThe Lakers are making their coaching change at a critical juncture for the franchise's partnership with the NBA's career scoring leader.\n\nThe 39-year-old James just completed his 21st season while playing at a higher level than anyone with that much experience in basketball history, but he has until June 29 to decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nJames could take the deal, or he could sign an even bigger new contract for more years -- or he could become a free agent for the first time in six years.\n\nWhile 31-year-old Anthony Davis is the Lakers' foundation with a long-term contract in Los Angeles, Buss and Pelinka are clearly determined to keep James alongside him for as long as possible -- even publicly floating their willingness to draft his son, Bronny, who just completed one brief collegiate season at USC.\n\nWhile agent Rich Paul has said James is not involved in the coaching search as he prepares to play for the U.S. at the Paris Olympics, the Lakers' candidates seem designed to appeal to him.\n\nJames' connection with Redick is well-known. James also recently praised Hurley on social media following a podcast interview between Redick and Hurley, with the 20-time All-Star writing that Hurley is \"so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their (offense). Love it.\"\n\nHurley has won 141 games in six seasons at UConn, rolling to the past two national titles in impressive fashion. The addition of the nation's top collegiate coach to the Lakers could be enticing to James and his son, who likely still needs extensive development to be a serviceable NBA player.\n\nThe Lakers' relative underachievement this season despite a healthy James and Davis was primarily blamed on Ham, the first-time head coach who dismayed many fans and observers with his rotations, preparation and strategic acumen. The Lakers have chased savvy basketball minds in their latest search, no matter their pedigree: Redick's encyclopedic understanding of the game has been on display in his podcast with James, while Hurley favors an NBA-friendly style of play that should translate well to the biggest basketball stage.\n\nWhoever they choose, the Lakers will be adding yet another head coach at a pace typically reserved for underachieving European soccer teams, not powerhouse NBA franchises.\n\nThe new hire will be the Lakers' eighth coach since Phil Jackson's departure in 2011 and their fourth coach since James arrived as a free agent in 2018. Frank Vogel led Los Angeles to the 2020 championship, but kept the job for only 225 games over three seasons before being fired exactly 18 months after raising the trophy in the Florida bubble.\n\nHam was the fourth coach fired by James' teams in the past eight years, joining Cleveland's David Blatt and the Lakers' Luke Walton and Vogel.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news",

him a long contract to bring Hurley to Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Lakers have had preliminary contact with Hurley, and both sides are planning to escalate discussions in the coming days,\" said Wojnarowski.\n\nHurley has a record of 141-58 in six seasons with the Huskies, winning back-to-back championships over the past two years, absolutely obliterating opponents in the process.\n\n\"Hurley's been at the forefront of the Lakers' search from the beginning of the process, even while the organization has done its due diligence interviewing other candidates,\" Woj later added.\n\nThe reports have fans losing their minds on social media.\n\n\"OMG WE JUST WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP,\" said another.\n\nSome individuals indicate this might be the end of the LeBron era in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Lebron's gonna leave they didn't hire the coach he demanded,\" said one more.\n\nOthers have joked about JJ Redick, given that just days ago reports suggested he was the top candidate for the head coaching position, thanks to his close relationship and podcast co-hosting with LeBron James.\n\nWojnarowski reports that the Lakers have had Hurley as their top guy since the start of the head coaching search, despite conflicting reports.\n\nWhether Hurley's collegiate success will translate to the NBA is still a question, but one thing is for certain: it's an entertaining

That report being that UConn coach Dan Hurley could be headed to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nOf course, Hurley is fresh off back-to-back national titles with the Huskies and just turned down a reportedly huge offer from Kentucky a couple months back. Now, it's an even bigger basketball giant, the Lakers, who are preparing to godfather offer to top coach in college hoops.\n\nWhen discussing this potential move on Get Up, host Mike Greenberg invited college sports insider Pete Thamel onto the show to explain why a jump to the NBA could be appealing for Hurley given the nature of modern collegiate athletics.\n\n\"Well, I think Dan Hurley accidentally summed this up for you Greenie,\" said Thamel. \"A couple weeks after they won the title, he tweeted out 'Portal Day 1' and it's a picture of him lying in the fetal position in his office having to deal with that.\"\n\nDespite his immense success in the current era, perhaps Hurley still doesn't love the turnstile nature of roster construction nowadays.\n\n\"I think what Dan Hurley is saying is college basketball is a year-to-year business,\" added Thamel. \"Your roster one season has very little to do with your roster the next season. I think if you walk in the average American sports bar right now and ask 'can you name five college basketball players for next year?' -- I don't think anyone can unless they're a hardcore message board fan.\"\n\nWith the decreasing amount of stars who actually return to their schools the next season, Thamel thinks coaches like Hurley have and will grow tired of keeping up on a yearly basis.\n\n\"That constant churn and constant turnover makes it challenging to do what Dan Hurley does so well -- run a program, be a program-builder -- when you have all these new starters.

He has a loaded team and is eyeing a three-peat in the college ranks.\n\nHurley, the Jersey City native and former Seton Hall guard, was targeted by Kentucky before the school eventually hired Mark Pope, but an offer from the Lakers is something entirely different.\n\n\"This for Dan Hurley has really been the ultimate mountain top, the chance to coach in the NBA,\" Woj said. \"There's no bigger stage, there's no bigger seat in coaching than the Lakers and Dan Hurley's intentions right now are to hear the Lakers out and they're going to talk more extensively here in the next few days, I'm told.\"\n\nDenver Nuggets coach Michael Malone told NJ Advance Media last month that he believes Hurley could be an excellent NBA coach.\n\n\"Do I think he could coach in the NBA? Of course, I can, he's a hell of a coach,\" Malone told NJ Advance Media in April\n\n\"There's always been [questions], 'Can a European coach coach in the NBA? Can a college coach coach in the NBA?' and you look at some of the guys that have tried and maybe it hasn't worked out. Danny played the game, he knows the game, he grew up in the gym.\"\n\nAsked if Dan Hurley would have to tone down some of his sideline antics, including his constant working of the officials, to be an NBA coach, Malone had some words of wisdom.\n\n\"Does he have to tone down?\" Malone said. \"At the end of the day, it all depends on your team and your players.\n\n\"When I got the job in Sacramento, my first head job [in the NBA] and coach [Gregg] Popovich was a big part of me getting that job, and he called me up and said, 'Listen, congratulations. This is really important. You gotta be yourself, you can't be somebody you're not. But the biggest thing is as you are yourself, you can only get away with that.'\n\n'For me being emotional-Irish, Pop being emotional-Serbian, Danny being him, you can only get away with that if you're players know that you care about them. His players at UConn know that he cares about them. Is he tough, is he demanding? Yes, he is, but he wants the best for them. And it's helped them win at a high level.\n\n\"I think if Danny Hurley got into the NBA, there's on doubt he can coach. You watch their team play. People talk about their offense, to me I was more impressed with how they defended all over the place. It was really fun to watch that finals game against Purdue and their defensive game plan.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Danny Hurley could step into the NBA and find a way to connect to his group and do a good job because Danny is a coach. He's a teacher of the game, he's a coach of the game and he's had a tremendous amount of success.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

He has the court named after him and is forever a part of the university's lore as a transformative figure.\n\nA generation later, UConn coach Dan Hurley faces a similar crossroads. He's fresh off back-to-back national titles -- Krzyzewski had gone back-to-back more than a decade before -- and is the hottest coach in the sport.\n\nA fascinating choice looms in a completely different era: collegiate immortality or the risk-reward of coaching the Lakers, which looms as equal parts sexy and volatile.\n\nCould the talented and impulsive Hurley re-wire himself for the completely different temperament needed in the NBA? And is the college game as stable as the one Krzyzewski returned to 20 years ago?\n\nWith ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reporting that Hurley is the target of the Lakers coaching search, a generationally impactful decision again looms over two sports. Will the hottest coach in college basketball leave for the NBA's most iconic coaching job?\n\nWill Hurley, 51, leave UConn in the middle of his prime and forgo the chance to chase John Wooden as the next NCAA tournament three-peat winner?\n\nWill Hurley take over the Lakers as they recalibrate in the twilight of LeBron James' career and attempt to skip the rebuild that could accompany his departure?\n\nWill Hurley look at the uncertain and disorganized moment of college basketball's nascent foray into becoming professional basketball and decide that actual professional basketball makes more sense?\n\nIt's impossible to overstate the stakes here. Hurley's decision ties the top college basketball program over the last quarter century -- UConn has won six national titles since 1999 -- with the future of the NBA's glitziest brand.\n\nWhat makes the decision for Hurley so compelling is that it's not an easy decision, as both sides have distinct pitfalls and payoffs.\n\nIf Hurley stays, he could go on and challenge Krzyzewski as the top modern coach in college basketball. Kansas' Bill Self (61) and St. John's Rick Pitino (71) are the only other current college coaches with multiple titles.\n\nPlanning the next 20 years in college, of course, comes with no certainty considering how much seismic change we've seen in the last five. Hurley would need to essentially re-recruit a new roster every year, deal with the vagaries of revenue share and NIL and hope the Big East can continue to swing with the two power conferences.\n\n(Hurley has not hid his disdain for the portal, summarized by this fetal position picture.)\n\nUConn doesn't have the ability to pay like the Lakers do, but it will be as fully committed as it possibly can be. The university's identity is wedded to big-time basketball, but at some point over the next decade with the Big East television contract inevitably dwarfed by the SEC and Big Ten, could that become harder to do?\n\nNo one can safely predict what college sports will look like in 10 years, other than projecting that the football dollars of the SEC and Big Ten are going to drive those two leagues further into a different financial stratosphere. No one is certain how that trickles to hoops.\n\nAnd if there's some kind of breakaway of big-time football down the line, that's a whole other set of headaches. Ones that helped lead Jay Wright, Roy Williams and Coach K to pick retirement over the collective migraines.\n\nBut Hurley's significant interest in the job indicates what's obvious to anyone who knows him -- he's got the DNA of a Jersey street fighter. Sometimes that edge is his greatest strength, but in the NBA it could loom as the biggest risk in undercutting his tenure. The theater would be fascinating.\n\nThat streetfighter will want him to face the challenge of going to the NBA, coaching the greatest modern player in the world and slaying the beast that is the Lakers job.\n\nBut that decision comes with the distinct risk of failure and a demand for Hurley to evolve immediately and significantly.\n\nHurley's players will tell you -- and we've had consecutive Final Four runs of testimonials -- that he brings the innate ability to be so relentlessly focused on winning and developing his players that it can be all consuming. They balance that, of course, by saying he loves them up off the court. And no one, obviously, is going to argue with recent results.\n\nBut can Hurley re-channel that searing focus to the temperament of an NBA player? Could it work in the 82-game grind of an NBA season? The coaches aren't the stars in the NBA like they are in college. Can Hurley adjust to the whims of his players?\n\nThere's a path for Hurley to follow the successful path of college-to-NBA coaches like Billy Donovan, Brad Stevens and Quin Snyder. They went to organizations that embraced the idea of running an NBA franchise like a college program, based heavily on player development and connection. The player development pedigree is there, and the tactical genius is atop college basketball right now.\n\nHurley gave one of the all-time self-evaluations during March when he summed up becoming one of the faces of college basketball this way: \"I'm basically a high school coach that's like masquerading up at this college level. I don't really care what people necessarily think of my intensity, it obviously shows up the right way with my team. We don't cheat, we don't lie. I think we're about all the right things. Just, at times, I'm an a--hole.\"\n\nWith a father, Bob, who is in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach and a brother, Bobby, who was a first-round NBA draft pick, the psychology of Hurley has always been fascinating. The flame running hot is hereditary and unflinching.\n\nBut there are two things about Hurley's self-assessed character trait that would need to unequivocally change, or his tenure would quickly become a repeat of the long line of college-to-NBA flops.\n\nThe first is Hurley would have to completely alter his sideline demeanor and his treatment of officials, as that act is completely unsustainable over the course of an NBA season.\n\nThat same intensity -- \"I am an obsessed coach,\" Hurley said in March -- that's been the north star of a career rise from coaching in prep school has resulted in ugly and awkward interactions with officials. (Since Hurley arrived at UConn in 2018-19, the school is third in Division I with 25 technical fouls, per ESPN Stats & Info.)\n\nThe other is that he'd have to -- and it's weird to need to say this out loud -- stop interacting with and confronting fans. The site of Hurley yelling at Creighton and Providence fans postgame in the final months of the season -- it's all on YouTube -- would go from local eye roll to national roasting.\n\nIf those same interactions happen after an overtime buzzer beater in Sacramento, it'd be a viral monster and the biggest story in sports the next day. Not just a shoulder shrug about \"Danny being Danny.\"\n\nUltimately, the choice comes down to this: Stay at a place where you are cherished, your antics are shrugged off and your legacy can echo for generations.\n\nOr you can go to the Lakers, where winning big crosses into pop culture, allows you to tango with Hollywood and compete at the highest level in a more stable league.\n\nAny risk is mitigated, of course, by the fact that some SEC or Big Ten school would embrace his failure for $10 million per year in 2026. And he could go on his merry obsessive ways, winning games and reviving his Hall of Fame track. All while expressing the same level of histrionics toward the officials.\n\nTwo decades after Krzyzewski's chose Duke, another choice looms that will ripple through two billion-dollar industries.",

Such a move would be a seismic one, particularly in the college game, where Hurley has built a budding dynasty at UConn and has rapidly entered the conversation for being the best coach in college basketball.\n\nHere's how such a move would impact UConn and what to look out for in the coming days should Hurley head to the NBA.\n\nThe beauty of the UConn job is very much in the eye of the beholder. On fundamentals alone, the job is less attractive than other blue bloods, given its location and the lack of big-time football money flowing through it, along with the subsequent long-term conference affiliation questions that come with that. Despite that, no program has had more success in the 2000s than UConn, winning national championships under three different coaches (two each by Hurley and Jim Calhoun, one by Kevin Ollie). The expectations for whoever would come next are national championships, plural. That's a daunting task, especially given a potentially bearish financial future compared to the program's peers in leagues with eight- and nine-figure annual television payouts coming soon.\n\nThe job opening in early June also presents problems. Wooing top coaches who've already built rosters for next season would be tricky and potentially complicated further by recent contract extensions that have ballooned buyouts into the $10 million or more range. A coach from outside the UConn family would also have his hands full retaining the current roster, a priority given UConn's legitimate aspirations for a three-peat.\n\nThat makes an internal promotion perhaps the most realistic option, either on an interim basis for a year or on a full-time basis. UConn has two strong candidates on its current staff in associate head coach Kimani Young and assistant coach Luke Murray. The perceived favorite would be Young, who took over coaching duties when Hurley was ejected in a famous 2022 game against the Villanova Wildcats and owns the top title on staff. Young has long been due for a head coaching opportunity and has been openly praised by Hurley several times for his work both in game-planning and recruiting.\n\nMurray, an X-and-O savant and the son of actor Bill Murray, could also emerge as a potential candidate. If not tabbed the head coach, Hurley seems likely to push for him to join his Lakers staff.\n\nIf a full search were opened up, it'd be fascinating to see which candidates emerge. Rutgers's Steve Pikiell was on the board when Hurley took the job and he played and coached under Calhoun, but has his most talented team yet set to enroll at Rutgers this summer. Another regionally tied name that could make sense is Seton Hall's Shaheen Holloway, who went to an Elite Eight as the head coach at St. Peter's. Athletic director David Benedict could also take big swings at the likes of Auburn's Bruce Pearl (a Massachusetts native) and Alabama's Nate Oats (who previously worked in New York at Buffalo), but neither seems likely to land.\n\nIf Hurley leaves, every player on the Huskies would have a 30-day window to enter the transfer portal despite the portal being otherwise closed since May 1. Hurley rebuilt the Huskies' roster this spring to have a chance to contend for a three-peat, reeling in highly regarded transfers Aidan Mahaney and Tarris Reed Jr., five-star freshman Liam McNeeley and retaining star forward Alex Karaban. A swift internal hire could help retain the current roster, though it isn't a guarantee. Even with an internal hire made for 2023-24 after Bob Huggins was fired at West Virginia last June, five players entered the portal, with three eventually leaving.\n\nGiven the way prices in the NIL market have exploded for top transfers as supply has shrunk in the last month, it's safe to say there would be hugely lucrative offers on the table to try to woo UConn's current roster into the portal. How Benedict handles this search could be the difference between the Huskies being deep in contention for a third straight championship and facing a near-impossible rebuild in June after a significant roster exodus.\n\nIn an era of significant turnover among the sport's legendary coaches, Hurley had emerged as one of the new faces of the game. His fiery personality and ever-quotable news conferences, combined with the remarkable success of the last two years, gave Hurley the chance to take over the sport and become this generation's John Wooden or Mike Krzyzewski. To lose Hurley to the NBA would be a brutal break for a sport hunting for star power for fans to attach themselves to.\n\nPlus, UConn going for a historic third straight title would be one of the biggest stories of the 2024-25 season. That pursuit being derailed in June by a coaching search would be a crippling blow months before the season tips off.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"},

But taking another NCAA gig would cost Hurley -- or his new employer -- significantly more.\n\nHurley last year signed a six-year, $32.1 million employment contract that runs through March of 2029. The deal, a copy of which was obtained by Sportico via records request, includes two parallel payment structures should he leave early: one for NBA jobs, and one for other D1 college jobs. In contrast to the $1.875 million owed if he goes to an NBA team, Hurley would owe UConn $7.5 million if he left the school tomorrow for another NCAA gig.\n\nWriting these buyouts into coaches' contracts is a common way that schools protect themselves from in-demand coaches raising their profiles and leaving for other opportunities. Hurley has coached the Huskies for the past six years, leading UConn to four NCAA tournaments and back-to-back national championships in 2023 and 2024.\n\nHowever, it's rare for the buyouts to distinguish between college and NBA jobs. (Hurley's previous UConn contract made no such distinction.) These fees are often paid by the team doing the hiring and are another part of the calculus of landing their desired candidate. When UConn hired Hurley in 2018, for example, the school paid his $1 million buyout at Rhode Island, while also including language in his contract which said the school would also neutralize any tax obligations associated with the payment.\n\nThe Lakers are \"targeting\" Hurley as their next coach, ESPN reported Thursday morning. The story says the NBA team, whose roster includes LeBron James, is \"preparing a massive, long-term contract offer,\" though it did not provide any specifics. The highest-paid coaches in the NBA make more than $10 million, according to Sportico's calculations, a bit more than Kansas's Bill Self, the top-paid coach in college. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich leads the way at $16 million, followed by Monty Williams of the Detroit Pistons at $13.1 million.\n\nHurley's contract -- which he signed last June, after his first NCAA title but before his second -- paid him about $4.9 million this past year, including a $500,000 retention bonus paid in November. That doesn't include a $500,000 bonus for winning the national title and a handful of other performance bonuses.\n\nESPN said the Lakers have already made preliminary contact with Hurley. A representative for the Lakers didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. An email sent to Hurley's UConn address wasn't returned.\n\nEarlier this year, Hurley was asked about the possibility of his leaving UConn. He joked that he wouldn't ask his wife, a New Jersey native, to relocate. He then added that he was focused on winning a third straight national title. \"I mean, we just went to Rhode Island, which I had to drag her to, and then to Connecticut,\" he said, according to ESPN. \"I got her closer [to New Jersey]. And now further? I can't afford a divorce right now, too. I just started making money.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eben_novy_williams@sportico.com", "name": "Eben Novy-Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_College_Coach_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith College Coach of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Self", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Self"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2147667240-e1717678129679.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

In April, Hurley touted Young and assistant Luke Murray as deserving candidates for a prominent head-coaching job.\n\n\"It would have to be the best mid-major job in the country for those guys to leave,\" Hurley said. \"We've got the resources to be able to take care of them. I don't know how you're at the best mid-major program in the country, or a high major, and not wanting your program to look like our program.\"\n\nGiven the school's massive success behind Hurley's staff, an internal replacement would make sense if the Lakers rumors become a reality.

UConn has won back-to-back NCAA tournaments under Hurley over the last two seasons. The Lakers are looking for a coach to replace Darvin Ham after getting eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets this spring.\n\nFormer Duke and NBA player J.J. Redick had been seen as the frontrunner for the Lakers job in recent days. But the Lakers are reportedly preparing to offer Hurley a \"massive\" contract for him to come to the NBA.\n\nHurley, 51, would take over a team that's looking for one more push to the Finals with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. After winning the 2020 NBA Finals, the Lakers have lost twice in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in 2022. In Ham's first season in 2022-23, the Lakers got the No. 7 seed and advanced to the Western Conference Finals before getting swept by the Nuggets.\n\nJames, who turns 40 in December, has a player option on his contract for the 2024-25 season that needs to be picked up by June 29. On the assumption that it's picked up -- there are no signs he will not -- James and Davis will make a combined $90 million next season.\n\nThere's limited financial and roster flexibility for the Lakers beyond James and Davis too. The team does have its 2024 first-round pick at No. 17 after the Pelicans opted to gamble on the Lakers' roster and take the team's 2025 first-round pick earlier this summer as part of the deal for Davis. With that pick, the team's 2029 first-round pick and other players on the roster, Los Angeles could be in the market to upgrade for a No. 3 player alongside its star duo.\n\nHowever, a move for another top-tier player could significantly hurt the team's depth and force the Lakers to rely on minimum-salary players for a large portion of the roster. Just ask the Phoenix Suns how that went this season. The Suns were bounced in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first season with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal all on the same team.\n\nHurley is 292-163 as a college coach\n\nHurley has won nearly 300 games across 14 seasons as a head coach at the top level of men's college basketball. After two seasons at Wagner, Hurley took over at Rhode Island. He turned the Rams into a 23-win team in his third season after Rhode Island went 8-21 in year one.\n\nAfter taking the Rams to back-to-back NCAA tournaments in 2017 and 2018, Hurley was hired at UConn. The Huskies were a mess when he was brought in. UConn had finished under .500 in each of the past two seasons and had made just one NCAA tournament appearance since winning the national title in 2014.\n\nUConn was 16-17 in Hurley's first season before winning 19 games in year two before the COVID-19 pandemic prematurely ended the college basketball season. Since then, UConn has made the NCAA tournament four straight times and UConn has become the prominent program in men's college basketball.\n\nThe Huskies have obliterated their opponents in each of the past two NCAA tournaments. In 2023, UConn beat every team it played in the tournament by at least 13 points on the way to a national title win over San Diego State.\n\nThe recent history of college coaches heading to the NBA\n\nUConn was even better in 2023-24. The Huskies lost just three games all season and beat their NCAA tournament opponents by even more. UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 14 points. The Huskies beat Alabama 86-72 in the Final Four before beating Purdue 75-60 in the national title game.\n\nIf Hurley heads to the NBA, he would be the first NCAA tournament-winning coach to go from the college ranks to the NBA since Billy Donovan left Florida for the Oklahoma City Thunder after the 2014-15 college basketball season. Florida won back-to-back national titles in 2006 and 2007 under Donovan and made the Final Four in 2014.\n\nDonovan is still in the league with the Chicago Bulls, though Chicago hasn't been past the first round of the playoffs in his four years with the team. And he's a relative outlier among coaches who have made the leap in both success and tenure.\n\nThe same year Donovan was hired by the Thunder, the Bulls hired Fred Hoiberg from Iowa State. The Bulls were 40 games under .500 in three-plus seasons under Hoiberg and he's now the coach at Nebraska.\n\nSince Donovan and Hoiberg, just one college coach has been hired by an NBA team. The Cleveland Cavaliers hired Michigan's John Beilein in 2019, but he lasted just 54 games as the team's head coach. Cleveland went 14-40 in his short time with the team.\n\nOutside of Donovan, the most successful NBA coach to make the leap from the college ranks in modern history is Boston Celtics executive Brad Stevens. After back-to-back Final Fours at Butler in 2010 and 2011, Stevens was hired by the Boston Celtics as the team's head coach in 2013.\n\nOver eight seasons with the Celtics, Stevens was 354-282 as a head coach and Boston twice won more than 50 games in that span. He moved into the front office after the 2020-21 season and is currently the Celtics' president of basketball operations.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

Obviously, we spoiled ourselves and we've spoiled our fans with how well we've played and the run we're on, but I do think we believe as an organization that we can continue to stay where we are in terms of going into each year and feeling you have a team that can compete for the championship.\"\n\nInside Alex Karaban's decision to return to UConn and how the Huskies' roster fits around him\n\nHurley has led the Huskies to the fifth and sixth national championships in program history. This past season, UConn finished 37-3, winning the Big East regular season and conference tournament titles, then rolled through the NCAA Tournament, winning every game by double digits for the second year in a row.\n\nFour of five starters are leaving, with Donovan Clingan, Stephon Castle, Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer heading for the pros. Alex Karaban announced last week he would return, joining Hassan Diarra and Samson Johnson to form the core of next year's team, alongside sophomores Jaylin Stewart, Jayden Ross, Youssef Singare and Solomon Ball, transfers Tarris Reed Jr. and Aidan Mahaney and freshmen Liam McNeely, Isaiah Abraham and Ahmad Nowell.\n\nDom Amore: How Jim Penders pushed the right buttons to get UConn baseball to another Super Regional\n\nExcept for Karaban, who is expected soon, all are back on campus.\n\n\"We've been out there twice, minus A.K., who has earned a couple of off days because his season never really ended,\" Hurley said. \"He'll be back (Wednesday) and we'll get our first look at the group, I'll start formulating.\"\n\nHurley and his staff have also been out recruiting, targeting elite players.

If that happens, James gets a chance to play with his son and the benefit of Hurley and his staff becoming responsible for Bronny's pro development.\"\n\nJames authored a response to a social media post from JJ Redick in April, in which the four-time NBA champion offered effusive praise for Hurley and his assistants.\n\nThat James' praise for Hurley came on one of Redick's social media posts adds a layer of intrigue to the Lakers' decision to target the UCONN coach so aggressively for their open position.\n\nThat is, in part, because James is not just a co-host with Redick on the duo's \"Mind The Game\" podcast that launched in March 2024, but because Redick was among the frontrunners for the Lakers job prior to Wojnarowksi's reporting on Thursday morning.\n\nAs of Thursday, James had not publicly voiced his support for Redick, though Shams Charania of The Athletic reported on Tuesday that Redick was the leader in the clubhouse when it came to Los Angeles' next hire.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers are zeroing in on JJ Redick as the front-runner to be the franchise's next head coach, league and media industry sources told The Athletic,\" Charania wrote on June 4.\n\nHurley has never been an NBA head coach, though he does have 14 years of head coaching experience at the collegiate level.\n\nHe started with Wagner in the Northeast Conference 2010-11, remaining there for two years before leaving for Rhode Island and the Atlantic 10 Conference.

UConn women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma fits that billing to a T. Geno doesn't need to keep coaching. He doesn't need to be pouring his heart out at the podium after losing to Caitlin Clark. The man has led the Huskies to eleven national championships. Twenty-three Final Four appearances. He just turned 70 in March.\n\nAnd yet, bless him, here Geno is: Signing a five-year extension at UConn and giving us some headline-worthy soundbites rather than going gently into the sunset of retirement. On the latter account, Auriemma voiced his full-throated support for UConn men's coach Dan Hurley, who the Los Angeles Lakers are circling as their next potential hire. In this all-time great coach's eyes, Hurley is the man for the Purple and Gold gig, and a clear cut above reported finalist/NBA veteran/prolific podcaster/ESPN personality JJ Redick.\n\nDoes some of this stem from Redick being the ultimate Duke villain in college, and that the Blue Devils and Huskies -- who have admittedly far bigger rivalries than each other -- have traded blows on big college hoops stages over the years? Perhaps. Nevertheless, it's equal parts cool to see Auriemma backing Hurley with such fervor and intriguing/a bit petty to shade Redick's credentials (or lack thereof).\n\nSure feels like a bit of a cheap shot at JJ. Mind you, not as extreme as one from Chennedy Carter, but a cheap shot all the same. Geno could've gassed up Hurley until the cows came home without blatantly insulting another prospective candidate. But he went there.\n\nRedick has been known to clap back at some of his detractors on social media. No response as of yet. Then again, I'll bet JJ might lay low on that front for a while with the Lakers' job hanging in the balance. The fact that Redick does a podcast with LeBron is fascinating -- as is the fact that he had Hurley on his own pod, with The King giving Hurley a ringing endorsement for one particular clip:\n\nThe plot thickens.\n\nSpeaking of the plot thickening, we have another sensational scoop battle going on between Woj and Shams. The former came out firing this morning about Hurley being the front-runner for the Lakers' gig, whereas Shams has reported all along that Redick, along with James Borrego, was a leader in the clubhouse.\n\nJust as Auriemma and Hurley are relentless in their pursuit of championships, Woj and Shams are dynastic NBA insiders with a shared history and no end in sight as to when they'll cease \"I WAS FIRST\" face-offs for the biggest basketball news.\n\nWe'll all find out together soon whether Hurley, Redick, or another dark-horse candidate emerges with one of the most high-profile coaching jobs in all of sports. With Hurley coming off back-to-back national titles at UConn, it'd be quite a stunner to see him bolt for the NBA. Not every day the Lakers job is open, though -- and in addition to getting to coach LeBron in the twilight of his career, Hurley could really make his mark on the iconic franchise and on basketball history with a rebuild/reload project even when The King is finished playing.\n\nHuskies players are reportedly in the loop.

Sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that Los Angeles is preparing a massive, long-term contract offer to pry two-time NCAA champion Dan Hurley away from the University of Connecticut. What would such a monumental hire mean for the Lakers -- and the future of superstar LeBron James, who can become a free agent this summer? Our NBA and college basketball experts break down what we know and what could happen in the coming days and weeks.\n\nIt's an audacious and creative option that reflects where college basketball is in the NIL era, where the NBA is with its new collective bargaining agreement and where the Lakers are after churning through coaches over the last decade (they haven't had a coach last more than three seasons since Phil Jackson). There isn't a perfect choice, but this one would represent a high risk/high reward option with a coach with unquestioned talent.\n\nThe other candidates, one of whom might still get the job, as Hurley is not a done deal, represent some of these qualities. J.J. Redick has shown great innovation and depth in X and Os and has credibility with players. James Borrego has the most experience and has proven to be effective at this level. Sam Cassell is beloved as an assistant, has bonding with stars, and has a championship resume. Hurley's profile is different, but his star has never been higher.\n\n-- Brian Windhorst\n\nOver the past few years, Hurley has established himself as one of the elite player development coaches and tactical minds in college basketball. After his first national championship with UConn, he had two players selected in the 2023 NBA draft -- including lottery pick Jordan Hawkins, who saw dramatic improvement from Year One to Year Two under Hurley. This year, he had five players invited to the NBA draft combine and could have the first two college players picked in Donovan Clingan and Stephon Castle -- neither of whom were in this position when they arrived in Storrs.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, he's developed arguably the best offense in college basketball, predicated on off-ball movement and 3-point shooting. It's a stark change from his offenses at Rhode Island and his early days at UConn, and represents an ability to adapt his Xs and Os to the modern game. The offensive principles he's utilized also translate well to the NBA.\n\nThe biggest question about Hurley's coaching style comes from an emotional standpoint. He's notorious for his sideline histrionics toward referees -- and opposing crowds, at times -- and his practices are incredibly loud, intense and filled with their fair share of choice words. Hurley's intensity has translated to plenty of success at the high school and college levels and would be difficult to completely change at 51 years old, but he might have to dial it back for the NBA.\n\n-- Jeff Borzello\n\nFor starters, it would mean his fourth coach in seven years with the Lakers, after playing for five different coaches over his first 15 years in the league. And it would mean his second consecutive coach, after Darvin Ham, to coach him with zero NBA head coaching experience on his resume.\n\nJames has already endorsed Hurley's acumen, posting on X -- ironically under a video of Redick interviewing Hurley -- that the Connecticut coach is \"so DAMN GOOD\" and \"super creative\" with his offensive schemes. Matching wits with James' basketball mind has always been the key to a good partnership and is something James values as much if not more as a coach's organizational skills and demeanor.\n\nOf course, the idea of Hurley's fiery demeanor translating from a 40-game collegiate season coaching teenagers to an 82-game NBA slate, holding a superstar like James accountable, remains a question mark. However, sources close to James have told ESPN in the past that while it might not always seem that way, James likes being coached hard and responds well to being held to a task on the floor - even as he nears 40 years old.\n\n-- Dave McMenamin\n\nThe roster the Lakers have now, as Hurley is interviewing for the job, could look far different than the one he would possibly coach in October.\n\nAll-Star Anthony Davis is under contract and all signs point to James returning (he has until June 29 to exercise his $51.4 million player option). But there are questions about the rest of the roster beyond the two franchise players, starting with D'Angelo Russell's $18.9 million player option.\n\nIf Russell opts in to his contract for next season, Los Angeles is not only a luxury tax team once again, but will exceed the first apron. If the Lakers re-sign restricted free agent Max Christie, they would then enter the restrictive second apron. A team over the first apron is not allowed to take back more money in a trade, while a second apron team cannot aggregate contracts or send out cash in a trade, and doesn't have access to the $5.1 million taxpayer midlevel exception.\n\nA scenario in which Russell does not return opens up more flexibility, including access to the $12.9 million midlevel exception and more wiggle room to acquire a player in a trade. However, it would also leave the Lakers with a void at point guard.\n\nThe Lakers will also need to evaluate if searching for a third star to put alongside James and Davis is the best direction under the new CBA. The Lakers have three first-round picks (2024, 2029 and 2031) to trade, but a more prudent use of them would be to copy how the Dallas Mavericks have utilized their draft assets. In three separate trades, the Mavericks acquired Kyrie Irving, P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford, all key contributors to their NBA Finals team. The cost? Three first-round picks.\n\n-- Bobby Marks\n\nObviously, it's too early to predict how much influence Hurley might have over the Lakers' approach to the draft, with L.A.'s front office in the midst of preparations irrespective of this hire.\n\nWhether the Lakers target Bronny James, a projected second-rounder, might not be Hurley's call, and I don't think there's a direct implication one way or the other as to their immediate strategy in cultivating the fringes of their roster. The Lakers will presumably target a more NBA-ready rookie with the 17th pick if they keep it, leaving the door open for them to take a longer-term prospect in the second round at No. 55.\n\nMore importantly, a major impetus behind the Lakers targeting Hurley with a significant long-term offer is his strong history of player development, something that holds value to the organization not only in the moment, but also as it prepares for the eventuality of a post-LeBron future.\n\nDuring this back-to-back title run, Hurley and his UConn staff did an excellent job of identifying undervalued talent on the recruiting trail and developing them into NBA prospects. Clingan and Castle will come off the draft board early in a few weeks. Others such as Cam Spencer and Alex Karaban (who's headed back to UConn) benefited strongly from the program. It follows that if the Lakers ultimately decide to target Bronny James, the Hurley hire is one that could enhance his chances of becoming a player that sticks in the league long-term.", "source":

A team over the first apron is not allowed to take back more money in a trade, while a second apron team cannot aggregate contracts or send out cash in a trade, and doesn't have access to the $5.1 million taxpayer midlevel exception.\n\nA scenario in which Russell does not return opens up more flexibility, including access to the $12.9 million midlevel exception and more wiggle room to acquire a player in a trade. However, it would also leave the Lakers with a void at point guard.\n\nThe Lakers will also need to evaluate if searching for a third star to put alongside James and Davis is the best direction under the new CBA. The Lakers have three first-round picks (2024, 2029 and 2031) to trade, but a more prudent use of them would be to copy how the Dallas Mavericks have utilized their draft assets. In three separate trades, the Mavericks acquired Kyrie Irving, P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford, all key contributors to their NBA Finals team. The cost? Three first-round picks.\n\n-- Bobby Marks\n\nObviously, it's too early to predict how much influence Hurley might have over the Lakers' approach to the draft, with L.A.'s front office in the midst of preparations irrespective of this hire.\n\nWhether the Lakers target Bronny James, a projected second-rounder, might not be Hurley's call, and I don't think there's a direct implication one way or the other as to their immediate strategy in cultivating the fringes of their roster. The Lakers will presumably target a more NBA-ready rookie with the 17th pick if they keep it, leaving the door open for them to take a longer-term prospect in the second round at No. 55.\n\nMore importantly, a major impetus behind the Lakers targeting Hurley with a significant long-term offer is his strong history of player development, something that holds value to the organization not only in the moment, but also as it prepares for the eventuality of a post-LeBron future.\n\nDuring this back-to-back title run, Hurley and his UConn staff did an excellent job of identifying undervalued talent on the recruiting trail and developing them into NBA prospects. Clingan and Castle will come off the draft board early in a few weeks. Others such as Cam Spencer and Alex Karaban (who's headed back to UConn) benefited strongly from the program. It follows that if the Lakers ultimately decide to target Bronny James, the Hurley hire is one that could enhance his chances of becoming a player who sticks in the league long-term.", "source":

The doomsayers could have a point this time.\n\nFor the past few years, the doomsayers have viewed various major coaching changes as a sign of The End Times in college athletics. The tumultuous state of things -- namely NIL and transfer chaos -- was driving great minds away, they said.\n\nBut there likely were more simple explanations, like age or job security. Mike Krzyzewski, Nick Saban, Roy Williams, Jim Boeheim and Tara VanDerveer all were in their 70s upon retirement. Even Jay Wright had rolled the odometer over to 60. Chip Kelly leaving the UCLA Bruins to become an assistant with the Ohio State Buckeyes or Jeff Hafley bolting from the Boston College Eagles for a coordinator position in the NFL could be considered beat-the-posse moves. Jim Harbaugh, who already had great success in the NFL, was beating a different kind of posse back to the pros.\n\nHurley is a different deal. This one sets off some sirens.\n\nThe two-time defending national champion men's basketball coach of the Connecticut Huskies is, according to ESPN, in talks with the Los Angeles Lakers about their vacant job. The offer was described by Adrian Wojnarowski as \"massive.\" To be clear, every coach at every level of basketball will listen if the Lakers call and make a massive offer. Krzyzewski did at least once, in 2004. Rick Pitino went down the road with the franchise a decade before that.\n\nPerhaps Hurley will do what those two did -- assess the situation and decide to stay put in a powerhouse college job. But if he leaves to follow a path littered with failure, it could be a sign of a college coaching star who is disillusioned. The current rules and a conference landscape that continues to tilt toward consolidated football power are not Hurley-friendly dynamics.\n\nHe is 51 years old and at the height of his powers, set up to dominate at UConn for as long as he chooses to do so. If he enjoys it enough.\n\nFour days after becoming the first back-to-back men's champ in 17 years, Hurley posted a picture on X of himself lying on the floor in the UConn basketball offices with his arm covering his face. \"Day 1 in the portal ...\" Hurley wrote.\n\nKeep in mind that Hurley is a world-class smart alec, a guy with an acerbic sense of humor. But he's also consistently lamented the chronic impermanence of the college landscape, with players now given the latitude to transfer every year if they see fit.\n\n\"I just don't think it's healthy for somebody to be able to change schools like underwear,\" Hurley said during the NCAA tournament run.\n\nThat doesn't mean Hurley was opposed to taking transfers -- he wouldn't have won those titles without grabbing Tristen Newton from the East Carolina Pirates and Cam Spencer after stops with the Loyola Maryland Greyhounds and the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. He also signed some big-time transfers for the 2024-25 year. Hurley has played the game, and played it well.\n\nBut as the son of a legendary high school coach, and a guy whose own coaching career started at the prep level, he is an exceptional modern coach with an old-school soul. He's dominating college basketball but not necessarily in love with how it works.\n\nThe Big East is a great basketball league in a football world, with market forces continuing to exert pressure on everyone who isn't in the Big Ten or Southeastern Conference. UConn, in theory, should be able to thrive in perpetuity as a basketball entity, but it also could watch the Alabamas of the world use their football cash to take over in hoops as well. And the added financial strain of the looming House v. NCAA settlement could fall particularly heavily on schools with modest football revenue like UConn.\n\nAnd if player movement remains what it is, the annual spring sprint to flesh out a roster takes its toll. Especially if your team has played deep into the Big Dance. Hurley barely had time to savor the title before diving into a market he doesn't enjoy.\n\n\"There's a lot of positive things about being able to get a change of scenery,\" Hurley said of the transfer scene. \"You just hope it doesn't create an environment where young people just run from fixing themselves, which is usually the issue.\"\n\nHurley likely would have to fix himself some to survive in the pro ranks, and in Los Angeles. He is an East Coast lifer, never working west of New Jersey. And just because he's a fan of meditation and scented candles, that doesn't mean he possesses SoCal zen.\n\nHe is famously intense, with a volatile sideline demeanor that is completely foreign to the present-day NBA. Getting into it with fans in the front row is probably not a good career move at that level.\n\nThen there is the losing. Even the successful teams experience defeat regularly in the NBA -- the Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks were 50-32 in the regular season -- and losing is death to Hurley. Consider his description of losing a preseason scrimmage to Virginia in October: \"I was seething. That was our first real live game. Just to get beat up like that in the second half of that scrimmage was jarring because when you play bad and lose, no matter how good you are, you don't ever think you're going to win again.\"\n\nMaybe Hurley would win in the NBA at a similar rate to what he's done in college. But he also would be the extreme outlier if he does. A lot of great college coaches have crashed and burned at the pro level.\n\nThe most successful over the past 25 years was Brad Stevens, who took the Celtics to the Eastern Conference finals three times. But he never made the NBA Finals and never won a title.\n\nBilly Donovan made the Western Conference finals at Oklahoma City his first year in the NBA, in 2016. He hasn't won a playoff series since and has missed the playoffs three out of four years with the Bulls.\n\nPitino, John Calipari, John Beilein, Lon Kruger, Fred Hoiberg, Leonard Hamilton, Mike Montgomery -- they all took over struggling franchises and kept on struggling. Five of them returned to college and began winning again.\n\nHurley could certainly do the same thing. He could try the Lakers and see how it goes. If he wins a title, he moves into his own realm of greatness. If he loses and gets fired, well, he would immediately return to being the hottest name on the college market.\n\nBut he might also be done with the college game as it is presently constructed and (de)regulated. The college sports industry is rife with self-loathing and hysterical overreactions declaring everything to be a mess. But if college basketball loses Dan Hurley, that could be a legitimately bad sign.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

UConn has won back-to-back NCAA titles under Hurley over the last two seasons. The Lakers are looking for a coach to replace Darvin Ham after getting eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets this spring.\n\nFormer Duke and NBA player J.J. Redick had been seen as the frontrunner for the Lakers job in recent days. But the Lakers are reportedly preparing to offer Hurley a \"massive\" contract for him to come to the NBA.\n\nHurley, 51, would take over a team that's looking for one more push to the Finals with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. After winning the 2020 NBA Finals, the Lakers have lost twice in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in 2022. In Ham's first season in 2022-23, the Lakers got the No. 7 seed and advanced to the Western Conference finals before getting swept by the Nuggets.\n\nJames, who turns 40 in December, has a player option on his contract for the 2024-25 season that needs to be picked up by June 29. On the assumption that it's picked up, James and Davis will make a combined $90 million next season. But James could also opt out and negotiate a new deal with the Lakers.\n\nThere's limited financial and roster flexibility for the Lakers beyond James and Davis too. The team does have its 2024 first-round pick at No. 17 after the Pelicans opted to gamble on the Lakers' roster and take L.A.'s 2025 first-round pick as part of the deal for Davis. With that pick, the team's 2029 first-round pick and other players on the roster, Los Angeles could be in the market to upgrade for a No. 3 player alongside its star duo.\n\nHowever, a move for another top-tier player could significantly hurt the team's depth and force the Lakers to rely on minimum-salary players for a large portion of the roster. Just ask the Phoenix Suns how that went this season. The Suns were bounced in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves in their first season with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal all on the same team.\n\nHurley has won nearly 300 games across 14 seasons as a head coach at the top level of men's college basketball. After two seasons at Wagner, Hurley took over at Rhode Island. He turned the Rams into a 23-win team in his third season after Rhode Island went 8-21 in Year 1.\n\nAfter taking the Rams to back-to-back NCAA tournaments in 2017 and 2018, Hurley was hired at UConn. The Huskies were a mess when he was brought in. UConn had finished under .500 in each of the previous two seasons and had made just one NCAA tournament appearance since winning the national title in 2014.\n\nUConn was 16-17 in Hurley's first season before winning 19 games in Year 2 before the COVID-19 pandemic prematurely ended the college basketball season. Since then, UConn has made the NCAA tournament four straight times and UConn has become the prominent program in men's college basketball.\n\nThe Huskies have obliterated their opponents in each of the past two NCAA tournaments. In 2023, UConn beat every team it played in the tournament by at least 13 points on the way to a national title win over San Diego State.\n\nUConn was even better in 2023-24. The Huskies lost just three games all season and beat their NCAA tournament opponents by an even wider margin. UConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 14 points. The Huskies beat Alabama 86-72 in the Final Four before beating Purdue 75-60 in the national title game.\n\nIf Hurley heads to the NBA, he would be the first NCAA tournament-winning coach to go from the college ranks to the NBA since Billy Donovan left Florida for the Oklahoma City Thunder after the 2014-15 college basketball season. Florida won back-to-back national titles in 2006 and 2007 under Donovan and made the Final Four in 2014.\n\nDonovan is still in the league with the Chicago Bulls, though Chicago hasn't been past the first round of the playoffs in his four years with the team. And he's a relative outlier among coaches who have made the leap in both success and tenure.\n\nThe same year Donovan was hired by the Thunder, the Bulls hired Fred Hoiberg from Iowa State. The Bulls were 40 games under .500 in three-plus seasons under Hoiberg and he's now the coach at Nebraska.\n\nSince Donovan and Hoiberg, just one college coach has been hired by an NBA team. The Cleveland Cavaliers hired Michigan's John Beilein in 2019, but he lasted just 54 games as the team's head coach. Cleveland went 14-40 in his short time with the team.\n\nOutside of Donovan, the most successful NBA coach to make the leap from the college ranks in modern history is Boston Celtics executive Brad Stevens. After back-to-back Final Fours at Butler in 2010 and 2011, Stevens was hired by the Boston Celtics as the team's head coach in 2013.\n\nOver eight seasons with the Celtics, Stevens was 354-282 as head coach, and Boston twice won more than 50 games in that span. He moved into the front office after the 2020-21 season and is currently the Celtics' president of basketball operations.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

It would be a splash hire and Hurley would make the jump to the NBA.\n\nIf Hurley is offered what is being reported as a \"full court press\" by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Auriemma said the two time champion would be crazy not to go to LA.\n\n\"If Danny were to leave, and somebody said to me, you know, he just took this NBA job,\" Auriemma said on the Dan Patrick Show. \"I won't name any particular city, I would say, you know, you're set up for failure. But it's the Lakers and I don't know the details of it, but if you're saying hey, I want a 10 year deal. I want the same deal Brad Stevens got at Boston ... Then you know what? Andrea, his wife might not like me, but he's crazy if he doesn't take it.\"\n\nAuriemma was at a function with Hurley Wednesday and actually brought up the Lakers. The team has a coaching vacancy and JJ Redick was a reported top candidate.\n\nThe former NBA and Duke star has no prior coaching experience and is currently a broadcaster for ESPN.\n\n\"It's really funny because I happened to be at a thing with him last night, and I have no idea what's going on, you know, I have no idea where this is going and what's happening,\" Auriemma said. \"But I said, just leaned over and I said, 'Hey, I think you can win a lot of championships with the Lakers. You know, more so than a guy who's never coached.'\n\n\"And he just looked at me and nodded, and we had a good laugh. And then this morning, I wake up and voila, so I don't know what's going on. It'd be a bad day for UConn for sure if this happens, and it would be a great, great day for Dan Hurley and I'm sure a bittersweet day for Dan Hurley.\"\n\nThere's talk this conversation is legit due to college basketball being what it is. If Hurley is going to coach pros, you might as well do it at the actual professional level.\n\n\"I think the state of college basketball is a mess,\" Auriemma said. \"If anybody could manage it, though, it would be Danny. Because he coaches this program like it's a high school program like he coached the St. Benedict's. Their player development program is second to none. But I do think that being at UConn and given the state of college basketball, the amount of money now that it's going to take to be able to put together a national championship team every single year and without knowing where it's going, it's a charade.\n\n\"This idea of student athlete welfare, every single thing that comes out of the NCAA's mouth about student athlete welfare, mental health, it's bull (expletive). That has no factor ever anymore, and I never want to hear anybody under those words associated with college basketball. They're professional athletes, just not called that.

When this process started for the Lakers, when they dismissed Darvin Ham, they obviously spoke to LeBron about the coaching situation. From what I understand what LeBron said to them was you have to hire somebody who is for beyond just me.\"\n\n\"I might be here for another year, I might be here for two years, you've got to make a decision that's built around Anthony Davis, that's built around what the Lakers need for the next decade not just what I need.\"\n\n\"Certainly, his feelings on the head coach are going to be taken into account but that's the message LeBron gave them this type of hire this type of going for this type of candidate aligns with that.\"\n\n\"Secondly LeBron has praised Dan Hurley and his acumen very recently in public, especially after this podcast he did with JJ Reddick.\" (4:45)\n\nDuring the Lakers' coaching search, following the dismissal of Darvin Ham, James highlighted the importance of selecting a coach who could guide the team beyond his own tenure, which might last another year or two. LeBron's input is crucial, but he stressed that the decision should be centered around Anthony Davis and the Lakers' long-term needs.\n\nLeBron's endorsement of a candidate who could contribute to the franchise's future reflects his understanding of the team's evolving dynamics. While his influence on the decision is undeniable, he made it clear that the new coach must be capable of supporting Davis and fostering the growth of the team for the next decade.\n\nThis perspective aligns with the Lakers' current pursuit of a suitable head coach, considering both immediate success and sustainable development.\n\nIn light of this, the Lakers have shown significant interest in Dan Hurley, the two-time NCAA Champion coach from the University of Connecticut. Reports suggest that the Lakers are preparing a substantial contract offer for Hurley, who has been a standout candidate from the beginning of their search.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reported that the Lakers are moving forward with discussions, aiming to secure Hurley's expertise for the team.\n\nHurley's impressive track record includes leading UConn to back-to-back NCAA titles and being named the 2024 Naismith College Coach of the Year and the 2024 BIG EAST Coach of the Year.\n\nHis team-building and player-development skills have made him a desirable candidate for the Lakers, who believe he can guide their young core -- featuring players like Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and Max Christie -- to greater heights.\n\nLeBron's recent praise for Hurley, especially during a podcast with JJ Redick where he lauded Hurley's coaching acumen, adds weight to the potential hiring. The Lakers are considering Hurley as a candidate who can adapt to the new NBA landscape under the collective bargaining agreement, which limits big-market teams' ability to trade multiple draft picks for a third-star player.\n\nThe Lakers' decision to target Hurley indicates their commitment to building a team that can sustain success beyond LeBron's tenure. While JJ Redick remains a strong candidate for the coaching position, Hurley's potential appointment could bring a fresh perspective to the Lakers, aligning with LeBron's vision for the franchise's future.\n\nRelated: Anthony Davis Reportedly Wants James Borrego Over JJ Redick As Lakers New Coach\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Coming in the aftermath of LA parting ways with former head coach Darvin Ham and Hurley turning down interest in other college head coaching jobs after leading the Huskies to back-to-back national championship wins.\n\nHurley wouldn't be the first head coach to make the jump from the college to the NBA level if he does join the Lakers. But on ESPN's Get Up, Wojnarowski compared his current crossroads to one that a basketball legend faced exactly 20 years ago.\n\n\"This is the 20th anniversary of the Lakers pursuit of Mike Krzyzewski,\" Wojnarowski said. \"They offered him $8 million a year in 2004, that puts you above average in the NBA right now. Massive offer for Mike Krzyzewski, he turned it down.\"\n\nKrzyzewski was reportedly offered a five-year, $40 million deal along with partial ownership in the Lakers in 2004 following the departure of Phil Jackson. A deal he clearly didn't take after spending 42 seasons with the Duke Blue Devils. But Woj believes that deal may have gone differently today given the drastic changes to the college athletics landscape.\n\n\"If Mike Krzyzewski was in the same position at the same age with the way college basketball has changed, he almost assuredly would probably be the Lakers coach,\" Wojnarowski said. \"That's what Dan Hurley is facing now, a very different world than what Mike Krzyzewski [faced]. He could dominate in college, and he did, he had won three national titles at that point. Can you continue to dominate at UConn? Is it sustainable? It might be.\"\n\nIt's no secret that the rise of NIL and the transfer portal has already significantly changed college athletics across all sports in its early stages. Particularly in revenue-driving sports like football and basketball where larger schools with bigger budgets and donor bases now have an advantage. A factor that Hurley will definitely have to consider, especially at UConn, when making a decision on his coaching future.\n\n\"Dan Hurley, his will, his stature in the profession, but there are going to be football schools with the ability with revenue sharing and NIL that are going to be able to offer players more money than you can,\" Wojnarowski explained. \"He's got a top five-team in the returning, a team that could potentially three-peat in college basketball.\"\n\n\"But if you want to coach in the NBA and you want to coach at that level, the Lakers give you a chance to get access to what you need to win a championship as well,\" Wojnarowski added. \"There's five, or six, or seven players. We all know who they are and you better have one of them if you're going to win a championship. The Lakers give you a little better chance than almost anywhere else to get that player and that's certainly everything Hurley's gotta look at right now.\"\n\nNotable head coaches like Krzyzewski, Jay Wright, and Roy Williams have recently stepped away from college basketball along with college head football coaches like Nick Saban and Jim Harbaugh. With many pointing at the changes in college sports and the new role head coaches have to play as a reason for the decision of these coaches and others. Making it fascinating to see what path Hurley decided to walk down after being presented with a massive, long-term contract with one of the most iconic franchises in all of professional sports.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaiden_smith@on3.com", "name": "Kaiden Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Williams_(basketball_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Williams (basketball coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Wright (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/06/06075527/Dan-K.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The former NBA veteran-turned ESPN analyst had been bandied about as the next big thing in Tinseltown after reports emerged claiming he was the top candidate for the Los Angeles gig.\n\nThings weren't quite as they appeared, however. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Thursday that UConn coach Dan Hurley, not Redick, was gaining traction as the favorite to man the Lakers in 2024-25. Conversations are set to take place in the coming few days and Los Angeles' front office is expected to table a \"massive, long-term\" contract to the two-time NCAA champion.\n\nHurley, 51, has taken the Huskies to new heights during his tenure on the sideline, spearheading back-to-back national championship runs in Storrs. For his efforts, he's been compensated handsomely, surpassing the likes of Tony Bennett, Brad Underwood and Eric Musselman. He even makes more money that fellow UConn legend, Geno Auriemma.\n\nMORE: Why the Lakers are targeting Dan Hurley over JJ Redick\n\nThe NBA is an entirely different beast, however. If he wants to make the leap to the professional circuit, he'll do so with the added cushion of a couple million dollars.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Hurley's current Huskies deal and how it compares to the tithes tacticians receive in the Association.\n\nAt present, Hurley makes $5.25 million per season as UConn's head coach. He inked a six-year, $31.5 million contract prior to the 2023-24 campaign, seemingly locking down his future at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion until 2029.\n\nThere are some caveats to that reported figure, namely that it doesn't include incentives. It's also worth noting that Hurley's contract extension was inked a year before John Calipari left Kentucky. If the timing was a bit different, Hurley likely could have added a few more M's in his bank account.\n\nMORE: Highest-paid men's college basketball coaches\n\nNevertheless, Hurley is doing fine by the collegiate standard. He is far and away the state of Connecticut's highest-paid employee, dwarfing Geno Auriemma's $3.2 million salary in 2023. Hurley also sits seventh on the highest-paid coaches list, trailing only Bill Self, John Calipari, Tom Izzo, Bruce Pearl, Rick Barnes and Scott Drew in yearly income:\n\nAt present, Hurley is making good money. If he were to try his luck in the Bigs, he would likely receive more of it.\n\nAlthough there are college coaches like Self, Calipari and Izzo making more dough than their NBA counterparts, the salary floor for NBA coaches hovers around $4 million, according to USA Today. First year bosses Darko Rajakovic (Toronto) and Will Hardy (Utah) are believed to have netted around that amount in their maiden NBA seasons. The ceiling, meanwhile, is astronomical. Just last year, the Pistons gave Monty Williams $78.5 million over six years. That's an average of $13.5 million a season. Detroit won 14 games this season.\n\nLeverage is king in the NBA. Doc Rivers had it in abundance following Adrian Griffin's midseason dismissal as Bucks head coach. Title-winning tacticians like Mike Malone and Nick Nurse were placed in similarly favorable positions during contract talks. Hurley has that in abundance, too. Although he hasn't made the grade on an NBA franchise, he doesn't actually have to leave Connecticut. The Huskies appear on the brink of college basketball dominance. And with five years left on his current deal, he's certainly in an advantageous negotiating position.\n\nFirst-year coaches tend to receive less money than their more experienced counterparts in the NBA. However, name and brand recognition can go a long way. Having another head-coaching gig doesn't hurt, either; Hurley, much like prep-to-pro predecessor Billy Donovan, has a well-paying job in hand already.

Los Angeles was then forced to find a new leader to replace the legendary coach.\n\nThey circled on former head coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke and offered him a record contract. He ended up turning it down to remain with the Blue Devils but this current process reflects a similar attempt from Los Angeles. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski explains.\n\n\"The pursuit of Hurley comes on the 20th anniversary of the Lakers trying to hire then-Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski to a record-breaking contract in 2004. Krzyzewski elected to remain with the Blue Devils, but the climate has dramatically changed in college athletics.\"\n\nIronically, Krzyzewski has been helping the Lakers look for a new head coach in the present, giving them advice on candidates. If Hurley were to leave UConn for Los Angeles, it would be one of the biggest shocks in recent memory.\n\nAll reports were that former NBA guard JJ Redick was the frontrunner for the open position, only to be hit with this news in the early morning on Thursday.

Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst who does a podcast with James; Hurley, the back-to-back national championship-winning coach of the Huskies; and James Borrego, the respected former Charlotte Hornets coach and ex-Gregg Popovich assistant who spent last season on New Orleans' staff.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Lakers aren't commenting publicly on the search to replace Ham.\n\nBut they sure are commenting privately.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Athletic reported that Redick shockingly was the frontrunner despite his total lack of coaching experience. On Thursday, the search took another wild turn when ESPN reported the Lakers were instead targeting Hurley, whose candidacy hadn't even been mentioned in many discussions of the job.\n\nThe crazy twists are representative of the various factions within the Lakers brain trust of owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka dispensing narratives to their favored media outlets. The Lakers previously seemed unlikely to make an official hire before the end of the NBA Finals, but the person who spoke to the AP said even that could change, depending on their progress.\n\nWhile the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics waited a week to begin the NBA Finals, the Lakers have dominated talk radio, television and message boards with speculation on the best choice to lead James and the Lakers back to contention for a second title together.\n\nThe Lakers are making their coaching change at a critical juncture for the franchise's partnership with the NBA's career scoring leader.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe 39-year-old James just completed his 21st season while playing at a higher level than anyone with that much experience in basketball history, but he has until June 29 to decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nJames could take the deal, or he could sign an even bigger new contract for more years -- or he could become a free agent for the first time in six years.\n\nWhile 31-year-old Anthony Davis is the Lakers' foundation with a long-term contract in Los Angeles, Buss and Pelinka are clearly determined to keep James alongside him for as long as possible -- even publicly floating their willingness to draft his son, Bronny, who just completed one brief collegiate season at USC.\n\nWhile agent Rich Paul has said James is not involved in the coaching search as he prepares to play for the U.S. at the Paris Olympics, the Lakers' candidates seem designed to appeal to him.\n\nJames' connection with Redick is well-known. James also recently praised Hurley on social media following a podcast interview between Redick and Hurley, with the 20-time All-Star writing that Hurley is \"so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their (offense). Love it.\"\n\nHurley has won 141 games in six seasons at UConn, rolling to the past two national titles in impressive fashion. The addition of the nation's top collegiate coach to the Lakers could be enticing to James and his son, who likely still needs extensive development to be a serviceable NBA player.\n\nThe Lakers' relative underachievement this season despite a healthy James and Davis was primarily blamed on Ham, the first-time head coach who dismayed many fans and observers with his rotations, preparation and strategic acumen. The Lakers have chased savvy basketball minds in their latest search, no matter their pedigree: Redick's encyclopedic understanding of the game has been on display in his podcast with James, while Hurley favors an NBA-friendly style of play that should translate well to the biggest basketball stage.\n\nWhoever they choose, the Lakers will be adding yet another head coach at a pace typically reserved for underachieving European soccer teams, not powerhouse NBA franchises.\n\nThe new hire will be the Lakers' eighth coach since Phil Jackson's departure in 2011 and their fourth coach since James arrived as a free agent in 2018. Frank Vogel led Los Angeles to the 2020 championship, but kept the job for only 225 games over three seasons before being fired exactly 18 months after raising the trophy in the Florida bubble.\n\nHam was the fourth coach fired by James' teams in the past eight years, joining Cleveland's David Blatt and the Lakers' Luke Walton and Vogel.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, when Kentucky came calling with their deep pockets back in April, Hurley declined, but the offer gave him and his agent another spike of negotiating power with the Huskies, who he's now taken to back to back titles.\n\nThere's been no word about a new deal for Hurley at UConn, but on Wednesday evening's coach's show, he said that contract negotiations aren't really something on the top of his mind.\n\n\"I mean, there's a lot, it's complicated,\" said Hurley. \"You know, there's a business side of it, which you allow your agent to advise you on. I'm not a businessman. I'm not good at that. I'm a one-trick pony.\"\n\nSince Hurley doesn't like to directly involve himself in such talks, he'd like to get it all over with while he starts building a 2025 team to compete for three straight.\n\n\"So, it's probably taken more time than I think any of us would have liked,\" he added. \"But it's not something that's ever, you know, been a rush for me. When you've won back to back championships, you're not calling your agent and worried about the status of your contract. You're more worried about recruiting, scheduling.\"\n\nOne person asked Hurley if he views a new contract and pay raise as a sort of reward for the successes on the court, and he answered:\n\n\"Yeah, yeah I think so. You know, you sacrifice a lot to do this job. It's a high-pressure job. The job beats your ass pretty good and it's a total commitment.\"\n\nBecause of that commitment, other facets of Hurley's life (and other college coaches) must suffer.\n\n\"A lot suffers because of it your family, any chance at any type of a social life. It consumes everything that you have. There's a price you pay for it.\"\n\nAfter paying that price, and producing immense success, then sure, Hurley is ready to see what his agent can do for him on the business side of things.\n\n\"And you also have a market as a coach, you know, when you've accomplished a lot things. Trying to find that sweet spot is something.\"\n\nWe'll see if UConn can find a sweet enough spot in their new deal to coax Dan Hurley back to Storrs and away from LA.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weber@on3.com", "name": "Alex Weber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storrs,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storrs, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Storrs, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Agents", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Agents", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/03/31105908/GettyImages-1237890169.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Assuming James returns to L.A. in free agency, the possibility of using the 55th overall pick in this month's NBA draft on USC freshman guard Bronny James makes Hurley an even more intriguing candidate,\" Woj reports.\n\n\"If that happens, James gets a chance to play with his son and the benefit of Hurley and his staff becoming responsible for Bronny's pro-development.\" [via ESPN]\n\nAlthough rumors earlier this month indicated that the Lakers were zeroing in on LeBron's Mind the Game podcast co-host J.J. Reddick, Woj says that Hurley as been at the top of the Lakers' list since the beginning of the hiring process.\n\nLeBron is certainly a fan of Hurley's, as a tweet from April praised him and his UConn staff for their offensive schemes.\n\n\"He's so DAMN GOOD!!! Along with his staff. Super creative with their O! Love it,\" James said of Hurley.\n\nDespite Bronny currently being somewhere between the 50th and 60th highest-rated prospect in the draft -- and there are only 58 picks in the NBA Draft -- his being selected when the draft is held on June 26 is a virtual certainty. The Lakers currently own the 17th and 55th picks in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nWhat makes the situation even more complicated for the Lakers is that just three days after the draft is the deadline for LeBron to accept or decline his $51.4 million player option, with many expecting him to decline so he can hit the open market and sign a new, more lucrative deal with Los Angeles. In short: LeBron can basically threaten to walk away if they don't draft Bronny.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_italiano@brobible.com", "name": "Eric Italiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lebron-james-and-his-son-bronny-james-shaking-hands.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1821, "textEnd": 1828}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Hurley famously called his shot back in 2020, claiming that opposing teams \"better get us now\" because he saw a reckoning coming. Then, after the Huskies won their second consecutive National Championship back in April, Hurley boldly declared, \"for the last 25, 30 years, UConn's been running college basketball.\" And let's just be honest, he's not wrong.\n\nIn the last thirty years, not only has the UConn's men's basketball team won six National Championships -- the most in that span -- but the women's team, led by Hall of Fame coach Geno Auriemma, has won eleven titles of their own. And now, Dan Hurley has the UConn Huskies men's team on the brink of accomplishing something that Auriemma's squads have done twice, but something no men's team has done in over fifty years... winning three consecutive National Championships.\n\nDan Hurley isn't shying away from the challenge. He's openly discussed it multiple times since the Huskies defeated Purdue to win their second straight title, and while taking in the fights with his son Andrew at UFC 302 over the weekend, the Huskies fiery head coach couldn't resist calling his shot.\n\nIn early May, Dan Hurley made some noise when he told reporters, \"We think, top to bottom, this could be our most talented roster,\" (h/t Adam Zagoria of NJ.com). This was nearly a full month before Alex Karaban decided to come back to UConn for another season and a chance at a 3-peat. Following Karaban's announcement of a return to Storrs for one more season, the Huskies' championship odds jumped from +1300 to +900 on Hard Rock Bet, allowing UConn to overtake the Kansas Jayhawks and Duke Blue Devils as the favorites to win the 2025 National Championship. And rightfully so.\n\nCan anyone stop a UConn 3-peat?\n\nAside from Kansas (+1100) and Duke (+1200), perennial powerhouses who have loaded up once again heading into the 2024-25 season, the Huskies will likely be challenged by more of the usual suspects. The Alabama Crimson Tide (+1600), who got the good news of a Mark Sears return to Tuscaloosa last week, have the 4th-best championship odds. The Tide are followed by Houston and North Carolina, who are each listed at +2000. As pseudo-sleepers, I'm intrigued by both Arkansas (+4000) and Kentucky (+4000), who each enter new eras... the Razorbacks with John Calipari, and the Wildcats without him.\n\nWithin the Big East, there seems to be no legitimate contender to challenge the UConn Huskies. Creighton, Marquette, and St. John's each have +5000 odds right now to win the National Championship, but all three schools will sit well-behind the two-time defending champs atop the Big East preseason polls come October.\n\nAs the 2024-25 season plays out, a handful of teams will position themselves as true contenders to keep Connecticut from making history, and as is always the case in the NCAA Tournament, there will be a Cinderella or two who has something to say about things come late March. But from now until the time somebody manages to defeat the Huskies in the Big Dance, the road to the championship still runs through Storrs.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

It had more in common with the 1890s YMCA where James Naismith first brought out some peach baskets than gleaming Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIt was inside the White Eagle that Dan Hurley -- reigning two-time national champ at Connecticut, reported first choice in the Lakers coaching search -- first learned the game. It's where he first learned the fire that was needed, first learned the fight that it required, first learned the talent and tenacity necessary to separate victory from defeat.\n\nAnd it was there that he and his older brother, current Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley, learned that every last tactical advantage, every inch of separation gained on a cut here, a flare there mattered. He learned that the little things count on a court that was some 20-feet shorter than regulation, whose unforgiving walls stood just two feet from out of bounds.\n\nHow do you get open shots on a court where \"open\" didn't exist? How do you box out inside of a box?\n\nBy being somehow both tougher and smarter than the other guys.\n\nThis was the basketball office of Bob Hurley, Dan's father, who spent his days as a Hudson County probation office and his night's as about the most demanding coach basketball ever knew. Bob Hurley took over at St. Anthony's High School in 1972 and won 26 state titles over the next 39 seasons, sending some 150 players on to college scholarships.\n\nThe actual St. Anthony's high school was down the street, hard by the Holland Tunnel, in a squat four-story, mid-block structure that was so small it didn't even have the comically limited space The Eagle could offer. Bob Hurley managed to win four national titles at a high school with literally no gym. No wonder he was enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nSt. Anthony's never played an actual \"home\" game. That dusty bingo hall was all there was for practice. A couple times a year the boys would grab hammers and help their dad bang protruding nails back into the hardwood floor.\n\nIf Dan Hurley leaves Connecticut for the Lakers, it is merely the latest step in the manifest destiny of one of basketball's most important families. Bob could have gone on to coach college, probably could have gone on to coach in the NBA, but he believed his calling was to never leave Jersey City.\n\nBob did everything he could for the city and the school, for his family and his friends.\n\nHe tried to preemptively help local kids by teaching them discipline through basketball at a high school he fought to keep open and then later tried to help redeem those that slipped past him by working as a probation officer. It was a humble life, but he was passionate about raising money for St. Anthony's -- including nationalizing the story through Adrian Wojnarowski's epic 2005 book \"The Miracle of St. Anthony's\" -- until modern realities finally proved too much and the school closed in 2017.\n\nDan followed the same path at first, spending a decade at nearby Newark St. Benedict's before finally jumping into the college ranks at Wagner, Rhode Island and then UConn.\n\nIt was these last two years where it all truly came together, Hurley taking two different rosters to the same place -- a national title. Dan became just the seventh coach to manage that, but his might be most impressive. It wasn't the product of a returning starting five. This was finding the right guys to play the right system under the right demands, twice.\n\nToday's college basketball isn't the college basketball of even Billy Donovan (Florida 2006-2007) or Mike Krzyzewski (1991-1992), let alone Henry Iba (Oklahoma State 1945-1946) and John Wooden (1964-1965, 1967-73).\n\nIt's fair to say no coach in basketball did a better job the last two seasons than Hurley and it's fair to say that at no point in time has the skill set required to win in college be so similar to the skill set required to win in the NBA. You can't just land a couple stud recruits. Hurley's Huskies played the game with both a relentless pace and a relentless efficiency.\n\nIt was homage to everything built and learned at the White Eagle, everything from a basketball lab that no less than Bob Knight once arrived at on a recruiting visit, surveyed not just the scene but the ethos it produced and declared, \"I love this [expletive] place.\"\n\nSo now here comes the Lakers -- 17 NBA titles, the franchise of Magic and Kobe, of Kareem and Shaq and the Logo, the one with a celebrity row and LeBron James and LA Live.\n\nThe Lakers were willing to take a flier on a coach with a big upside -- J.J. Redick has been in the mix -- and Dan Hurley certainly represents that. He's also more proven than most.\n\nCan he coach with his same current fire 82 nights a year? Of course not. Does he need to tone down the disputes with rival fans? Of course he does. Can you run NBA practices like the players are teenagers in a bingo hall? Obviously not.\n\nHurley, 51, is smart. One thing being a high school coach, let alone the son of a successful high school coach, teaches is that circumstances, personalities and roster strengths fluctuate. This isn't your typical college coaching legend. He isn't the product of a shoe company plying him with an endless stream of elite talent.\n\nThe Hurleys are pure basketball; that perfect combination of effort and intelligence that makes the game what it is.\n\nDan Hurley may be headed to the Lakers. It was probably inevitable.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hurley's plan is to have his mind made up on the decision weighing on him in the near future, a source said.\n\nAfter reports surfaced that the Lakers are targeting the 51-year-old head coach of the back-to-back men's college basketball national champions, Hurley didn't want to hide from his players in sharing that the rumors were true. Hurley told his team -- which is No. 2 in our FOX Sports Way Too Early Top 25 and trying to become the first program since John Wooden's UCLA teams to 3-peat for a national championship in 2025 -- that it's \"business as usual\" for now. Their practice was scheduled for noon on Thursday in Storrs.\n\nA source tells FOX Sports that Hurley is \"truly at a 50-50\" in weighing his decision whether to make the leap up for LeBron James and the Lakers or stay in the college game and try to achieve something unthinkable in the modern era.\n\n\"He deals with things mentally where he's constantly seeking to prove what he can do,\" a source told FOX Sports.\n\nAs for Hurley's current position, a source tells FOX Sports that the University of Connecticut has offered the coach a lucrative new contract that would make him one of the highest-paid coaches in the country, featuring significant widespread benefits for him. Hurley said Wednesday that \"it's complicated, and it's taken more time (to get a deal done) than any of us would have liked. It's not something that's been a rush for me. You sacrifice a lot to do this job. The job beats your ass pretty good, and a lot suffers with your family. Any chance at a social life, it consumes everything you have.\"\n\nKeep this in mind: UConn is not in the power four conferences, currently residing in the Big East, and the money required to offer this new deal to Hurley does not get done easily at a place like Connecticut. But a deal has been on the table and placed in front of Hurley's team.\n\nFinances aside, a source says Hurley is weighing whether he wants to make this move. He has northeast roots and his father, Bob Sr., is 76, very involved in his life and a fixture at UConn games. His wife Andrea and boys, Dan and Andrew, are happy in the northeast but his sons are past college, so one would think that could make a move easier.\n\n\"His parents are still here and still very much a part of his life, and it's convenient for the family to be in this part of the country,\" a source said. \"But there's that angle that there may never be a better opportunity than this one right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Wooden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storrs,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storrs, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Storrs, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_East_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big East Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/04/1408/814/UConnHurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Discussions are set to escalate in the coming days, sources said.\n\nAfter the Washington Wizards removed the interim tag and named Brian Keefe as their new head coach on May 29, just two teams -- the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers -- are without head coaches. For the Lakers and Cavs, it's about searching for a new voice to continue playoff and championship pursuits.\n\nMike Budenholzer's move to the Phoenix Suns' sideline came after the franchise fired Frank Vogel in early May. The Brooklyn Nets have already confirmed their decision, bringing in former Sacramento Kings assistant and current Canadian national team coach Jordi Fernandez to be their next coach. The Charlotte Hornets will tap Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee for what sources told Wojnarowski will be a four-year deal.\n\nWho will join them among new faces on the sideline next season? Here's the latest intel on the two remaining jobs, the top candidates and the challenges ahead for each franchise.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nThe state of the franchise: Since Phil Jackson retired after the 2010-11 season, the Lakers have made six coaching hires, with none lasting more than three seasons -- including the only one to win a championship during that stretch, Frank Vogel. Under Ham, the Lakers reached the 2023 Western Conference finals and followed it by winning four more regular-season games in 2023-24. But it wasn't enough to avoid being fired after two seasons.\n\nThe franchise's next coach will take over a team that features one of the NBA's best star duos in LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers could also be in the mix this summer for a third star to play alongside James -- who has a $51.4 million player option for next season -- and Davis.\n\nJames and Davis combined to play 147 games this season -- the most in their five years together -- and yet that wasn't enough for Los Angeles to finish higher than eighth in the regular-season standings. Between young teams at the top such as the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder, and others on the rise such as the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs, ascending in the West will be a challenge once again next season.\n\nAlso likely to return, no matter who the franchise hires to replace Ham, are the expectations and tumult that has defined the franchise for more than a decade. But for a team that has made 32 Finals appearances and is tied with the Boston Celtics for the most titles (17) in NBA history, the expectation is to contend for titles over play-in position -- especially with James on the roster.\n\nWho could get the job: Wojnarowski reported Thursday that the Lakers have had UConn coach Dan Hurley at the forefront of their search since the franchise fired Darvin Ham on May 3 and are preparing to offer the back-to-back NCAA champion a long-term contract to lure Hurley to the NBA. Discussions are expected to continue in the coming days, sources said.\n\nHurley, who has spent the last six seasons in Storrs, has often described his ambition to one day coach in the NBA and has expressed to the Lakers a desire to explore a partnership with one of basketball's winningest franchises, sources told Wojnarowski.\n\nThe Lakers have interviewed several other candidates over the past month, including New Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell, Denver Nuggets assistant David Adelman and JJ Redick, sources said. The Lakers have proceeded with conversations with other candidates over the past few weeks, but the potential of landing Hurley has been the focus of the Lakers' search, sources said.\n\nRedick, who currently hosts a podcast with James and interviewed for the Toronto Raptors' coaching job in 2023, spent more than a decade as one of the NBA's best shooters.\n\nBorrego helped New Orleans jump from 20th to 11th in offensive efficiency this season after overseeing 10-win improvements in each of his final three seasons with Charlotte from 2020-22. He was also the Orlando Magic's interim coach in 2015 and spent several years under Gregg Popovich as an assistant in San Antonio.\n\nLA Clippers coach Tyronn Lue had been previously named as a potential candidate, given his championship history with James -- they won the 2016 NBA title together and reached three Finals with Cleveland. However, Lue finalized a new deal with the Clippers on May 29.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nThe state of the franchise: Bickerstaff led the Cavaliers to a winning record in three straight seasons but was let go after following up last year's desultory first-round loss to the New York Knicks with a seven-game series victory over the Orlando Magic and a quick exit at the hands of the top-seeded Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nBut this team is well-positioned for the next several years. Three of the team's four young pillars -- Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen -- are under contract, while Donovan Mitchell is extension-eligible this summer. Max Strus and Georges Niang brought shooting and veteran leadership as free agent signings, and Isaac Okoro showed offensive growth this season while remaining a plus wing defender.\n\nDespite the Cavs' small market, owner Dan Gilbert has shown throughout his tenure that he will spare no expense to deliver winning basketball to Cleveland. If this team remains in contention, it's unlikely any players will be lost because Gilbert isn't willing to spend.\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest question mark in Cleveland is whether Mitchell will sign a contract extension to remain with the franchise beyond the one guaranteed year left on his deal. If he doesn't, Cleveland's Kyrie Irving situation from seven years ago should serve as a reminder that Gilbert likely won't allow Mitchell to walk as a free agent after sending several draft picks (plus Lauri Markkanen) to the Utah Jazz for him two years ago.\n\nEven if Mitchell returns, there's at least some question about the direction of the roster. The Cavs have two small, ball-dominant guards (Garland and Mitchell) and two non-shooting big men (Mobley and Allen), with each set of players having overlapping skill sets. Will Cleveland's new coach believe they can make them work? Or will they try to push for a different vision for the roster?\n\nWho could get the job: The Cavs have secured permission to interview several assistant coaches from around the league. Sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that the team will talk with New York Knicks associate head coach Johnnie Bryant and the Miami Heat top assistant Chris Quinn. In addition, Wojnarwoski reported that Golden State Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and New Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego were also on the Cavs' list.\n\nBryant has spent four years on Tom Thibodeau's staff and previously worked his way from player development coach to a front-of-the-bench assistant with the Utah Jazz, where he worked closely with Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell for six years. Quinn, an Ohio native, has spent 10 years on Erik Spoelstra's staff with the Heat after an NBA and European playing career.\n\nAtkinson, the former Brooklyn Nets coach who has been Steve Kerr's lead assistant with the Warriors the past three seasons, has received praise for developing several young players. That list includes two current Cavaliers -- Caris LeVert and Allen -- while turning Brooklyn into a playoff team. He also is known as an offensive coach, having worked under both Mike D'Antoni and Mike Budenholzer, and could potentially bring more organization to that side of the ball for the Cavs.\n\nThe state of the franchise: Winger and general manager Will Dawkins -- both of whom have deep roots with the Oklahoma City Thunder -- have set out to follow a similar diligent blueprint to the one Thunder executive Sam Presti has successfully executed in OKC -- twice. Wizards owner Ted Leonsis is also viewed around the league as one of the more patient of his cohort, and whichever coach the franchise lands will be of the understanding that this rebuild will not happen quickly.\n\nNot only is Washington's current roster short on talent, but this year's draft (the Wizards will have the No. 2 pick) lacks the projected star power of future classes in 2025 and 2026. As a result, whoever gets this job should be expecting a heavy focus on player development, which could create uncertain futures for Washington's other veterans, including Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma, who each have three years remaining on their contracts.\n\nWho got the job: Keefe went 8-31 over the final three months of the season after replacing Unseld in January. Like Winger and Dawkins, Keefe spent time in Oklahoma City, working for the Thunder from 2009-14. The 48-year-old went on to serve as an assistant with the New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets, Lakers and Wizards, in addition to spending the 2019-20 season back with the Thunder under then-coach Billy Donovan.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nThe state of the franchise: It has been an eventful 15 months for Suns owner Mat Ishbia. He swung on a pair of high-profile trades for Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, and has now moved on from a pair of coaches in Monty Williams, who was fired after last season, and Vogel, who was dismissed after being swept out of the first round by the Timberwolves.\n\nStill, Ishbia believes his team remains in an envious position.\n\n\"Ask the other 29 GMs, 26 of them would trade their whole team for our whole team and our draft picks and everything as is,\" Ishbia said earlier this month during his end-of-season media availability.\n\n\"The house is not on fire. ... It's not hard to fix this. It's not like, 'We don't have enough talent to win a championship.' We have enough talent to win a championship.\"\n\nThe Suns will return their star core of Devin Booker, Durant and Beal, who shot a career-high 43% from 3-point range this season, capitalizing on the defensive attention paid to Booker and Durant. Grayson Allen, meanwhile, was signed to an extension last month after leading the league in 3-point percentage (46.1). Starting big man Jusuf Nurkic is under contract for next year.\n\nBut Phoenix will enter the offseason with the league's highest payroll -- ESPN's Bobby Marks projects the Suns' salary next season to be more than $200 million, well over the new second luxury tax apron. Those salary cap restrictions, combined with the loss of draft capital due to previous blockbuster trades, have handcuffed Phoenix from a roster-building standpoint.\n\nWho got the job: Former Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer will now take over in Phoenix -- the team's third coach in as many seasons. Budenholzer, who grew up northeast of Phoenix, has won more than 60% of his games and clinched the 2021 NBA championship with Milwaukee. He sat out last season after getting fired following the Bucks' shocking first-round loss to the Miami Heat.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nThe state of the franchise: A lot has changed in Charlotte since a new ownership group led by Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin took over last summer, with previous owner Michael Jordan retaining a minority stake. The Hornets have proposed plans for a new practice facility, hired Peterson away from the Nets and made multiple deals at the February trade deadline to bring in both future draft picks and young players such as former Oklahoma City Thunder guard Tre Mann.\n\nThe Hornets are looking to build around its youth. LaMelo Ball broke through for an All-Star selection in 2022, but the 22-year-old guard has played a combined 58 games over the past two seasons. No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller, who finished third in Rookie of the Year voting behind Victor Wembanyama and Chet Holmgren, averaged 17.3 points per game, shot 37.3% from 3-point range and has begun developing into the two-way force Charlotte hoped. Second-year center Mark Williams showed promise before a back issue limited him to 19 games this season.\n\nCharlotte isn't immune to the challenges of building a small-market contender, and new ownership has not revealed its willingness to pay the luxury tax. The Hornets are one of two teams -- along with the New Orleans Pelicans -- to never pay the tax.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hornets have made the playoffs just three times since returning to the league in the 2004-05 season, and their three total playoff victories over that span are the fewest of any NBA team.\n\nWho got the job: Charlotte announced on May 9 that Charles Lee, currently the top assistant under Joe Mazzulla for the league-leading Boston Celtics, would be succeeding Clifford as the team's head coach. Lee is one of the league's most prominent assistant coaches, having interviewed for several jobs in recent seasons and playing a key role both with Boston this year, as the Celtics had the NBA's best record, and for the past few under Mike Budenholzer in both Milwaukee, where the Bucks won the 2021 NBA title, and Atlanta before that. Budenholzer's tree includes several successful head coaches, including Quin Snyder, Taylor Jenkins, Kenny Atkinson and Darvin Ham, and now Lee will get a chance to add to that list with some intriguing young talent and a new leadership team in Charlotte.\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nThe state of the franchise: Outside of their poor finish this season, the Nets have plenty going for them. They are in the league's biggest market, have one of its richest owners in Joe Tsai, have a terrific arena in Barclays Center and a modern practice facility overlooking New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThey landed a series of draft picks from the aging and expensive Phoenix Suns that could reap them future rewards. And, unlike some of the other open jobs this offseason, there is some present-day talent on the roster that could be competitive right now -- at least for a play-in tournament spot.\n\nBrooklyn appeared headed in that direction when it was 15-15 on the morning of Dec. 27. But after the Nets chose to tank a home game against the Milwaukee Bucks that night, they went 17-35 over the final 52 games and tumbled down the standings.\n\nMikal Bridges is an All-Star-caliber two-way wing player who has played every game of his career. After that, however, there are questions. Cam Thomas is an intriguing scoring guard, but he is one of the league's more polarizing players. Nic Claxton, the team's starting center, is an unrestricted free agent, though Brooklyn is confident about re-signing the 25-year-old.\n\nWho got the job: Fernandez was widely expected to get a head-coaching job somewhere in the NBA during this cycle because of his work alongside Mike Brown in Sacramento and helping lead Canada to its first international medal in decades, a bronze medal in last year's FIBA World Cup. Fernandez has also been an assistant with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Denver Nuggets during his NBA career, and his hiring presents Brooklyn with the ability to go in multiple directions this summer, as they could opt for a rebuild after a disappointing season or aggressively pursue veteran talent to try to take a step forward. The presence of talented, younger players such as Bridges and Claxton -- plus upcoming salary flexibility and draft picks to move -- gives Brooklyn a lot of different directions it can pivot in, depending on what opportunities present themselves.", "source": {"uri": "espn.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's going to pick up here in the coming days and this is becoming a conversation now between Hurley and the Lakers.\"\n\nAs for Bronny, he was medically cleared to play in the NBA after undergoing cardiac arrest last summer and then having a procedure to follow up. He debuted at USC in December and averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists for a Trojans team that finished 15-18.\n\nBronny said last month at the NBA Combine his goal was to make the NBA, not necessarily to play with his famous father.\n\n\"My dream has always just been to put my name out, make a name for myself, and, of course, get to the NBA,\" he said last week. \"Which is what everyone's end goal is here. I've never thought about playing with my dad, but of course he's brought it up a couple of times.\"\n\nESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins says Bronny will be a better NBA player than college player.\n\n\"Just because he didn't have a helluva college season and he is not showing signs of being a good college player, that doesn't mean he's not going to be a good pro,\" Perkins said in March.\n\n\"College basketball and professional basketball are two different lanes.\"\n\nAnd now it's possible Hurley could be Bronny's next coach.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

For Dan Hurley, though, few factors will have as big of an impact on the latest regarding his career than his family, specifically his spouse.\n\nHowever, no matter what other details emerge, Andrea Hurley, his wife and the mother of their two sons, will play a massive part in this process according to Greenberg. Hurley will go through this and make any potential decision with her at his side.\n\n\"Here's the caveat in the whole thing: his wife will have as big a say in this thing is anyone. Andrea will have as big a say in this decision as anyone,\" said Greenberg. \"If they go out there and they look at this job? Alright, he's not taking this job, unless they're in it together because they do everything.\"\n\n\"They are in it together - believe me,\" Greenberg said.\n\nHurley's name made a stunning appearance in the head coaching search for the Lakers on Thursday. Although others like JJ Redick had been under heavy consideration, no other names had truly popped up in the matter. That was until this huge development regarding the head coach of the Huskies.\n\nThis comes after what Hurley has done over the past two seasons at Connecticut. Over six years with the Huskies, he has posted a 141-58 (.709) record. During 2022 and 2023, that features a record of 68-11 (.861) with two conference titles in the Big East. Back-to-back national titles highlight it as the first consecutive champion in the sport in a decade and a half.\n\nHurley appeared set to remain in Storrs for the foreseeable future. Completely denying the opening at Kentucky reflected that thought earlier on this offseason. Still, the NBA is a whole other ball game, especially with a chance to coach the premier franchise in the association along with one of the game's all-time greats in LeBron James.\n\nHurley himself has reportedly made it known that he is in talks with Los Angeles at this point. With that being the case, it's just a matter of how those conversations go from here, including Mrs. Hurley's role in them, to decide if he'll be possibly jumping from college to the pros here soon.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_gillenwater@on3.com", "name": "Sam Gillenwater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_East_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big East Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storrs,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storrs, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Storrs, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/11110638/Untitled-design-21-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Dan Hurley led UConn to back-to-back NCAA men's basketball championships the last two seasons. Now, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Los Angeles Lakers are targeting Hurley to become their next head coach.\n\nHarbaugh's departure - combined with Alabama coach Nick Saban's retirement - means there are three active FBS coaches with national championships. Georgia's Kirby Smart and Clemson's Dabo Swinney are the only ones who won a national title at their current school. North Carolina coach Mack Brown won a national title with Texas in 2005.\n\nIf Hurley leaves, there would be six active coaches with national championships. Michigan State's Tom Izzo, Kansas' Bill Self, Baylor's Scott Drew and Virginia's Tony Bennett are at their current schools. St. John's coach Rick Pitino won national titles at Kentucky and Louisville, the latter which was vacated by the NCAA. First-year Arkansas coach John Calipari won a national title at Kentucky.\n\nIs that dwindling number an indictment of the landscape of the two major revenue men's college sports?\n\nBefore answering that question, you have to compare the Harbaugh and Hurley situations and the challenges they would face at the next level.\n\nHarbaugh and Hurley both have strong family coaching histories.\n\nDan's father Bob won 26 state championships at St. Anthony High School in Jersey City, N.J. Dan's brother Bobby won two national championships as a point guard for Duke and will enter his 10th season at Arizona State. Dan Hurley was a point guard at Seton Hall and started his coaching career as an assistant at St. Anthony.\n\nJim Harbaugh's father Jack was a longtime college assistant at Michigan before becoming a head coach at Western Michigan and Western Kentucky. He led the Hilltoppers to a I-AA national title in 2002. Jim's brother John won the brothers' head-to-head Super Bowl 47 matchup. Jim played quarterback in the NFL for 14 seasons before launching a coaching career.\n\nHurley and Harbaugh have both had ups-and-downs in their coaching careers, but both coaches were at their best this season.\n\nMichigan finished with a 40-3 record the last three years, and Harbaugh led the Wolverines to three consecutive Big Ten championships, CFP appearances and the program's first national title since 1997. UConn is 68-11 the last two seasons, and they have dominated the NCAA tournament with two remarkable national championship runs.\n\nHarbaugh and Hurley are known for their unique coaching style, combative behavior and unpredictable press conferences -- and both beat Alabama in the national semifinals in their respective sports last season.\n\nWhy would Hurley leave a chance for a three-peat?\n\nAccording to ESPN, the Lakers are \"preparing a massive, long-term contract offer\" for Hurley to become the next coach, which would be a swift U-turn from the reports that NBA analyst J.J. Redick was a potential candidate.\n\nHurley is known for his offensive sets. SN's Steph Noh writes: \"No other coach incorporates as much movement into their offenses. His sets are complicated and more precise than a Swiss watch, leading to great shots for his team.\"\n\nThis kind of move would not be unprecedented. Rick Pitino left Kentucky for the Boston Celtics in 1998. Billy Donovan left Florida for Oklahoma City in 2015.\n\nMORE: History of college coaches heading to the NBA\n\nHarbaugh served two three-game suspensions at Michigan last season. The first was a school-imposed suspension from a NCAA case involving impermissible content with recruits during COVID-19. The second was a Big Ten suspension in connection with an NCAA in-person scouting investigation involving staffer Connor Stalions, who was fired.\n\nHarbaugh returned and led Michigan to a national championship, but instead of taking a contract extension he returned to the NFL with the Los Angeles Chargers ahead of the 2024 season.\n\nThat is the immediate concern with reports about Hurley and the Lakers.\n\nThis discussion generally brings up NIL and the transfer portal with the next sentence, and there is probably some truth to it in certain cases. Alabama coach Nick Saban voiced concerns with both before retiring on Jan. 10, but he was also 72 years old.\n\nHarbaugh is a different case. He coached with the San Francisco 49ers from 2011-14, took an interview with the Minnesota Vikings in 2022 and had been open about chasing a Super Bowl championship. Saban, Pete Carroll and Urban Meyer are other national championship coaches this century who coached in the NFL, and Butch Davis was close to a national title at Miami in 2000 before leaving for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nGeorgia coach Kirby Smart signed a 10-year, $130 million contract on May 2. As long as elite college football coaches are paid that much, there will not be a shortage. Plus, are free agency and mega-contracts that much different from the pros?\n\nHurley is on a six-year, $32.1 million contract. He is the seventh-highest paid coach in the game. NBA coaching salaries look more like college football coaching salaries, so that is part of the answer.\n\nThe other it's the Los Angeles Lakers - the NBA's glamour franchise - and possibly LeBron James - who has won four NBA championships. That is winning at the highest level. Donovan and Pitino tried. Mike Krzyzewski was among the coaches who passed on that opportunity. If Hurley leaves, then it would appear to be more of a shift in the college basketball rank. Krzyzewski, Roy Williams, Jim Boeheim and Jay Wright are among the national championship coaches who have retired in recent seasons.\n\nThis has less to do with NIL and the transfer portal and more about the money and allure of competing at the highest level. That is the real answer here. Given the coaching background of Harbaugh and Hurley, that should not be much of a surprise.\n\nThe Chargers have never won a Super Bowl, but Harbaugh is off to a good start. Los Angeles had a strong draft, and they have a franchise quarterback in Justin Herbert. The Chargers had four winning seasons the last seven years under Anthony Lynn and Brandon Staley.\n\nThey are in the AFC West with the Kansas City Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes II, but Harbaugh was 44-19-1 in the regular season and 5-3 in the playoffs with the 49ers. He has proven he can win at the NFL level, but that was more than 10 years ago. It's a new challenge, but Harbaugh will be given some room given the five-year deal that pays close to $16 million a year.\n\nHurley is a more interesting fit. The Lakers won 17 championships, with their last one coming in the 2019-20. That is always the expectation for the franchise, but they have a combined record of 165-163 the last four seasons. James' future - not to mention the future of Bronny James - are possible layers to Los Angeles' future and could make that challenge more difficult. Hurley would be Los Angeles' fifth coach since 2014.\n\nBoth coaches would face hurdles, but they can succeed at the next level.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Geno Auriemma would understand if the head coach leaves UConn.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Lakers are prepared to make the Huskies men's basketball head coach a \"massive\" offer. If that's the case, UConn's women's coach thinks Hurley should accept.\n\n\"If Danny were to leave, and somebody said to me, 'he just took this NBA job.' I won't name any particular city. I would say you're set up for failure,\" Auriemma said Thursday morning on The Dan Patrick Show, via On3. \"But it's the Lakers. And I don't know the details of it, but if you're saying, 'Hey, I want a 10-year deal. I want the same deal Brad Stevens got at Boston.' Then you know what? Andrea, his wife, might not like me, but he's crazy if he doesn't take it.\"\n\nAuriemma claimed he coincidentally mentioned the Lakers position to Hurley on Wednesday before having any information about the NBA team's reported interest in the back-to-back national champion. He seemed to reference rumors of Los Angeles pursuing JJ Redick.\n\n\"I happened to be at a thing with him last night, and I have no idea what's going on. I have no idea where this is going and what's happening,\" Auriemma told Patrick. \"But I just leaned over and I said, 'Hey, I think you can win a lot of championships with the Lakers.

His Huskies have won back-to-back national championships and could be poised to compete for a third straight.\n\nWhich makes it perhaps all that more surprising that Hurley is apparently seriously considering -- and in consideration for -- the vacant role coaching the Los Angeles Lakers. And while the move might be shocking on the surface, jumping to one of the NBA's most iconic brands and likely coaching LeBron James is an opportunity few, if any, coaches would pass on.\n\nESPN college hoops analyst Seth Greenberg explained why Hurley might want to make the jump on First Take on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Here's the deal; the Lakers is a better job if -- and here's my if -- if he controls his infrastructure, if he has a say in personnel,\" Greenberg said. \"I say this all the time; in college, you've got to be connected to your athletic director and your assistant coach needs to know who can play for the head coach. In the NBA, you got to be connected to the president and your general manager, personnel people need to understand who can play for the head coach. If that is in place, then he takes the Laker job.\n\n\"Coaching, there's going to be a transition. The Lakers need a culture, they need an identity, they need accountability. They need core beliefs and nonnegotiables, similar to what [Udonis Haslem] went through when he was with the Heat, when when Pat Riley was the coach of the Lakers. They've lost a little of that, giving him the authority to have those type of infrastructure, then the Lakers [are] a better job, especially due to the fact that the state of college athletics today.\"\n\nGreenberg continued, explaining what he meant by the state of college athletics being less attractive than the stability of the NBA.\n\n\"The state of college athletics today, there's a have and a have not,\" Greenberg said. \"The Power Five conferences, you have 20% which is going to be your collective bargaining agreement. Twenty percent of the money that they're they're generating compared to the Big East, alright. Dan Hurley's spending a good amount of his time raising money, you don't have to worry about that in the NBA. He's not at a place where there's going to be a donor that's gonna give him 5 million for his NIL and his collective. So in terms of pure coaching, Danny Hurley -- there'll be a transition period. There'll be -- he'll need to show agility. He's not going to be able to coach exactly the same way he did, but he will still hold the team and the players to accountability, the preparation will be the same, the identity will be the same, the culture will be the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_graham@on3.com", "name": "Andrew Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Greenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seth Greenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Udonis Haslem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_East_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big East Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/04/03073400/Dan-Hurley-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

This was more than pep rally aggrandizement; it was, in fact, true. That April evening in Phoenix, the University of Connecticut had laid claim to its sixth men's national championship, bettering the banner collections of Duke and Indiana and pulling even with North Carolina.\n\nQuietly, while college basketball clung to its traditional list of bluebloods, the Huskies had amassed more titles in the past 25 years than anyone else, creating a dynasty essentially out of a cow patch. With Hurley -- brash, bold and slightly bananas -- at the helm, UConn appeared impervious to the fickle fates of college athletics, poised for stability while everyone else hopped around the portal as if the basketball court was lava. Storrs, of all places, looked a lot like heaven.\n\nAnd then Thursday, the curtain was yanked down. Storrs revealed itself as an ordinary place, its grasp on nirvana tied entirely to the whims of one man. Folks in the Nutmeg State, accustomed to the terrors of the morning rush hour, instead awoke to the rush of terrorizing news: Hurley was in conversations with the Los Angeles Lakers about becoming their next head coach.\n\nIt should be stressed, underlined, bolded and italicized that nothing is done. These things do not always take. Fourteen years ago, Tom Izzo had a chance to coach LeBron James, now of Hurley's would-be Lakers and then of the Cavaliers, and spent nine days wrestling with the decision before opting to return to Michigan State. On the heels of winning his own back-to-back national titles, Billy Donovan went so far as to have a news conference announcing him as the new head coach of the Orlando Magic, only to get cold feet and return to Florida.\n\nUntil Hurley is truly gone, he is not gone, and it is more than fair to wonder if he is currently floating in one of his sensory deprivation tanks pondering being the king of the college hoops world versus coaching King James. The track record of college coaches in the NBA is pretty scorched Earth, and as a person born and raised in New Jersey, I can personally attest that we do not necessarily translate everywhere, especially in La-La Land\n\nAll that said, let's operate under the notion that the Lakers will throw more money at Hurley than the state of Connecticut can conjure up to assist UConn, and he bolts. What then? Like a double rainbow, what in fact does Hurley leaving mean?\n\nIt means Dave Benedict needs an Advil. The UConn athletic director went to bed on Wednesday night with a baseball team in a super regional, Geno Auriemma inked to a five-year contract extension and Hurley reworking his roster mastery in pursuit of a three-peat. He woke up to an absolute nightmare.\n\nUConn is, despite its efforts to argue to the contrary, a basketball school, and having to possibly either entice the best basketball coach in the sport to remain or find his replacement is less than ideal. Especially on June 6. Benedict can neither afford to make a knee-jerk decision nor take too much time figuring out the Huskies' future. Should Hurley leave, there will be options (there always are options), but this is a hypercritical decision already well beyond the 11th hour on the decision date timeline. A coaching change means players immediately receive a 30-day transfer window. The players who came to Storrs -- and are targeted to come this upcoming season -- are not coming for the bucolic charm of the town. They came to play for Hurley. If he goes, that portal opening will probably look something like the Walmart front doors on Black Friday.\n\nBecause though UConn appeared impervious in the wake of that national title, it is not. The Huskies won three national titles on the sheer will power of a Hall of Fame coach from South Boston, and two more on the sheer will power of a future Hall of Fame coach from Jersey City. College basketball is and always will be about its coaches. Players win games. Coaches win titles. Fit, culture and all of those words people love to throw around have nothing to do with the brick and mortar of a place and everything to do with the guy in charge. That's why you rarely see outliers winning titles. Aside from Kevin Ollie, the list of championship-winning coaches in the past 20 years reads: Hurley, Bill Self, Scott Drew, Tony Bennett, Jay Wright, Roy Williams, Mike Krzyzewski, Rick Pitino, John Calipari, Jim Calhoun, Billy Donovan, Jim Boeheim.\n\nBeyond all of that, the school has legit challenges. The state funding is a mess, and both Gampel Pavilion and the XL Center need a boost. UConn is seeking $100 million from the state to help clean up Gampel.\n\nThe Huskies are, without question, on much steadier ground in the Big East. The move back to the league that allowed for the birth of the basketball program in the first place has factored largely into the UConn rejuvenation. Fans disinterested in watching the likes of Tulsa and East Carolina flocked back for Villanova and St. John's, and then returned jubilantly to the Garden. That gave Hurley something to sell and something to attract recruits.\n\nBut we also are in a new world order. The details and payouts of the looming House settlement need to be worked out, but it isn't likely to be smooth sailing for UConn. The Big East already has been shammed by its football-bloated \"colleagues\" to foot a disproportionate percentage of the bill. This without the league bringing in football revenue. UConn, of course, plays football but as a little revenue-producing independent. Whatever revenue is shared with independents will no doubt be tilted toward a golden-domed school in South Bend.\n\nSome coaches have opined privately to The Athletic that there is potentially a silver lining for the Big East. When the dust settles, the current pay structure gossiped on the vine is a 65/35 division -- meaning 65 percent of the money going to football. The Big East, however, doesn't have to pay out the gridiron roster, which means that a larger percentage of whatever money the conference has can, in fact, go to hoops. And that could be really good math.\n\nBut it is all really tricky math. And there's no obvious solution.\n\nNo man is, of course, irreplaceable. To argue that the Huskies will collapse like a house of cards and disappear is to ignore three decades of history to the contrary. But even before Thursday morning, UConn had its problems. Those problems become infinitely trickier to solve if the Dan Hurley exodus variable is thrown into the equation.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

James informed the Lakers that their next head coach would have to be one that was also a good fit after his exit.\n\n\"When this process started for the Lakers when they dismissed Darvin Ham, they obviously spoke to LeBron about the coaching situation,\" said Brian Windhorst on First Take. \"From what I understand, what LeBron said to them was, 'You have to hire somebody who is for beyond just me. I might be here for another year. I might be here for two years. You've got to make a decision that's built around Anthony Davis. That's built around what the Lakers need for the next decade, not just what I need.'\n\n\"Certainly, his feelings on the head coach are going to be taken into account, but that's the message LeBron gave them. This type of hire this type of going for this type of candidate aligns with that.\n\n\"Secondly, LeBron has praised Dan Hurley and his acumen very recently in public especially after this podcast he did with J.J. Redick. It is incredibly ironic that he just did a podcast right after [Hurley] won the second national title in a row with J.J. talking about X's and O's, talking about where he gets some of his creativity, talking about how he's morphed as a coach. And I do think that is going to be received positively by LeBron.\n\n\"Any coaching person any anybody that the Lakers were looking for in this hire is going to be some level of a risk because there wasn't a bonafide highly proven NBA coach sitting there. The only coach that was really out there that met that criteria was Mike Budenholzer. The Suns moved in on that very quickly and made that hire.\n\n\"Whoever the Lakers were going to hire, they were going to have to step out a little bit of their comfort zone. So that's one of the reasons why you saw J.J. Redick's name attached to it, because they were looking for somebody who had very high potential yeah so if you're going to take a you're going to make a high risk hire, which any coach who never been a head coach in the NBA would be what you want is a high reward. Dan Hurley is a high reward type situation.\"\n\nWindhorst previously added during a spot on Get Up the James didn't suggest they hire Redick.", "source": {"uri": "basketball.realgm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real GM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Take_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Take (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://basketball.realgm.com/images/nba/4.2/wiretap/photos/2006/James_LeBron_lal_240531.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629925", "eventUri": "eng-9629925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Kyle Neptune has failed to lead Villanova back to the NCAA Tournament after Jay Wright retired in 2022 after winning two NCAA championships.\n\nJon Scheyer at Duke and Hubert Davis at North Carolina have enjoyed more success -- with Davis leading the Tar Heels to the 2022 NCAA title game in his first year as coach -- after replacing Hall of Famers Mike Krzyzewski (Duke) and Roy Williams (North Carolina). Wright, Coach K and Williams all left as NIL and the transfer portal have become dominant in college basketball.\n\nGreenberg said Hurley \"has got a legitimate chance of going three in a row and that would be historic\" after winning back-to-back NCAA championships, but conceded that obviously UConn's odds would improve with Hurley on the sidelines.\n\nStill, Greenberg called the Lakers -- along with the Celtics and Knicks -- \"different.\"\n\n\"If he takes the job, it would be a sad day [for college basketball], but for him I think it would be an exciting challenge,\" Greenberg said. \"The dudes loves a challenge. Here's the caveat in this whole thing. His wife [Andrea, a Toms River, N.J. native] will have as big a say in this decision as anyone...He's not taking this job unless they are in it together.\"\n\nHe added the Lakers would be considered a better job than UConn depending on several things.\n\n\"The Lakers is a better job if he can control his infrastructure, if he has a say in personnel,\" Greenberg said. \"In college, you've gotta be connected to your athletic director and your assistant coaches need to know who can play for the head coach.\n\n\"In the NBA, you've gotta be connected to the President and your General Manager/personnel people have to understand who can play for the head coach.\n\nHe added: \"Of course there's going to be a transition. The Lakers need a culture, they need an identity, they need accountability.\"\n\nAs for UConn, the Huskies got a major boost when Alex Karaban withdrew from the NBA Draft and opted to return for his junior season. He joins returners Hassan Diarra, Samson Johnson, Solo Ball, Jaylin Stewart, Jayden Ross and Yousouff Singare.\n\n\"We think, top to bottom, this could be our most talented roster,\" Hurley said last month.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

ESPN was first to report the news. Here's what you need to know:\n\nHurley's initial task was to return UConn to prominence. He inherited a program with a lost identity and stuck in a flounder conference. He then led the program's transition back to the Big East, ramped up his recruiting from East Coast-centric to national, made the program a contender in the league, and then took it all the way to the top.\n\nHurley is probably one of the 5-10 best coaches in college today and UConn can rest easy that he won't jump to the NBA. That's not a fit. What the school needs to do is keep him away from any other powerhouse that might come calling. Thus, pay the man. Heading into 2023-24, UConn should keep right on rolling despite heavy attrition from last year's national title team. The roster is built around potential All-American Donovan Clingan and will be among the favorites in the Big East. -- Quinn\n\nConnecticut hired Hurley ahead of the 2018-19 season after his prior head-coaching stints at Rhode Island (2012-18) and Wagner (2010-12). During his tenure, the Huskies have gone 104-55 and made three NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\nThis spring, Hurley became the third coach in program history to win a national championship, joining Jim Calhoun and Kevin Ollie.\n\nHurley has amassed a 255-160 overall record in 13 Division I seasons.

There is an opening once again, so who do the odds favor to take over as the 29th coach in the storied franchise's history?\n\nThe position has been a carousel in recent years. There hasn't been a single coach remain in the post for more than three years since Phil Jackson (2005 to 2011). The fact remains, though, it's a dream job for many.

Los Angeles Lakers next coach: JJ Reddick or Dan Hurley?\n\nFormer NBA star JJ Reddick has been the betting favorite in recent weeks after he emerged as the frontrunner for the job. DraftKings Sportsbook listed him as a -210 favorite as recently as June 5. Despite his lack of experience as a coach, he's viewed as an interesting candidate with an adept basketball mind.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego (+400) and Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell (+800) were the only other names with shorter than 10/1 odds to take over in Los Angeles.\n\nThe list put out by DraftKings was extensive and covered all bases. This includes the aforementioned favorites down to candidates out of left field, such as Rajon Rondo (+2000) and Pau Gasol (+20000). However, one name emerged as a favorite on Thursday that even stunned oddsmakers.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the Lakers are targeting Connecticut's Dan Hurley to be their next head coach. The franchise is \"preparing a massive, long-term contract offer\" for one of the most respected coaches in the college game, according to Woj.\n\nHurley's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 speaks for itself as a back-to-back national champion with the Huskies. If there was one job in basketball that could lure him away from Storrs, it's likely the vacant position in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Lakers would be taking a huge risk if they hired Hurley.\n\nCollege coaches have traditionally fared poorly when making the jump into the NBA. The Cleveland Cavaliers' John Beilein is the most recent example on a long list of flops that includes John Calipari, Leonard Hamilton and Lon Kruger.\n\nHowever, one of the most successful coaches to transition from college to the NBA is Billy Donovan. Earlier this year, Hurley became the first coach to win back-to-back NCAA titles since Donovan's Florida teams in 2006 and 2007. The parallels are there and the optimism should be too, if Hurley is the man that Los Angeles ends up hiring. After all, there has been more success lately with coaches of this ilk in Brad Stevens and Donovan.\n\nDraftKings removed its odds to fill the vacant position following the reports that the Lakers were looking into hiring Hurley. His name won't be found on the board below for that reason. Nevertheless, he can be considered one of the favorites along with Reddick as of June 6.\n\nHere are the latest odds for the Los Angeles Lakers' next coach via DraftKings Sportsbook as of June 5, 2024:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers' next head coach odds\n\nJJ Reddick -210\n\nJames Borrego +400\n\nSam Cassell +800\n\nKenny Atkinson +1200\n\nMicah Nori +1200\n\nChris Quinn +1500\n\nDavid Adelman

The Connecticut players have finished reviewing film but have yet to shuffle in from the practice facility across the street. Dan Hurley stands a few steps behind halfcourt. He's wearing gray sweats, a hoodie, a UConn beanie and a pair of reflector sunglasses. He would like it noted that he wore the sunglasses \"way before Coach Prime.''\n\nHurley starts launching halfcourt shots, cursing under his breath when the first few attempts clank off the backboard or, worse, airball short of the basket entirely. The Huskies stream in, clomping down the stairs to the court, and Hurley, still in his getup, keeps shooting.\n\nFinally, the ball swishes through the net and Hurley shouts, to no one in particular and everyone on hand, \"Who's the king of two in a row?\" Ever obedient, star center Donovan Clingan yells back, \"You are, Coach.\"\n\nHurley never swishes back-to-back shots. That doesn't mean he can't be king.\n\nIt has been 17 years since a college basketball team has won consecutive national championships, the pursuit of back-to-back coronations becoming increasingly elusive as the sport dynamics have shifted. Not only has no team matched Florida's two-year run, no defending champion has so much as carried the No. 1 ranking into February since the Gators.\n\nUntil now. Until UConn. A year after dusting NCAA Tournament opponents by an average of 20 points per game en route to the 2023 title, the Huskies are potentially, and frighteningly, even more capable.\n\nThat UConn team limped through the end of December and into January, losing five of six before finding its footing; this UConn team spent five games without Clingan, arguably its most critical player, and dropped not a game. The Huskies are 23-2, have won 13 in a row and rank fourth in the NET rankings. They've held their last 10 opponents to an average 60 points per game. All five starters average double figures, and they can go a reliable eight deep.\n\nAll this when such dynasty building is meant to be impossible, when the NBA Draft and the transfer portal rob teams of roster continuity, and name, image and likeness opportunities allegedly destroy locker room harmony. The Huskies were hardly immune to the sport's passing fancies. Three of UConn's players turned pro after last season, and another transferred out. The Huskies brought Cam Spencer from Rutgers to the team and promptly made him their starting point guard, and one player (Clingan), who has a marketing deal with Dunkin, has profited off his NIL far more than his teammates.\n\nYet here are the Huskies, in position to be the kings of two in a row.\n\nParked off to the side of the court, an easel holds a poster board with a picture of the Big East regular-season trophy. The Huskies cart the easel everywhere they go, changing the picture depending on what trophy they are pursuing. Earlier it depicted the Empire Classic trophy, followed by the Seattle Tip-Off Classic trophy. At some point, the conference tournament trophy will make an appearance, followed by the NCAA regional and so forth.\n\nThe poster, however, looks like it went through a bad day with airport baggage handlers. It's dented in the middle. There's even a small chunk missing at the bottom.\n\nHurley will tell you that he is more Zen, if not less superstitious. He walks into his office, sidestepping a blue-and-white fleece shirt still in its packaging. It has sat on the floor in the middle of the hallway for weeks because the Huskies have not lost since someone dumped it there. Hurley admits the foolishness of this while carrying an Echo Go+, which looks like a lava lamp cross-pollinated with a mini blender. Hurley presses a button on the gizmo that retails for $250 and blue lights swirl, creating alleged hydrogen-heavy water that is said to reduce oxidative stress, improve gut health, sleep and energy, all while helping to reverse the signs of aging. Later Hurley sends a text, extolling the virtues of the sensory deprivation tank he visits for 90 minutes, and how it's helped with his \"mental reset.''\n\nHe says this mostly tongue in cheek - \"I'm f -- -- Benjamin Button,'' he jokes as he chugs the water - but not entirely. He does believe he has found an inner peace and harmony that has helped cut down his on-court histrionics. Hurley has been hit with technicals this season, but has yet to be ejected from a game. Progress.\n\nExcept there's the poster board. The dents, nicks and missing chunks came courtesy of Hurley whizzing a ball at the picture when his UConn players did not practice to the standards he deems necessary to win.\n\nAsked if Hurley is more intense this year, pursuing a second championship, or last year aiming for his first, neither Clingan nor Alex Karaban allow the question to be completed before answering. \"Oh, this is way worse,'' Karaban says. \"He's way harder on us this year. The intensity in practice, it's just through the roof every day.''\n\nIt is hard to gauge the difference, since a Hurley-run practice is never a picnic. There have never been scheduled water breaks or even opportunities to sit down. The Huskies, in fact, are not permitted to bend over at the waist when they're tired. Hurley offers up some physiological reasoning, about expanded chests improving breathing, but then he gets to the heart of it. \"Weakness,'' he says. \"That's just a sign of weakness.'' When Clingan, returning after nearly a month off, begins to bend over, Gavin Roberts, the team's director of sports performance, rushes to his side. \"No, no, no,'' he says. \"Don't do that.''\n\nMinor infractions merit banishment to stair runs, the punishment so indoctrinated in the Huskies that when Hurley lays into Youssouf Singare for bad defense, Singare just turns and runs the steps without even being told. And despite buzzwords plastered in the practice facility declaring one of UConn's tenets as \"mindful communication,\" there is little mind to how things are communicated. Were the Huskies to position a swear jar in the building, they'd likely not need a collective to fund their NIL.\n\nElsewhere there might be wiggle room gifted to veteran players who helped you win a title a year ago. Here, there is less tolerance for even the smallest of transgressions. Hurley pounces on Clingan for failing to cover a shooter in transition. \"I know you're mad at me,'' he yells. \"Don't be mad at me for being honest.'' After a bad entry pass from Karaban, Hurley covers his eyes for an entire minute, too pained to watch as practice continues. Stephon Castle, the consensus ninth-best freshman, is chastised for a bad pass, lazy defense, poor decision-making and shot selection. After a bad defensive possession, associate head coach Kimani Young laments, \"We never make plays on defense. Never. When are we going to?\" The Huskies, it should be noted, are 18th in KenPom defensive rankings.\n\nFinally, as the blue team (starters) gets smoked by the gray team - with chip off the block/walk-on Andrew Hurley goading the starters \"Whipping that ass, blue,''- the Hurley in charge shouts, \"Champions don't do that sh-.'' In his office later, Hurley sits on a sofa and plays armchair psychiatrist. He thinks maybe he's so demanding as a coach because he's trying to make up for what he failed to achieve as a player. He also digs into the psychoanalysis of what winning a title does to a man. \"When you haven't done it, you can't tell me you know you can do it,\" Hurley says. \"You can think you have a great team, but you can't be 1,000 percent confident that you can coach a team through six teams in the hardest tournament in the country and win. Now for us, we know deep down as a program, we can. I go home, I look at pictures in my basement and you think about how great it was. But then you also think, 'Man, I just want to do it again.'\"\n\nWhat's notable is how the Huskies respond to him. Sit in enough college basketball practices and it becomes easy to read body language. Slumped shoulders, eyes cast to the floor and backs turned are the universal signs that the coach might still be yelling, but the accused no longer hears what he's saying.\n\nThe Huskies take Hurley's heat without so much as a grimace. They either beat him to the punch and own the mistake before he points it out, or stare him dead in the eye as he delivers his withering evaluation. They run up and down the stairs and jump back into work. Over and over again.\n\nThe Huskies don't merely put up with Hurley's intensity; they crave it.\n\nKaraban is down three TVs. Video games, it should be noted, do not always behave the way you intend, which is especially troubling if you have an analytical mind that prefers order and proper response. Karaban has such a mind. He is the son of a Ukrainian immigrant mother who has a doctorate from Northeastern, and a Belarussian immigrant father who works as a software engineer. Karaban likes math and is chasing what UConn calls an 'individualized major,'' wherein he has combined three majors - computer science, sports management and statistics - into one hellacious, numbers-focused pursuit.\n\nSo nerdy is Karaban - his mother made him revisit UConn because she thought the first tour didn't have enough info about academics - that Hurley worried \"his socks would turn yellow'' when placed in front of crowds of angry basketball fans. In the first game of his career, Karaban scored 13, yanked down four boards, and dished out three assists. His socks were just fine. \"It's like he's a superhero, or something,'' Hurley marvels. \"Like he has an alter ego.'' Said alter ego surfaced this summer, when the misbehaving video games failed to do what Karaban intended. He tried to throw the remote at the wall but his aim isn't as good as his shooting stroke. The thing went through the TV, clocking the screen so badly that it became unwatchable. \"Yeah, it happened three times,'' Karaban says sheepishly.\n\nAfter losing to UConn earlier this month, St. John's head coach Rick Pitino went on a classic misdirection rant about the foibles of the NCAA enforcement process, its struggles to properly govern NIL and the impossible roster churn that the portal presents. \"You can't build programs and culture,'' the Hall of Fame coach concluded, echoing a refrain heard a lot this season as teams struggle to find continuity.\n\nThe Huskies would like a word. \"We all try to emulate Coach's style,'' says Tristen Newton. \"No fat ruts, that's what he tells us. You can't eat and get comfortable. We're all on that same page.''\n\nDid they only get to said page thanks to Hurley's stiff-arm? The Huskies will tell you no, that they came to Storrs from varied directions but each in search of what he delivered. Newton is a one-time unheralded recruit who had but one college offer - East Carolina - and opted to leave after his coach was fired. He liked UConn for its singularity of focus - he laments that the nearest Chick Fil-A is 30 minutes away - and recognized that Hurley would push him out of his comfort zone. \"I'm more laid-back,'' he says. \"I needed to be pushed.''\n\nKaraban's parents used to shoo him outdoors in the Massachusetts' winters to play basketball. Spencer is a Hurley mini-me, who cusses himself out over mistakes to the point that the coach tells him to calm down, and Clingan, a delightfully kind, ego-less star, lost his mom at 14 and was raised by a single dad who works as a utility worker. He understands the idea of hard work and sacrifice. \"You have to be a kid who wants coaching, old-school coaching, like people who will squeeze every absolute ounce out of a player,\" he says. \"Not everybody wants that. They say they do, but they really don't.\"\n\nHurley is neither the first nor the only coach to key in on what works for him and recruit to that fit. Jay Wright memorably pivoted his entire recruiting philosophy after a 2009 Final Four run turned into a dismal 13-19 season three years later. Matt Painter regrouped so entirely that he now asks recruits to take personality assessments to ensure that they suit him. But it is, to Pitino's point, getting harder to build a base. The Huskies have been fairly fortunate. Only four players in the last two years have left, allowing the staff to use the portal to fill needs and not restock wholesale. Of the three transfers on the current roster - Newton, Spencer and Hassan Diarra (Texas A&M), only Spencer will visit campus for one year.\n\nBut it's not like UConn's road has been without issue. Castle missed six games with a knee injury, slowing the freshman phenom's start. Then Clingan, who battled foot problems in the preseason, exited a game against Seton Hall with an injury to the same foot. \"What was I thinking?\" Hurley says. \"Oh, sh-.\" Fair reaction. Clingan may not garner the same attention as Zach Edey, but he is as critical to the Huskies as Edey is to Purdue. The 7-footer draws natural attention inside, creating open shots for the wings, and is a defensive vacuum.\n\nClingan went back to his room feeling much the same as his coach. His foot throbbed for a good three or four days, every step feeling like he was walking on a bed of needles. He was terrified his season was over. When doctors said instead that he would only need a handful of weeks to recover, the sophomore nearly erupted with relief. Clingan is, by nature, a giver, and the attention he received as the returning key cog to a national championship team in his home state (he's from Bristol) did not always fit snugly. \"He's the most unselfish person I've ever met,\" says Karaban, his roommate. \"He's always looking to help you, with rides, getting you food, buying you stuff. He hates receiving stuff.\" That, no doubt, added to his rush to return from the preseason injury. He admits now that he rushed his recovery, starting back to work when he still had some lingering pain, which made him less productive early in the season than he hoped to be.\n\nThis time, he vowed to be a more patient patient. He followed the methodical plan, while also using the break to streamline his body. He cut out late-night snacks and exchanged sports drinks for water, leaning out his frame. \"I tried to cheer on the bench, and not jump,'' he says with a laugh. \"It was a long four weeks.''\n\nAround the country, top-ranked teams with fewer problems lost bad games, road games, home games and close games. The Huskies upped Samson Johnson's minutes and even rotated Karaban to the five to cover for Clingan's absence.\n\nThey didn't lose a game.\n\nSomewhere between chastising Clingan for his transition defense and insisting that the entire organization will fail because of one errant pass, Hurley goes to midcourt and starts heaving shots again. This is not entirely out of character. Lost in the translation of how hard Hurley rides his team is how much fun he has with them. He hops into drills, smack talks, and cuts the tension with one-line zingers that leave the players covering their mouths with their jerseys so as not to get in trouble for laughing.\n\nTo wit: He has decided sophomore Apostolos Roumoglou resembles a James Bond villain. When the extraordinarily chatty Roumoglou protests a foul call, Hurley barks at him. \"Hey, GoldenEye, get over here.'\"\n\nSays Clingan, \"I swear sometimes he says funny things so you laugh and then he can yell at you for laughing.'' He's asked if this is a form of entrapment. \"Yeah, exactly,'' he says. \"Entrapment.''\n\nSo when, mid-rant, Hurley stops to hurl halfcourt shots, no one seems surprised. They just wait. Hurley swishes a shot and yells, 'Who's the king of two in a row?'\" At least four people yell back, \"You are.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dana_o_neil@nytimes.com", "name": "Dana O'Neil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurley,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurley, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hurley, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Clingan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Clingan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_East_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big East Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Gampel_Pavilion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry A.

I suppose because Dan Hurley had come out and said he wouldn't be coaching any other program besides UConn, I had let my guard down, completely ignoring the fact that the NBA could very easily come calling. And it's not just the NBA. It's the league's most prestigious franchise. The white whale. The same franchise that nearly lured Coach K away from Duke back in 2004.\n\nNow, in the immediate aftermath of this story breaking, I've put together a list of potential coaches who could (gulp) replace Dan Hurley at UConn if he were to leave.\n\nFive Under the Radar Options\n\nAmir Abdur-Rahim (South Florida) - The younger brother of former NBA All-Star and current G-League President Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Amir has compiled at 51-17 record the last two seasons while serving as the head coach at Kennesaw State and South Florida, leading the Owls to their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance and the Bulls to their first Top 25 ranking.\n\nBob Richey (Furman) - The 41-year-old Richey has been the head coach at Furman for seven seasons, and each year the Paladins have finished the season with a winning record, including five years with at least 22 wins. Under Richey's guidance, Furman upset Virginia in the opening round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament, their first tourney win in 49 years.\n\nEric Henderson (South Dakota State) - In each of Henderson's first three years with the program, the Jackrabbits were ranked in the top twenty of offensive efficiency. In five seasons at South Dakota State, Henderson is a four-time Summit League regular season champion, with two NCAA Tournament appearances on his resume as well.\n\nPhil Martelli Jr. (Bryant) - The son of legendary Saint Joseph's head coach Phil Martelli Sr., Martelli Jr. has only been the head coach at Bryant for one season, taking over for previous coach Jared Grasso a week and a half into the season last year. But Martelli Jr. made his impact felt immediately, leading the Bulldogs to an upset win at Florida Atlantic just five days after getting the job. Martelli's roots are in the Northeast, so just geographically, this could be a nice fit.\n\nCasey Alexander (Belmont) - Tasked with taking over at Belmont following the departure of 33-year coaching veteran Rick Byrd, the Bruins didn't take a step backwards under Casey Alexander. Though Belmont hasn't made an NCAA Tournament appearance during Alexander's tenure (they would've in 2020 had the NCAA Tournament not been canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic), they have won at least twenty games in each of those five seasons.\n\nFour Big-ish Names\n\nFrank Martin (UMass) / Thad Matta (Butler) - Frank Martin and Thad Matta were two of the three final candidates to take over the UConn Huskies program in 2018, along with Dan Hurley, who ultimately got the job. It would make sense that UConn would potentially circle back to these two seasoned head coaches if Hurley were to take the Lakers coaching job.\n\nSteve Pikiell (Rutgers) - Pikiell may not seem like a big name, but the Rutgers head coach has roots in Connecticut -- he's from Bristol -- and he has a track record of success. The Scarlett Knights' back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances in 2021 and 2022 marked only the second time in program history that Rutgers went dancing in consecutive years. Perhaps most importantly, Pikiell has proven to be a solid recruiter, leading Rutgers to the 3rd-best recruiting class heading into the 2024 season.\n\nWill Wade (McNeese State) - Once upon a time Will Wade was one of the hottest coaching names in the country, but violations while at LSU set his coaching career back. Now, Wade has found success while at McNeese State, but it's only a matter of time until a major program comes calling. Why not UConn?\n\nThree UConn Assistants\n\nLuke Murray / Tom Moore / Kimani Young - It remains to be seen whether any members of the UConn staff would join Hurley in LA if he were to take the Lakers job, but if they didn't this would be my preferred direction that they go. Luke Murray -- the son of legendary actor Bill Murray -- has been credited as the man, along with Hurley, responsible for helping to turn the Huskies offense into one of the most beautiful and intricate in the country. Tom Moore has spent twenty years on the UConn bench as an assistant, under both Jim Calhoun and Dan Hurley. But Kimani Young, a former player at UTEP and a Queens, New York native, may be the favorite to land the job if Hurley were to leave. Young is listed as the Associate Head Coach of the team, and has been largely responsible for recruiting and developing players such as Tristen Newton, Stephon Castle and Jordan Hawkins.\n\nTwo Drew Brothers\n\nScott Drew (Baylor) / Bryce Drew (Grand Canyon) - Scott Drew recently turned down a chance to take the Kentucky job, so the Baylor head coach may not be in play here, but his younger brother could very much be in play. Bryce Drew has led Grand Canyon to three NCAA Tournament appearances in the last four years, and he had tremendous success at Valparaiso, his alma mater, prior to that. His three-year stop at Vanderbilt wasn't as successful, though Drew did lead Vandy to an NCAA Tournament appearance in his first year with the school.\n\nOne Big Name\n\nNate Oats (Alabama) - Much like DJ Khaled, all Nate Oats does is win, accumulating a 213-97 record in nine seasons as a head coach. Oats led the University of Buffalo to a school record 32 wins in 2019, and took Alabama to their only Final Four in program history last year. And don't forget, Oats has a connection to the Hurley family. He got his Division I start as an assistant under Dan Hurley's brother Bobby Hurley at Buffalo.\n\nIf Dan Hurley leaves UConn, then the \"Best College Basketball Coach Alive\" championship belt might be heading to Nate Oats. So why shouldn't he be coaching The Best College Basketball Program in the country?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But here's what else this move would be: Yet another damaging gut punch to the sport of college basketball.\n\nIn recent years, the sport has seen four iconic coaches - you know the names - take their combined 11 national titles and retire or step aside: Jay Wright, Jim Boeheim, Mike Krzyzewski and Roy Williams.\n\nThe sport lacks the star power, much less the star power that remains in school multiple years, that helped it carve out a special niche in the American sporting culture in the 1980s and '90s, and not just in three weeks in March.\n\nBut the connective tissue was the coaches, with their stature, gravitas and unique personas.\n\nMuch of that has been lost. And that's not even taking into account the significant losses of excellent game coaches like Billy Donovan, Brad Stevens and John Beilein, all of whom reached multiple Final Fours - and in Donovan's case won two national titles - before leaving for the NBA.\n\nDan Hurley - a skilled game tactician who has excelled in player development - in many ways is a throwback. Ultra intense, much like his dad, but with a quirky side, Hurley, 51, is an old-school guy thriving in a new-school world.\n\nHe has repeatedly said he never wanted NIL to be the primary reason why players choose to play for the Huskies, now winners of a remarkable six national titles since 1999. He wants players who want to play for him, in his demanding program, and at a school that is now basketball royalty.\n\nYet he is not averse to diving head-first into the transfer portal, navigating it successfully and having a little fun with the maddening process that is now a reality for all national title hopefuls. Check out his playful, angst-ridden post on social media the day the spring portal window opened.\n\nDespite the histrionics, there is a method to Dan Hurley's madness.\n\nThe top two scorers on UConn's national title team this past season - Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer - were both transfers. And UConn scored a coup this spring when it landed talented guard Aidan Mahaney, who had earned All-West Coast Conference honors at Saint Mary's.\n\nBut a seismic change to the collegiate ecosystem awaits: a revenue-sharing model is expected to take hold as early as fall 2025.\n\nAs part of the House v. NCAA settlement - if approved by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken - schools, at their discretion, will be able to share as much as $22 million annually with athletes.\n\nEven many schools in the power conferences are grappling with budget implications related to needing to share as much as $22 million with athletes to remain competitive on the field or the court.\n\nBut in a football-driven world, UConn competes as an independent. Its Big East membership in other sports, notably men's and women's basketball, yields only $4-5 million annually.\n\nIn the days leading up to the approval of the House settlement terms, Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman wrote in an email that she strongly opposed conferences having to foot a large chunk of the $2.8 billion damages bill in the House case even though they were not named power five conference defendants.\n\nIn a revenue-sharing world, even UConn basketball will be swimming upstream.\n\nConsider this admission from UConn Athletic Director David Benedict, who told CTInsider.com: \"Honestly, we would never spend up to the cap. We don't generate enough money to spend up to the cap. Part of this will be driven by the market, like everything else.\"\n\nThere is no indication how, if at all, revenue-sharing challenges on the horizon are factoring into Dan Hurley's decision. But it is a new reality that Hurley would confront if he remains at UConn.\n\nAnyone who loves college basketball is anxiously awaiting his decision.

Hat backwards. AirPods in place. Sleep-deprived and right on time for Final Four obligations.\n\n\"I'm heeeeeeeeeeeere,\" Hurley declared to a familiar face as he passed by.\n\nThis was not the first update on the Huskies' whereabouts Thursday, though it was probably the least convoluted.\n\nA charter aircraft that never arrived from Kansas City. A replacement with mechanical issues. Inclement weather and a prolonged de-icing procedure. Lots of incremental online updates, wheels up six hours later than expected and an NCAA statement emailed out at 3:27 a.m.: UConn MBB Has Arrived In Phoenix.\n\nPlane annoying, in other words.\n\n\"Who doesn't deal with problems with the airlines?\" Hurley said with a smile during his Thursday news conference. \"It's something you gotta get through. But it sucked.\"\n\nTo recap: Mechanical issues grounded UConn's original charter flight to Arizona. Then inclement weather compounded another mechanical issue on the replacement aircraft, creating another two-hour delay getting out of Bradley International Airport in Connecticut. Wheels up time went from an originally planned 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. The Huskies eventually landed at 3:12 a.m. local time.\n\n\"An unfortunate set of circumstances,\" is how the NCAA's early Thursday morning statement put it.\n\nAsked how he passed the time, Hurley went full deadpan. \"I ruminated,\" the Huskies coach said. \"A lot. I spiraled. I had my head in my hand a lot. ... It was a real mindful exercise from 11:30 to like 1:45 on the tarmac. It was therapeutic to watch the de-icing. That was probably the best part of it.\"\n\nUnderstandably, the media schedule for the players was shuffled to accommodate recovery from the delays, with an open locker room session canceled on Thursday. Beyond that? Hurley said he made do with two hours of sleep on the plane and two at the hotel.\n\n\"That's why God made caffeine,\" he said, but only backed off a bit on his team's preparation.\n\n\"We pushed things back a little bit, maybe like an hour and 15 (minutes),\" Hurley said. \"The guys were able to sleep in a little bit. We did our same routine. We did our video at the hotel. We knew we only had an hour and a half on the court, so it was important to take advantage of shooting, get a little bit of live play so we could get adjusted to a much, much bigger setting. We obviously took a little bit off the practice plan. Just make sure that we do a little bit less tonight, let these guys get their rest.\n\n\"I mean, listen, these guys were getting in a van driving 14 hours to the Peach Jam, playing two hours later.

The extreme degree of difficulty might also be why Dan Hurley and Connecticut are so perfectly wired for the pursuit.\n\n\"The bigness of what you're trying to do,\" Hurley says, \"is intoxicating.\"\n\nHis Huskies rampaged through the regular season, ripped through the Big East tournament and thrashed their first four NCAA Tournament opponents. They now sit two wins away from joining Donovan's Gators and Mike Krzyzewski's 1991-92 Duke as the third back-to-back champs in the modern era, in part because Hurley was never going to be happy with just the one. In fact, when he called Donovan, an old friend now coaching the NBA's Chicago Bulls, soon after winning last year's title, it wasn't in search of the how-to handbook for repeating.\n\n\"I crashed emotionally,\" Hurley says. \"It didn't feel as great as I thought. The pursuit felt better than the accomplishment. The pursuit is what's addictive. Being part of a group that's pursuing is addictive. I just didn't like the s -- as much as I thought I would, the victory lap. What you discover is you love the f -- ing work more than you love staring at a banner or cutting down a net. When that stuff ends, you're saying, 'Where's the mission?'\"\n\nHe called Donovan because he needed to hear that he wasn't crazy for feeling this way.\n\n\"I told him I'd gone through the same,\" Donovan says. \"I don't want to say depression -- that's the wrong word -- but there is this melancholy of, like, 'What is my purpose? I wanted to get to this point, I got there, and now what?'\n\n\"I always go back to a '60 Minutes' interview with Tom Brady, after he won his third Super Bowl, when he was like, 'Is this all there is?' It's really hard to find somebody that you can talk to, that's been through it, that can understand what it's like after. Because when the confetti stops falling and the parade is over, you're left sitting there going, 'What am I supposed to do next?'\"\n\nFor men like Hurley and Donovan, whose father and father figures, respectively, were Naismith Hall of Fame coaches Bob Hurley Sr. and Rick Pitino, the next step is simple: chase another championship. Whether you actually capture it is not really the point.\n\n\"You learn a lot about yourself in the chase,\" Donovan says. \"You learn why you're really doing this. What I learned was when you're part of something greater than yourself -- or even if you're just trying to achieve something great -- you can't do it by yourself. When you understand the level of commitment and sacrifice that goes into that, if you apply that to your marriage, to your kids, to your relationships, you make the people around you better, and you make yourself better.\"\n\nSo after the post-championship blues wore off and the thrill of trying to make history started to kick in, Hurley got back on the phone with Donovan. He wanted to know if there were any secrets to repeating -- and what storms were coming, because he suspected defending a title would be far trickier than winning that first one. For an extra challenge, Hurley would be trying to do it despite losing five of his top seven players, including three NBA Draft picks, off the 2023 championship team. Donovan had the unprecedented luxury of returning his top seven players, including eventual top-10 picks Al Horford, Corey Brewer and Joakim Noah.\n\nThere was a built-in chemistry for those Gators, an unspoken selflessness.\n\n\"Everybody says to me all the time, 'Man, how'd you get those guys to come back? They were all lottery picks.'\" Donovan says. \"You know why they came back? They came back because they didn't want to leave (fellow starter) Taurean Green behind, because he wasn't going to get drafted after that first championship. They came back because they wanted to help him in his career. That's why we won. That's it right there. Those guys had a level of sacrifice for one another that three of them would bypass millions and millions of dollars for a teammate.\"\n\nHurley didn't have that level of brotherhood baked into his roster, but he didn't exactly start from scratch either. He had a four-man nucleus of legitimate contributors from the title team -- Tristen Newton, Alex Karaban, Donovan Clingan and Hassan Diarra -- and he plugged holes with very high-end talent: coveted transfer Cam Spencer, five-star freshman Stephon Castle and two more top-50 recruits. There would be plenty of good pieces, so the only question was how well they'd fit.\n\nPerfectly, as it turns out.\n\n\"We just have people that are desperate to win more,\" Hurley says. \"We have 'we' guys. We have also talked about legacy. These guys right now are leaving a legacy in a place that's hard to leave a legacy. It's been a historical season in a tough place to make history. They're galvanized by that.\"\n\nLesser men might also be gobbled up by it. When you're steamrolling toward a seemingly inevitable second consecutive national championship, when you've won 55 of your last 60 games, when you've won 10 straight NCAA Tournament games by double digits, one might be forgiven for feeling an enormous sense of growing pressure not to screw it up just shy of the finish line. Or maybe arrogance, that no one could possibly derail this train now. Or perhaps division, as outsiders begin to nitpick the juggernaut and single out which players are most important to the pursuit. Donovan warned Hurley about this.\n\n\"He was so big on the external,\" Hurley says. \"The disease of me. The old Pat Riley thing, 'The Winner Within,' right? Just really trying to root out in your culture any signs of petty jealousy, one player being promoted more than the others, rooting out any type of behavior, mindset, whispering in the organization that will destroy what we have right now. We're not guaranteed to win another championship, but we have championship culture, and we want to keep that intact.\"\n\nDonovan remembers how America fell in love with Joakim Noah's big personality during the first championship run, then decided he was a villain in the sequel. There's some of that happening with Hurley right now. He's the same sideline-stomping, referee-cursing, chest-thumping madman he ever was, but his audacity hits different now that he's the reigning king, not some sneaky usurper.\n\nLed by Hurley repeatedly calling his team \"bulletproof\" and talking about smacking every opponent so far in this tournament, \"our players have a lot of swagger,\" he says, \"and our fan base is obnoxious as s -- on social (media), so everyone hates us.\" So long as that fuels the Huskies without consuming them, Donovan sees no problem there.\n\n\"There are a ton of distractions that come with trying to do it again,\" Donovan says. \"But I didn't think our guys felt pressure. I think our guys leaned into that. Because that's who we were, a bunch of competitors. That's one thing I'll say for Danny: He's real and authentic and genuine to who he is. If he's saying things about what a dominant team he's got, it's because he truly believes it, and he wants his team to believe it too. Bob Knight, Dean Smith, Rick Pitino, Nolan Richardson, they all won championships with different styles of play and very different personalities.\n\n\"I think that's what makes great coaches great, that they stay true to who they are, because when your players see or feel like you've changed because of the moment, that's not good.\"\n\nOne area in which Hurley has never deviated: grueling practices. Donovan, a Pitino disciple who would scoff at what most consider a difficult workout, notes that times have changed and sometimes pushing players to their breaking point is frowned upon anymore. Hurley could not possibly care less.\n\n\"If you go there, you know what you're walking into,\" Donovan says. \"The practices have to be harder than the games. They just have to be if you want to be great. Danny understands that if they can get through the adversity inside of practice, they're gonna get through the adversity inside of games. Sometimes coaches are perceived to be 'punishing' players in practice, when it's not really punishment. It's getting them to understand that they have to be prepared for the most difficult situations, so that when those moments hit, they lean into those moments; they don't back away from them.\"\n\nThat's why Hurley is fairly dismissive of a frequently asked question: What happens if Connecticut, with the gaudy 35-3 record and very few close calls all season, finds itself in a tight game with the national championship hanging in the balance?\n\n\"We've played under pressure on a daily basis,\" he says, \"because our practice is very intense.\"\n\nThe result is beautiful basketball, played with so much effort it looks effortless, with so much style it looks like a party, with so little stress it looks like nirvana. If actually winning the championship isn't Hurley's purpose, maybe it's this: to relentlessly pursue hard things, and teach young men to do hard things, until they're easy.\n\n\"I love watching them play, because they play connected, they look like they're having fun out there,\" says Green, starting point guard on both those Florida title teams. \"The joy they play with, the way they're dialed into the scout, focused on every possession, it's all those little things we had that you can see in UConn.\"\n\n\"This was the hardest part, getting to the Final Four,\" Horford says. \"Once they get there, I feel like they know what to do. I thought their biggest challenge would be early in the tournament -- and they ran through that. So just keep doing what they do and they should be fine.\"\n\nGreen remembers that before Florida began its title defense, Donovan gathered the team and told them they were no longer on top of the mountain. That they'd be starting back from the bottom, and they couldn't take the same, well-worn path to the top. That there would be a new route and new obstacles, \"so just embrace the journey and live in the moment.\" Hurley gave his team a similar message in the preseason. \"Since June, we've worked like we haven't won anything,\" he says, \"and I think that's the secret sauce.\"\n\nDonovan has become something of an expert on sports figures who are addicted to chasing greatness. He quotes Tiger Woods on his insatiable appetite for winning. But he offers one last word of advice for anyone in the throes of that particular affliction, courtesy of his friend and renowned performance psychologist, Dr. Jim Loehr.\n\n\"He said everybody's chasing something, and there's nothing wrong with chasing,\" Donovan recalls. \"But what is the chase turning you into? Is it turning you into a better coach, better person, better husband, better father? Or is it creating something in you that you despise? To me, it's all about the struggle inside of that chase with other people who are committed to each other. These opportunities to do what they're trying to do, if viewed the right way, can build incredible characteristics to help you be very successful in every aspect of your life. The tricky part is keeping that in proper perspective.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_tucker@nytimes.com", "name":

BUt why would Hurley leave a basketball power after two straight titles and being poised for a third?\n\nWerll, the changing landscape of college athletics and, it is the Lakers after all.\n\n\"I think it comes down and can be distilled by one succinct point. Why play in a league and coach in a league and run a team in a league that is a quasi professional league that's figuring it out when you can actually go to an established professional league and coach in that league that has it figured out,\" Thamel said on Get Up.\n\n\"That has its TV contracts lined up that has its business in order that isn't subject to the whims of random court cases and sporadic enforcement. College sports are professional sports, but they are not as well run and they're not as distinct as the established American professional sports.\"\n\nHurley is in a landscape where college athletics are no longer amateurism. And who knows what UConn basketball means in the grand scheme of things as college transitions to whatever pro model?\n\n\"So as we're making this transition to quasi professional and losing the amateur status, you could obviously argue it was lost long ago,\" Thamel said. \"The rules of engagement are just cloudy right now. Clear as mud is what a bunch of SEC ADs and presidents told me about the future of college athletics in Destin. So you can either you can either coach and work and clear as mud or you can go to a place where the bottom line is very simple.\n\n\"The reporting structure is very clear in the future, especially looking at a place like UConn that doesn't have big time football as a driver. (And) doesn't have the TV contracts that the SEC and the Big Ten have, the future there is going to be difficult to project.\"\n\nSure, hurley is at a basketball power where UConn runs the athletic department compared to football. But what if football breaks away?

Hard to believe, right? After all, it's been an entire week since we saw a game in the National Basketball Association. The Celtics swept the Pacers and the Mavericks won in five. Despite the quick conference finals, Adam Silver did not feel the need to expedite the start of the NBA Finals, giving us a seven-day basketball drought that finally reaches an end tonight.\n\nThis edition of the NBA Finals should be a real treat. Boston has been the most dominant team in basketball all season, but they do not have the best player on the floor, Luka Doncic. It should make for an entertaining series, hopefully one that is close because right now, there's no better closer in basketball than Doncic. Watching his wizardry in late-game settings is jaw-dropping.\n\nFor that reason, I'm betting on the underdog. The Mavericks are +188 to win the series, but Luka is +210 to win MVP. If the Mavs cut down the nets, we know who the MVP will be. I'm riding with Doncic in this series, but handicapping tonight's game feels a bit trickier.\n\nBoston is a 6.5-point favorite at home in game one with a total of 214.5. The action tips off at 8:30 pm EST on ABC.\n\nRemember when John Calipari said he didn't want to hijack National Championship night by announcing his departure on the day of? Dan Hurley must not feel the same way about the NBA Finals.\n\nMultiple reports tied JJ Redick to the Los Angeles Lakers coaching vacancy, but that may have been a red herring. With our eyes off the ball, the Lakers have moved in on UConn's back-to-back National Champion head coach. Woj reports the Lakers and Hurley have made preliminary contact and are on the verge of formal conversations to give Hurley a massive long-term deal. Most importantly, it has LeBron's approval, who would love to see Hurley develop his son, Bronny James.\n\nWhen Kentucky made a play on Hurley this offseason, a move to the NBA in the near future was always an option. It may just be happening sooner than we thought. It'd be a real shame if UConn lost its head coach in June, a real shame.\n\nIt's been a slow drip throughout the week. With each new day, a new Kentucky Wildcat has arrived on campus. On Wednesday Kerr Kriisa and Andrew Carr welcomed Otega Oweh to his new Kentucky home. The Oklahoma shooting guard marveled at his new locker that featured a 00 next to his name. A dream is now a reality and there's more where that came from. KSR is expecting four new Wildcats to move in today. Mark Pope's first team is starting to look like a team.\n\nBefore the Kentucky baseball team hosts Oregon State, Kenny Brooks is adding a player from Oregon State. Dominika Paurov\u00e1 announced on Wednesday she is transferring to Kentucky with three years of eligibility remaining. Before arriving in the states, she starred for the Czech Republic National Team. The best performance from her freshman season was actually during the NCAA Tournament when Paurov\u00e1 knocked down 3 of 4 three-pointers to score 17 points.\n\nThe extra day is really testing my patience. Why can't we just let the Bat Cats play on Friday? In the meantime, these stories will make sure you're ready once Kentucky throws the first pitch against Oregon State.\n\nWait till I show you this. Say I Yi Yi and prepare to shake it like a salt shaker when the Ying-Yang Twins come to the Kentucky State Fair. It's not your typical State Fair performance, which should create a delightful people-watching experience at the Expo Center this August.\n\nIs it really the Kentucky State Fair if the Oak Ridge Boys don't perform? I don't think so. This year they'll be performing their 50th show at the event.\n\nOn this date in 1944, the world witnessed the largest seaborne invasion in history. Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy to begin the liberation of France, and the entire European continent, from Adolf Hitler's despotic rule.\n\nNo matter how masterfully it is portrayed in cinema, no matter how many film reels and images you see from the scene, nothing can truly encapsulate the sacrifices thousands made for the greater good of the world. It's unimaginable. I'm grateful for all of the brave souls who made the perilous journey across the English Channel to ensure their descendants, you and I, can enjoy a life with liberties, free of tyranny.", "source":

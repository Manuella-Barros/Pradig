Kyiv\u00b4s main military intelligence service shared satellite photos it said showed the aftermath of the attack. If confirmed, it would mark Ukraine\u2019s first known successful strike on a Su-57 fighter plane, a twin-engine stealth fighter lauded as Moscow\u2019s most advanced military aircraft. In one photo, black soot marks and small craters can be seen dotting a concrete strip around the parked aircraft. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine\u00b4s Ministry of Defense, the strike took place on Saturday at the Akhtubinsk base in southern Russia, some 589 kilometers (366 miles) from the front line. For the first time, a russian Su-57 jet was hit. On June 8, 2024, a Su-57 multi-purpose fighter was hit on the territory of the Akhtubinsk air base in the Astrakhan region (russia), located 589 kilometers from the frontline.Satellite images of the plane provide evidence of the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/XjgWxTEsa8 \u2014 Defense of Ukraine (@DefenceU) June 9, 2024 It wasn\u00b4t immediately clear what weapons were used, but the airfield\u00b4s distance from Ukraine suggests that it was likely hit by drones. The strike comes after the United States and Germany recently authorized Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv. Ukraine has already used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from President Joe Biden that allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine\u00b4s second-largest city. The Ukrainian agency said that the plane, which is capable of carrying stealth missiles across hundreds of kilometers (miles), was among \u201ca countable few\u201d of its type in Moscow\u2019s arsenal. According to reports by Russian agencies, Moscow\u2019s armed forces obtained \u201cmore than 10\u201d new Su-57s last year, while 76 are set to be produced by 2028. Moscow did not immediately comment on the reports. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry on Saturday claimed its forces downed three Ukrainian drones in the Astrakhan region, home to the Akhtubinsk airstrip. Since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion more than two years ago, Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production and used the drones to strike deep inside Russia, including a gas terminal near St. Petersburg that lies over 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces kept up drone attacks on Russia\u2019s southern border regions, according to local Russian officials. Three drones hit Belgorod province late on Saturday, damaging a power line and blowing out windows but causing no casualties, said Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. The Russian Defense Ministry said another drone was shot down over the nearby Bryansk region. Across Ukraine\u00b4s front-line provinces, Russian shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded at least nine others on Saturday and overnight, according to reports by regional officials. A man died and two women suffered wounds in the village of Khotimla in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region, where shelling damaged the local school, a council building and a shop, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Heavy battles continue in the area as Ukrainian troops try to beat back Russia\u2019s invading forces after a weekslong push by Moscow that sparked fears for Kharkiv and a wave of civilian evacuations.", "summary": "<p>The advanced stealth fighter is said to have been hit on the ground at an airbase over 360 miles behind the front lines.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/09/ukraine-says-it-has-destroyed-an-advanced-russian-stealth-fighter/\">Ukraine Says it Has Destroyed an Advanced Russian Stealth Fighter</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/09/ukraine-says-it-has-destroyed-an-advanced-russian-stealth-fighter/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/GettyImages-1234191344-e1717934676305-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:58:33", "author": "Breitbart London", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.209}

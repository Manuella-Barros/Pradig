Here's everything to know about Nicoletta Ruhl and her relationship with the actor.\n\nTen years after earning her bachelor's degree from Yale University in 2006, Ruhl attended Stanford University. She graduated in 2018 with her master's degree in management, per her LinkedIn.\n\nBefore she earned her graduate degree, Ruhl spent years with the Los Angeles Chargers as the director of digital media. There, she was in charge of building their digital and social presence and she executive produced two broadcast TV shows, per her LinkedIn.\n\nIn August 2020, she moved to StatusPro, a sports technology company specializing in virtual reality. As the head of business development, Ruhl worked on creating a partnership with the NFL to create the first-ever NFL VR simulation game.\n\nWhite and Ruhl first crossed paths during the pandemic, as they both ran on the University of California, Los Angeles' track. However, the couple kept their relationship private at the time.\n\nIt wasn't until New Year's Day in 2022 that Ruhl made their relationship public with a sweet post on her Instagram of the couple ringing in the year together.\n\n\"New year, same peeps \ud83c\udf88,\" she wrote alongside photos of her sitting on White's lap.\n\nAfter Ruhl's Instagram debut, she began making appearances alongside White on red carpet events like the Hustle premiere in Los Angeles in June 2022, where she stepped out alongside White's daughter.\n\nRuhl and White also attended the Truth Be Told season 3 premiere in January 2023, as well as the 13th annual NFL Honors in February 2024.\n\nAfter a few years of dating, White and Ruhl tied the knot in front of 175 of their closest family and friends at the Riviera Country Club in L.A. on May 4, 2024.\n\n\"It was important for all of the people that carry an impact on our daily lives to be present and for each and every one of them to enjoy themselves and feel as though they were part of something intimate and meaningful,\" Ruhl told PEOPLE.\n\nThe festivities included \"5 star food\" and three different DJs for various parts of the evening. Most importantly, though, the newlyweds said they wanted to make sure they had \"enough time to spend with the people who have had a positive impact on our lives and continue to support us daily.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, White said he walked away feeling \"like a prince.\"\n\nRuhl has a close bond with White's teenage daughter, Samaya, who helped them ring in their special day. White shares Samaya with his ex-girlfriend, Bridget Hardy, but the pair split when their daughter was 11 months old.\n\nNow, Samaya is one of White's main motivations in continuing to be ambitious in his career, he told Fox News in 2019.\n\n\"You get different motivating factors in your life, period. I think my biggest motivating factor right now is my daughter,\" he said. \"You got to provide an example for your kids.

All About Nicoletta Ruhl", "body": "The Family Matters actor married his wife, Nicoletta Ruhl, on May 4, 2024. The couple first met during the pandemic and made their relationship public on New Year's Day in 2022. White is a father to one daughter, Samaya, from a previous relationship.\n\nTo White, getting married meant committing himself to Ruhl in every aspect of their lives, he told PEOPLE in May 2024.\n\n\"We've each committed ourselves to loving and helping one another achieve the best possible outcome in anything we set out to do both personally and professionally,\" White said.\n\nRuhl added, \"We don't rush anything and we always have honest intentions for one another. We both fully believe that when you force something, it won't result in the best outcome and because of this we've seen a lot of blessings in our life together thus far.\"\n\nSo who is Jaleel White's wife? Here's everything to know about Nicoletta Ruhl and her relationship with the actor.\n\nTen years after earning her bachelor's degree from Yale University in 2006, Ruhl attended Stanford University. She graduated in 2018 with her master's degree in management, per her LinkedIn.\n\nBefore she earned her graduate degree, Ruhl spent years with the Los Angeles Chargers as the director of digital media. There, she was in charge of building their digital and social presence and she executive produced two broadcast TV shows, per her LinkedIn.\n\nIn August 2020, she moved to StatusPro, a sports technology company specializing in virtual reality. As the head of business development, Ruhl worked on creating a partnership with the NFL to create the first-ever NFL VR simulation game.\n\nWhite and Ruhl first crossed paths during the pandemic, as they both ran on the University of California, Los Angeles' track. However, the couple kept their relationship private at the time.\n\nIt wasn't until New Year's Day in 2022 that Ruhl made their relationship public with a sweet post on her Instagram of the couple ringing in the year together.\n\n\"New year, same peeps \ud83c\udf88,\" she wrote alongside photos of her sitting on White's lap.\n\nAfter Ruhl's Instagram debut, she began making appearances alongside White on red carpet events like the Hustle premiere in Los Angeles in June 2022, where she stepped out alongside White's daughter.\n\nRuhl and White also attended the Truth Be Told season 3 premiere in January 2023, as well as the 13th annual NFL Honors in February 2024.\n\nAfter a few years of dating, White and Ruhl tied the knot in front of 175 of their closest family and friends at the Riviera Country Club in L.A. on May 4, 2024.\n\n\"It was important for all of the people that carry an impact on our daily lives to be present and for each and every one of them to enjoy themselves and feel as though they were part of something intimate and meaningful,\" Ruhl told PEOPLE.\n\nThe festivities included \"5 star food\" and three different DJs for various parts of the evening. Most importantly, though, the newlyweds said they wanted to make sure they had \"enough time to spend with the people who have had a positive impact on our lives and continue to support us daily.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, White said he walked away feeling \"like a prince.\"\n\nRuhl has a close bond with White's teenage daughter, Samaya, who helped them ring in their special day. White shares Samaya with his ex-girlfriend, Bridget Hardy, but the pair split when their daughter was 11 months old.\n\nNow, Samaya is one of White's main motivations in continuing to be ambitious in his career, he told Fox News in 2019.\n\n\"You get different motivating factors in your life, period. I think my biggest motivating factor right now is my daughter,\" he said. \"You got to provide an example for your kids. They watch you more than they listen to you.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel_White", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaleel White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postgraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Be_Told_(2019_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Be Told (2019 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riviera Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/fi53RNM0yE3yZntjiAyPDu0WT2s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x187:751x189)/Jaleel-White-wife-050824-tout-d636ed56bff142a78dfba847226f47b4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551162", "eventUri": "eng-9551162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 1385, "textEnd": 1396}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

People reports that Jaleel White, who is most known as the annoying and nerdy neighbor in Family Matters, walked down the aisle over the weekend. He wed tech executive Nicoletta Ruhl at a country club in LA on May 4. Neutral colors and \"5-star food\" were included alongside three DJs throughout the event.\n\nThe duo met during the pandemic while working out at UCLA's track and made their Instagram debut while ringing in 2022. That June, they attended the movie premiere for Hustle and were even joined by White's daughter, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend Bridget Hardy. White told the outlet that marriage means, \"We've each committed ourselves to loving and helping one another achieve the best possible outcome in anything we set out to do both personally and professionally.\"\n\n\"We don't rush anything, and we always have honest intentions for one another,\" Ruhl shared. \"We both fully believe that when you force something, it won't result in the best outcome, and because of this, we've seen a lot of blessings in our life together thus far.\"\n\nFamous faces who were on the guest list includes Omar Miller, Lamorne Morris, Adam Ray, Hannah Stocking, Mekhi Phifer, Alyson Felix, Camilla Belle, and Sina Sadighi. It's unknown if any of White's Family Matters co-stars were in attendance, but just going off that small group of guests, it sounds like it was the wedding to be at regardless. White and Ruhl seem to be as happy as ever, and they are only just getting started with this new chapter in their lives.\n\nAside from wedding plans, Jaleel White has been pretty busy as of late. The actor reprised his role as Steve Urkel in the animated direct-to-video movie Urkel Saves Santa: The Movie. He also recently landed the hosting gig for new syndicated game show, The Flip Side. Later this year, he will star in the Disney+ series Star Wars: Skeleton Crew alongside Jude Law, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, Robert Timothy Smith, Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, Tunde Adebimpe, and Kerry Condon.\n\nCongratulations to the newlywed couple. This is surely an exciting time, and there is no telling what adventures are in store. Jaleel White and Nicoletta Ruhl look to be as in love as ever and ready to start this new chapter.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Urkel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Urkel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaleel White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Benson_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omar Benson Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamorne_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamorne Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhi_Phifer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mekhi Phifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kiera_Armstrong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Kiera Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Skeleton_Crew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: Skeleton Crew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Condon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerry Condon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunde_Adebimpe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tunde Adebimpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_Belle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camilla Belle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Law", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct-to-video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allyson Felix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/01/31/4dd1508e-52f5-4734-9db1-a755c2d97113/jaleel-white-fanatics-getty.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551162", "eventUri": "eng-9551162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 91, "textEnd": 96, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

They hard launched their relationship on Instagram during New Year's in 2022. Ruhl posted images of the two cuddling, celebrating New Year's Day. They went on to make their red carpet debut as a couple in 2022 during the premiere of White's Netflix film Hustle.

The nuptials come just months before the actor -- famous for portraying the nerdy but lovable Steve Urkel -- will drop a new book, Growing Up Urkel.\n\nWhite, a UCLA alum, met Ruhl while working out at UCLA's Drake Stadium over the pandemic. The outlet reports she was a swimmer at Yale before earning a business degree from Stanford. This is White's first marriage.\n\nSome of the wedding guests included 8 Mile star Mekhi Phifer, Ballers star Omar Miller and U.S. track star Allyson Felix.\n\n\"It was important for all the people that carry an impact on our daily lives to be present and for each and every one of them to enjoy themselves as thought they were part of something intimate and meaningful,\" Ruhl tells the magazine.\n\nPeople reports the couple performed a choreographed dance to Marvin Gaye's \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\"\n\nThat White can bust out a dance move comes as no surprise. He showed he could do just that as a young Steve Urkel (remember Do the Urkel?!) and then again on Dancing With the Stars, where appeared on season 14 with Kym Johnson. They danced the foxtrot to \"The Way You Look Tonight\" and the tango to \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\" They finished in eighth place.\n\nWhite was a child star on the hit ABC sitcom from 1989 until 1997. His initial appearance was supposed to only be a cameo but he quickly became one of the show's biggest stars. The Urkel character continues to be one of the most iconic characters in the history of television.\n\nIn 2017, White spoke to ET about a Family Matters reboot before dishing a brilliant idea about his character.\n\n\"He's a cartoon as far as I'm concerned,\" he argued. \"If you advance the clock by 25 years, I'm not sure you could really even capture what he is in live-action ... So that's my 'hint hint,' and what I think should be done.\"\n\nIt's unclear at this time if any of his Family Matters co-stars attended the wedding. In 2022, White's TV dad, Reginald VelJohnson, opened up to ET about what it was like working with White.\n\n\"He was a wonderful kid, [but] I think working with him was a challenge,\" VelJohnson recalled. \"Working with everybody was a challenge, and there were some moments where he was a little difficult. But overall, I have nothing but good memories from him.\"\n\n\"I think, you know, a lot of the kids grew up on the set and we had to deal with children... and that was an interesting experience, dealing with children as they grew up,\" he continued. \"I went to my dressing room and locked the door when I [rehearsed] my scenes because that was the only way. Because kids have a lot of energy... [and] you couldn't deal with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

at LA country club", "body": "ACTOR Jaleel White married tech executive Nicoletta Ruhl in a lavish ceremony in Los Angeles at the weekend.\n\nThe Family Matters star tied the knot with Nicoletta at the Riviera Country Club and threw an extravagant party for 175 guests with three DJs, 'five-star' food, and a neon dancefloor.\n\nThe couple said they wanted their guests to feel part of something \"intimate\" despite the large event.\n\n\"It was important for all of the people that carry an impact on our daily lives to be present and for each and every one of them to enjoy themselves and feel as though they were part of something intimate and meaningful,\" Nicoletta told PEOPLE.\n\nThe wedding decor was neutral, decorated with white candles and hundreds of yellow roses.\n\nNicoletta - who The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed as Jaleel's fiancee - looked stunning in a white strapless gown with a thigh slit and diamond necklace.\n\nJaleel - who played Steve Urkel in '90s sitcom Family Matters - looked dapper in a white blazer and white shirt teamed with black pants.\n\nGuests enjoyed \"five-star food\" and partied on a huge lit-up dancefloor.\n\n\"We had three DJs throughout different parts of the wedding and each were phenomenal,\" Jaleel, 47, revealed.\n\nThey had a star-studded guest list, including Camille Belle, Omar Miller, Lamorne Morris, Adam Ray, Hannah Stocking, Mekhi Phifer, Alyson Felix, and Sina Sadighi.\n\nJaleel's 14-year-old daughter Samaya - who he shares with ex-girlfriend Bridget Hardy - also took pride of place at the nuptials.\n\nIt is the Growing Up Urkel author's first wedding.\n\nDinner consisted of filet mignon and branzino with vegetables, while desert was a red velvet wedding cake with lemon, funfetti and vanilla.\n\nJaleel and Nicoletta surprised guests later with an outfit change and a choreographed dance to Marvin Gaye's 1967 hit, Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\n\nThere was also a photobooth, where guests posed with neon glow sticks that lit up on the dark dancefloor.\n\nOne DJ booth featured \"NICOLETTA & JALEEL\" across the front in bold letters against a technicolor backdrop.\n\nThe couple told the outlet they wanted \"enough time to spend with the people who have had a positive impact on our lives and continue to support us daily.\"\n\nThe U.S. Sun obtained photos of the couple out together at a rehearsal dinner at Catch Steak in Los Angeles, Friday, May 4.\n\nThe couple left the exclusive eatery hand in hand and boarded a party bus with their friends.\n\nJaleel and Nicoletta - who swam at Yale as an undergrad and received her business degree from Stanford Graduate School of Business - met during the pandemic when they both worked out at UCLA's track.\n\nNicoletta is the head of business development at the technology and gaming company, StatusPRO.\n\nAlthough her identity was not revealed until recently, the pair has made several public appearances together.\n\nThey were seen enjoying a date at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in LA on March 29.\n\nThe couple also attended a Dave Chapelle comedy show in New York City in August 2023.\n\nNicoletta made their relationship public on New Year's Day in 2022, sharing a sweet post of her sitting on Jaleel's lap.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ekin_karasin@the-sun.com", "name":

Dessert topped it off with a red velvet wedding cake with lemon, vanilla, and funfetti frosting. Yum!\n\nThere were a few celebrity guests in attendance, too, including Mekhi Phifer, Alyson Felix, Omar Miller, Camilla Belle, Hannah Stocking, and Lamorne Morris. Plus, White's 14-year-old daughter Samaya, who he has from a previous relationship, was obviously there to help her dad celebrate!\n\nAnd as if that weren't enough, Jaleel and Nicoletta even changed outfits mid-celebration and then performed a choreographed dance to Marvin Gaye's song Ain't No Mountain High Enough. So fun!! You can see a heartwarming snap of the ceremony's immediate aftermath -- including Urkel throwing up a celebratory fist bump to a happy guest -- below:\n\nAmazing!\n\nFWIW, Jaleel and Nicoletta had quite the meet cute. During the height of COVID, they both worked out at the track on UCLA's campus in West El Lay.

We both fully believe that when you force something, it won't result in the best outcome and because of this we've seen a lot of blessings in our life together thus far.\"", "source": {"uri": "accessonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel_White", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaleel White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Access (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Urkel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Urkel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riviera Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamorne_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamorne Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla_Belle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camilla Belle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhi_Phifer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mekhi Phifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allyson Felix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustle_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hustle (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://prod-accessonline-be.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/05/JaleelWhiteMarried050824.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551162", "eventUri": "eng-9551162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 208, "textEnd": 213}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Cause Not-So-Surprising Frenz", "body": "It goes without saying, but veteran actor Jaleel White will forever be a household name to many -- well, maybe he goes by the name \"Steve Urkel\" in your home, but the face is nonetheless one of the most recognizable in Hollywood.\n\nAlthough he's long abandoned the geeky persona that brought him TV stardom, save for last year's holiday release of the animated Urkel Saves Santa: The Movie!, the Family Matters standout has been able to successfully branch out into a variety of roles over the years and sustain a respectable career, even prepping for a role in the upcoming Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. He's even tapped back into his voice acting days -- yep, that was him in the Sonic the Hedgehog animated series! -- with many roles that range from Teen Titans Go! and American Dad! to a fun appearance as the \"Urkel Bot\" in a 2019 episode of Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\n\nIt also appears he's now experiencing similar success in his love life as well following his big wedding day this past Saturday (May 4). However, many people seeing his bride for the first time were a bit surprised to see that he really isn't the same as Steve Urkle; his new wife, tech executive Nicholetta Ruhl, is a stark difference from Laura Winslow.\n\nThe new Mrs. White is that in every sense of the word, from the color of the dress she wore and the flowers she held while walking down the aisle to the very apparent color of her skin. This is in no way to say that makes a difference either way, but it does add an interesting perspective to Jaleel's overall relation to the Black community in recent years. A decades-spanning feud with his former Family Matters cast aside, many seemed to feel like the man who fawned to ad nausea over one of the finest chocolate '90s crushes -- major props still to Kellie Shanygne Williams! -- would end up with, well, something a bit more similar in real life. However, when looking at his past dating history from Step by Step actress Christine Lakin to the mother of his now-teenage daughter, it's clear the man has a preference and is not looking to feel any shame about it. While we salute his right to 'go bright,' we can also understand where some of the more decorative reactions are coming from across social media following the wedding pictures exclusively debuted by PEOPLE Magazine (seen above).\n\nMore details on their union below, via PEOPLE:\n\n\"To White, getting married meant committing himself to Ruhl in every aspect of their lives, he told PEOPLE in May 2024.\n\n'We've each committed ourselves to loving and helping one another achieve the best possible outcome in anything we set out to do both personally and professionally,' White said.\n\nRuhl added, 'We don't rush anything and we always have honest intentions for one another. We both fully believe that when you force something, it won't result in the best outcome and because of this we've seen a lot of blessings in our life together thus far.'\"\n\nThe married couple, who met during the pandemic while running track together in Los Angeles, made their relationship public on New Year's Day 2022 and have been building up to the big day this past weekend.\n\nRace debates and critiques from the culture aside, we just hope the brother is happy and providing a great life for daughter Samaya to grow up in.", "source": {"uri": "blackamericaweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Black America Web"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keenan_higgins@blackamericaweb.com", "name": "Keenan Higgins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Urkel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Urkel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel_White", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaleel White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Skeleton_Crew", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: Skeleton Crew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans_Go!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Titans Go!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dad!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Dad!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo_and_Guess_Who?", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellie_Shanygne_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kellie Shanygne Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lakin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lakin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_by_Step_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Step by Step (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://blackamericaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/1715214434589.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C53px%2C765px%2C437px&resize=560%2C320", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551162", "eventUri": "eng-9551162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 998, "textEnd": 1003}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 232095250, "title": "Ryan Fulton completes Hearts transfer as Steven Naismith secures keeper cover for Zander Clark and Craig Gordon", "text": "Hearts have now completed a deal to make Ryan Fulton their fourth signing of the summer. The keeper, who has just been released by Hamilton, will be officially confirmed as a Jambo later this month. The 28-year-old will come in and provide back-up for Scotland keeper Zander Clark and Craig Gordon, who has just missed out on a place in Steve Clarke\u2019s Euro 2024 squad. Third choice Harry Stone has joined Ayr United on loan for a season as the highly-rated youngster gains more experience before returning to Gorgie next summer. Fulton will be one of four summer signings. Hearts also have deals in place to sign Yan Dhanda, Blair Spittal and James Penrice. The medicals for all these players have all been done and completed and the quartet will all join up with Steve Naismith\u2019s squad when they return for pre-season at the end of the month. All the deals are also expected to be officially announced later this month. Boss Naismith knew he had to add more depth to his squad as they look to retain third spot and balance European group stage football. Hearts will go into the Europa League qualifiers but are guaranteed to, at least, drop into the group stages of the Europa Conference League.

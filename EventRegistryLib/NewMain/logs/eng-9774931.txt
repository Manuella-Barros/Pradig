The government called in the army to quell protests against job quotas after the unrest left at least 150 dead and several thousand people, including policemen, wounded and major government installations damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, the ruling Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League-led 14-party alliance leaders held a meeting with Hasina in the chair and passed a resolution that the Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence siding with the then Pakistani junta, must be banned from politics.\n\nPolitical sources familiar with the meeting said Hasina told the meeting that there were intelligence reports that the Jamaat-Shibir clique carried out the arson attacks and damaged the government installations in the capital mobilising their \"trained people\" from different parts of Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2018, complying with a High Court verdict, the Election Commission scrapped Jamaat's registration disqualifying the party, a key partner in the past BNP-led four-party alliance government from 2001-2006 tenure from contesting polls.\n\nThe Bangladesh High Court, in a landmark verdict on August 1, 2013, had declared Jamaat's registration with the Election Commission illegal. Jamaat then appealed to the appellate division and finally lost its registration in 2018.\n\nBangladesh, in 2009, initiated a process to try the key collaborators of Pakistani troops in 1971 on charges of crimes against humanity and six top leaders of Jamaat and one of BNP were hanged after their trial in two special war crimes tribunals while the apex Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld the judgments.

The government called in the army to quell protests against job quotas after the unrest left at least 150 dead and several thousand people, including policemen, wounded and major government installations damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, the ruling Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League-led 14-party alliance leaders held a meeting with Hasina in the chair and passed a resolution that the Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence siding with the then Pakistani junta, must be banned from politics.\n\nPolitical sources familiar with the meeting said Hasina told the meeting that there were intelligence reports that the Jamaat-Shibir clique carried out the arson attacks and damaged the government installations in the capital mobilising their \"trained people\" from different parts of Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2018, complying with a High Court verdict, the Election Commission scrapped Jamaat's registration disqualifying the party, a key partner in the past BNP-led four-party alliance government from 2001-2006 tenure from contesting polls.\n\nThe Bangladesh High Court, in a landmark verdict on August 1, 2013, had declared Jamaat's registration with the Election Commission illegal. Jamaat then appealed to the appellate division and finally lost its registration in 2018.\n\nBangladesh, in 2009, initiated a process to try the key collaborators of Pakistani troops in 1971 on charges of crimes against humanity and six top leaders of Jamaat and one of BNP were hanged after their trial in two special war crimes tribunals while the apex Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld the judgments.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisul_Huq_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anisul Huq (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidencies and provinces of British India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Islami_Chhatra_Shibir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obaidul_Quader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obaidul Quader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/31/1600x900/Razakar_1721542545494_1722396854990.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774931", "eventUri": "eng-9774931", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-08-01", "textStart": 3238, "textEnd": 3252}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Awami League has conducted many movements in the past sitting with Jamaat, it said, adding that for ensuring a free, fair and impartial election in the country, Jamaat-e-Islami presented the concept of caretaker government and based on that formula, fair elections were held in the country on several occasions.\n\nThe Election Commission has already scrapped the registration of Jamaat following a Supreme Court order.\n\nFollowing a verdict of the Supreme Court, the commission cancelled the registration of Jamat in 2013.\n\nTop leaders of Jamaat have been executed on charges of war crimes during the liberation war in 1971.\n\nJamaat appealed challenging against the High Court verdict scraping the registration.\n\nOn November 19, 2023, the Appellate Division rejected the appeal.",

This came as the Bangladesh government decided to restore mobile internet connectivity after an 11-day blackout due to anti-quota protests.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League-led 14-party coalition (Ganabandhan) has decided to ban the right-wing political party that lost its registration from the Election Commission in October 2018 following a high court ruling. This decision was reached during a meeting held at Ganabhaban on Monday night, presided over by Awami League President and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nDecision-making at Ganabhaban\n\nThe Hasina-chaired meeting saw the attendance of several key figures from the ruling alliance. Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Huq Inu, Workers Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon, Toriqat Federation chairman Syed Najibul Bashar Maizbhandari, and Bangladesh Sammabadi Dal general secretary Dilip Barua were among those who gave their stamp of approval for banning the Jamaat.\n\nFollowing the deliberations, these leaders publicly announced the decision in front of the Ganabhaban gates, Bangladesh media report. The leaders held the Jamaat and its alliance partner the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, convicted in multiple corruption cases and currently out of prison following repeated suspensions of her jail term by the Hasina government on medical grounds.\n\nObaidul Quader was quoted as saying, \"The BNP and Jamaat are plotting to disrupt the country's stability. The 14-party alliance has unanimously agreed to ban Jamaat-Shibir to eradicate these anti-national elements for the benefit of the nation.\"\n\nHow Jamaat has reacted\n\nIn response, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman issued a \"strong condemnation\" to protest the \"illegal decision to ban Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami in the meeting of the 14-party alliance\".\n\nRahman, officially the amir of the party, called the decision to ban the party \"illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional\".\n\nHe said, \"Awami League-led 14-party alliance is a political platform. A political party or alliance cannot make any decisions about another political party. The law and constitution of Bangladesh has not given this jurisdiction to anyone. If a party or coalition bans another party, one party will continue to ban the other party. Then there will be no such thing as state discipline.\"\n\nWhat the ban means\n\nHasina's ally Maizbhandari said the ban would prevent Jamaat-Shibir, the students' wing of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, from holding press conferences or engaging in any political activities within Bangladesh.\n\nAwami League leader Biplab Barua hailed this step as a historic victory, asserting that it would help eliminate acts of arson and terrorism in the country. During the meeting, some of the ruling alliance leaders said the home ministry and the law ministry would take the necessary steps to enforce the ban on Jamaat.\n\nWhy ban a political party\n\nPrime Minister Hasina has repeatedly blamed the Jamaat for violent activities and collusion with other militant groups during the recent anti-quota agitation that left several dead and the government paralysed for days. More than 200 protesters died during the protests.\n\nThe Hasina government and the ruling alliance leaders have accused the Jamaat of hijacking the anti-quota agitation across Bangladesh. The government suspects that the Jamaat works for furthering the agenda of Pakistan Army's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).\n\nThe ruling alliance leaders argued that the government should have banned Jamaat much earlier. Despite losing its registration, Jamaat continued to operate politically as an ally of the BNP-led 20-party alliance and other opposition factions over the past few years.\n\nPreviously, the Awami League and its allies had called for Jamaat's ban several times, but the government had not taken such a step. However, following recent acts of vandalism across the country, the Sheikh Hasina-led government has now decided to act, according to sources within the ruling party alliance.\n\nJamaat has a chequered history\n\nThe Jamaat was originally founded in undivided India in 1941 by controversial Islamist thinker Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi. It has a controversial history in Bangladesh, particularly in relation to the 1971 Liberation War.\n\nIts role was questioned by international crimes tribunals, which, in their judgments, documented Jamaat's involvement in forming auxiliary forces for the Pakistan Army. The Jamaat was found to have propped militant groups such as Al-Badr, Razakar, Al Shams, and the Peace Committee that were implicated in various atrocities against Bengalis during the Liberation War of Bangladesh.\n\nFollowing Bangladesh's Independence, the government banned Jamaat and other communal outfits for their opposition to the nation's Liberation War and their collaboration with Pakistani forces. However, these parties were permitted to resume political activities during the rule of late president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP and the father of Khaleda Zia, after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975.\n\nFollowing a long run of militant hardliner approach to politics, the Jamaat was deregistered in August 2013 as a political party, following a high court verdict. Its registration with the Election Commission was cancelled for being illegal. The Jamaat appealed this decision, but ultimately lost its registration in 2018.\n\nPM Hasina-led alliance's decision to ban Jamaat-e-Islami, however, marks a curious development in Bangladesh as it is a rare move when a political formation has taken a call on proscribing its political rival. It remains to be seen how this impacts the political dynamics and stability in Bangladesh.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They are involved in terrorism, unrest, and murder to destabilise the country.\"\n\nThe road transport and bridges minister added: \"Recently, they created instability by staging covert attacks and shootings to put the blame on the government. They have committed unprecedented acts of terrorism, including killing police officers and hanging bodies. It is essential to eradicate this anti-national force for the country's interest.\"\n\nThe law minister spoke with journalists on Tuesday afternoon about how the ban on the Jamaat will be implemented.\n\n\"The prime minister has given me the instructions. Action will be taken by tomorrow [Wednesday]. I will sit with the home minister [Asaduzzaman Khan] shortly. We will inform you under what law the action will be taken once it has been decided,\" he said.\n\nAsked what procedure would be used to make the party illegitimate, the law minister said: \"The protesters said they were not involved in the violence that occurred from Jul 16-20 during the anti-quota movement. We have information that the militants in the Jamaat, Shibir, the BNP, and Chhatra Dal perpetrated these acts.\"\n\n\"If this party is banned, it will improve law and order in the country.\"\n\nIn response to another question, Anisul said: \"When a party is banned, it is done by an executive order. Trying them for war crimes is one thing and banning a party is another.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, a three-hour marathon meeting was held at the Secretariat with the presence of seven key ministers and state ministers.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan told reporters. \"The process of banning Jamaat-e-Islami is under way. There is nothing more to say about this.\"\n\n\"Jamaat is involved in terrorist activities and the rise of militancy. A political decision has been made by the 14-Party Alliance and others. The necessary procedures to implement this decision are in progress,\" he added.\n\nThe 1972 constitution of Bangladesh prohibited the misuse of religion for political purposes, which led to the banning of the Jamaat.\n\nThe ban was imposed under Article 38 of the constitution at that time.\n\nAfter the assassination of Bangabandhu, during the military rule of Ziaur Rahman in 1976, this provision of the constitution was repealed, lifting the ban on religion-based politics.\n\nThis allowed the Jamaat to re-engage in political activities legally.\n\nWhen the Awami League returned to power, Article 38 was reinstated through the Fifteenth Amendment to the constitution in 2011.\n\nThe article now states:\n\n\"Every citizen shall have the right to form associations or unions, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interests of public order and morality. However, no person shall have the right to form or be a member of any association or union if:\n\n(a) It is formed for the purpose of undermining the religious, social, and communal harmony among citizens;\n\n(b) It is formed for the purposes of creating discrimination among citizens based on religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or language;\n\n(c) It is formed for the purposes of organising terrorist or militant activities against the state or citizens, or any other countries;\n\n(d) Its formation and objectives are inconsistent with the constitution.\"\n\nHasanul Haq Inu, president of the Awami League's ally Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal or JaSoD, said the Jamaat was indeed banned under the 1972 constitution.\n\nDuring Zia's era, political activities of JaSoD and the Communist Party of Bangladesh, or CPB, were also banned, he added.\n\nIn addition, several extremist groups have been banned through executive orders over time.\n\nUnder the current Awami League government, 10 extremist and militant organisations have been banned.\n\nThese include Hizb ut-Tahrir, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, or JMB, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh, or JMJB, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh, or HuJI B, Shahadat-e-Al-Hikma, Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ansarullah Bangla Team, Ansar Al Islam, Allah's Party, and Jama'atul Ansar Fil Hind al-Sharqiya.\n\nThe Jamaat has condemned the 14-Party Alliance's decision to ban the party, issuing a statement to the media in protest.\n\nIn the statement, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman said no political party or alliance has the authority to make decisions regarding another political party.\n\nHe said neither Bangladesh's laws nor its constitution grant such powers.\n\n\"If a practice of one party or alliance banning another party starts, it will lead to a situation where parties will keep banning each other, resulting in a collapse of state order,\" he added.\n\nThe statement also accused the government of diverting attention from the student-led anti-discrimination movement, alleging 'indiscriminate mass killings' to suppress the protests.\n\n\"In this chaotic scenario, the government's decision in the 14-Party Alliance meeting to ban the Jamaat is arbitrary, illogical, illegal, and unconstitutional.\"\n\nWith its top leaders executed for war crimes, many imprisoned or in hiding, Jamaat's activities have been significantly curtailed over the past decade.\n\nThe party's central office in Dhaka's Moghbazar has been locked for years, and internal divisions have surfaced.\n\nThe Jamaat is no longer part of the BNP-led alliance after prolonged disputes. The religion-based party has also lost relevance in electoral politics following the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the cancellation of its registration last year.\n\nIf the party is banned, what will be the consequences?\n\nExperts say the Jamaat continued to hold flash rallies and gatherings and remained politically active despite losing its registration. They also maintain a presence on social media.\n\nA formal ban would make these activities illegal, preventing any form of support or funding for the party.\n\nSome experts believe that if banned, Jamaat activists might resort to clandestine operations similar to extremist groups.\n\nShahriar Kabir, president of the advisory council of Ekattorer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, said the government should consider the 'impact' of banning the Jamaat and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir after so many years.\n\nSpeaking to bdnews24.com, Kabir said: \"Jamaat's roots have spread far and wide due to the delay. The destructive, religion-based politics of Jamaat has infiltrated other parties, including the BNP and even the ruling party, as well as the administration. Banning the Jamaat would have international repercussions.\"\n\nKabir also said the Jamaat is not only a national issue but is also linked to the 'international terrorist network'.\n\nHe said: \"Jamaat's ideology does not allow for dissent. If anyone disagrees, they must be eliminated. This ideology should not be permitted in any country's politics.\"\n\nRuhin Hossain Prince, the general secretary of the CPB, said the Jamaat operates openly if politics is unrestricted, but would continue its activities secretly if banned.\n\nHe emphasised the need to raise awareness to prevent the Jamaat from working underground.\n\n\"Banning their politics means not just an official prohibition but also promoting the true politics of the pro-Liberation War forces. It involves exposing their misdeeds and how they integrated religion into politics. Without public awareness against their ideology, the Jamaat will continue its activities even if banned,\" he added.\n\nMuntassir Mamoon, a professor of history at Dhaka University, said: \"The demand to ban Jamaat came from civil society a long time ago. Now the government has announced it. However, announcing and implementing it are two different things. Implementation will face both internal and international challenges.\"\n\nHe said the Awami League should reorganise the civil society, the youth, like-minded parties, and grassroots supporters to counter the inevitable impact.\n\n\"Jamaat is already underground. They might merge with various groups. Over the last 20 years, they have become economically strong,\" he said.\n\nSupreme Court lawyer Tapas Kanti Baul advised caution regarding potential legal complications following the government's executive order to ban the Jamaat.\n\n\"Someone could file a writ petition in the High Court. Jamaat supporters might infiltrate other parties. Banning them won't stop their ideology,\" he said.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami was founded on Aug 26, 1941, by the controversial religious politician Syed Abul A'laa Maududi in British India, initially named Jamaat-e-Islami Hind.\n\nThe party was banned in the region during that time.\n\nIn Pakistan, Jamaat-e-Islami was first banned in 1959 due to allegations of inciting communal riots.\n\nThe ban was reinstated on Jan 4, 1964, due to opposition to the Muslim Family Laws introduced by Ayub Khan, though it was later lifted.\n\nMaududi was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court, but his execution was commuted, and he was eventually released.\n\nDuring the final stages of Bangladesh's liberation struggle, the Jamaat opposed the 11-point demands and other aspects of the independence movement.\n\nDuring the liberation war, the Jamaat and its then student wing, Islami Chhatra Sangha, formed various groups such as Razakar, Al-Badr, and Al-Shams to support the Pakistani forces.\n\nThey committed widespread atrocities including murder, rape, and looting.\n\nThese war crimes were highlighted in various court verdicts.\n\nWith some of their top leaders hanged for war crimes, some in jail and some in hiding, the Jamaat has been in a deep political quagmire for over a decade.\n\nTheir longtime alliance with the BNP also appears to have collapsed after years of controversy.\n\nFinally, the top appeals court confirmed the decision to revoke its registration as a political party, dismissing a challenge against a High Court verdict.\n\nAfter Zia's rule, the party was actively engaged in politics even during the reign of army dictator HM Ershad.\n\nWhen Bangladesh re-established a democratic government, the Jamaat never faced any trouble during the rule of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia. Instead, two of its leaders became members of her cabinet.\n\nThe party, a known anti-liberation force, started to feel intimidated when the Awami League came into power and introduced the war crimes trials in 2010. Most of its top leaders were either hanged or jailed until death.\n\nAfter the 10th general election, the BNP and the Jamaat launched protests to nullify the election. They resumed deadly protests a year later, but the Jamaat faced difficulties as its leaders and activists were arrested. The leaders are often arrested, even now, in meetings for \"plotting violent anti-government activities\".\n\nIt filed an appeal against that verdict revoking its registration, which has recently been settled after a decade. The top court, too, turned down the Jamaat's appeal.\n\nAs they had no registration as a political party, Jamaat candidates had to file their nominations as independent contestants in the 2018 general election. When their ally the BNP allowed them to use its symbol, the Jamaat candidates contested the election with the paddy sheaf logo.\n\nEven before its registration was cancelled, the High Court had declared the Jamaat's election symbol, the 'weighing balance', illegal, as it was an emblem of justice in the courts.\n\nNow besides the ban, the party faces another risk, as the Appellate Division asked a petitioner to go to the High Court for the hearing of an appeal to try Jamaat at the International Crimes Tribunal as an organisation for committing war crimes.\n\n[Writing in English by Arshi

The decision by the government comes after Bangladesh was rocked by protests, which are said to have been hijacked by radical Islamists, resulting in large-scale deaths.\n\nThe decision to ban the Jamaat-e-Islami and its Chhatrashibir was taken by the 14-party ruling alliance led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. Bangladesh Law Minister Anisul Haq told journalists that the ban on the Jamaat would be implemented through an executive order.\n\nJamaat leaders criticised the ban and called it \"illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional\".\n\nThe Election Commission of Bangladesh had already deregistered the Jamaat, a radical right-wing party, after a High Court decision in 2018.\n\nThe law minister said discussions would be held on Wednesday with the home minister to finalise the process for implementing the ban, several Dhaka-based media outlets, including The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe decision to ban the Jamaat comes as Bangladesh takes small steps towards normalcy after violence during students' protests killed around 150 people.\n\nThe government said that public and private offices would function normally from Wednesday.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina also announced that her government would be taking foreign technical assistance for a judicial probe committee, investigating the deaths during the quota agitation, The Daily Star reported on Tuesday.\n\nShe said it was to ensure \"a thorough and standard inquiry\".\n\nAmid this came the announcement of the ban on Jamaat and its students wing.\n\n\"For the sake of the country, the 14-party alliance has decided to ban Jamaat-Shibir to eliminate anti-national evil forces,\" Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader said after a meeting of the alliance parties.\n\nThe meeting took place at Sheikh Hasina's official residence, Gono Bhaban, on Monday evening.\n\nSome Dhaka-based experts had told IndiaToday.In that the quota protest had taken a violent turn as it had been \"hijacked by Islamists\".\n\nThey said radical Islamists of Jamaat and its Chhatrashibir infiltrated the ranks of protesting students and turned it into a battle against the government.\n\n\"It has now become an agitation of Jamaat and other Islamist fundamentalist groups. In a crowd of about 1,000, only three-four students are present,\" senior Dhaka-based journalist Swadesh Roy told IndiaToday.In earlier.\n\n\"Most students have realised that and withdrawn from the agitation,\" he added in the phone call on July 21, when the Bangladesh government disconnected internet services.\n\nPeople critical of Sheikh Hasina's regime have, however, held that the protests, which saw the participation of most political forces, were an organic protest against the government.\n\nExperts say that since its 2018 ban, the Jamaat has been looking at agitations like the quota protests as oxygen to survive.\n\nDespite losing its poll registration, Jamaat continued with its political activities as one of the allies of the main opposition party, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\n\nJamaat on Tuesday called the move to ban it \"illegal\" and said it was part of a well-laid-out plan to crack down against opposition parties.\n\n\"The government has been lying since the beginning to avoid the responsibility of its misdeeds. Using state machineries, they are playing a blame game against Jamaat and other opposition parties,\" Jamaat-e-Islami tweeted from its official X handle.\n\nThe Jamaat-e-Islami's role in the 1971 Liberation War has been tainted with several judgments by war crimes tribunals holding its leaders of playing a key role in the atrocities against Bengalis by siding with the Pakistani army and its

Despite being banned from the electoral process, it continued its political activities by supporting the Bangladesh National Party-led opposition alliance.\n\nThe decision was made during a meeting of the alliance chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her residence.\n\n\"The alliance has agreed to ban Jamaat-Shibir politics on the charges of killing common people and destroying state assets by creating various issues and carrying out militant attacks,\" AL General Secretary Obaidul Qader told reporters in Dhaka.\n\nRashed Khan Menon, a key leader of the alliance and Workers Party supremo, stated, \"We unanimously decided to ban Jamaat-Shibir. Now it is the responsibility of the government to implement it.\"\n\nOther main leaders, including Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal President Hasanul Huq Inu, Workers Party of Bangladesh President Rashed Khan Menon, Toriqat Federation Chairman Syed Najibul Bashar Maizbhandari, and General Secretary of Bangladesh Sammabadi Dal Dilip Barua, also lodged their presence in the meeting.\n\nJamaat's chequered history is also highlighted by International Crimes Tribunal rulings, which indicted Jamaat for its role in the 1971 atrocities.\n\nSome judgments indicated that Jamaat was instrumental in forming the Pakistani occupation army's auxiliary forces, such as Al-Badr, Razakar, Al Shams, and the Peace Committee, which were actively involved in committing atrocities against fellow Bengalis.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bhuvan_krishna@swarajyamag.com", "name": "Bhuvan

The demand grew louder when the Awami League government took the initiative to prosecute war criminals in 2009. However, no effective action has been taken by the government in the 15 years since.\n\nThe ruling party have blamed BNP and Jamaat agitators for the recent violence surrounding the quota reform movement. On Monday, a decision was taken at a meeting of the 14 Party Alliance to ban Jamaat and Shibir.\n\n\"During the meeting of the 14 Party Alliance it was unanimously decided to ban Jamaat-Shibir from politics. Many people have been demanding it for a long time.\"\n\n\"The Jahanara Imam-led Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee and the Ganajagaran Mancha movement had demanded their banning too,\" he said.\n\nThe minister said, \"According to the Representation of the People Order, no unregistered party can participate in elections. After the Second World War, Hitler's Nazi Party could not do politics in Germany.

The real objective is to destroy the institutions that serve Bangladesh and improve the lives of its people, aiming to destabilise the entire country.\"\n\nShe highlighted the nation's development achievements, saying: \"Today, Bangladesh has achieved global recognition due to our progress. When people hear the name of Bangladesh, they show respect.

This unusual alliance with extreme left and right-wingers is baffling.\"\n\nThe prime minister questioned the funding of the protests, asking: \"Where do they get so much money from? Who is financing their daily expenses for the movement?\"\n\nShe expressed her dismay. \"I worked tirelessly to elevate Bangladesh to a position of honour, which they have tarnished. By undermining me through their protests, they have dragged the country down.\n\n\"If they had patriotism or a sense of responsibility, they would not have acted in this manner.\"\n\nHighlighting the damage to government establishments, she questioned: \"They have destroyed facilities meant for public service. Whose interests are they serving by doing this?\"\n\nReflecting on the government's efforts, Hasina said: \"I have worked to improve people's lives, ensuring food security and healthcare, providing free medical services. Despite the personal loss of my parents, I have focused on changing the fate of this nation, striving for a better life for our people.\"\n\nStressing the Awami League government's achievements, she said: \"As a victorious nation from the Liberation War, Bangladesh stands proudly on the global stage with dignity.

Islamic party after deadly jobs protests", "body": "DHAKA, July 31 -- Bangladesh is set to ban the main Islamic party and its student wing today, which the government blames for violence this month that killed 150 people during student-led protests against reservations in government jobs.\n\nThe move, decried as \"unconstitutional and illegal\" by the party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, comes after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blamed it and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for violence that forced her to impose curfew.\n\nThe ban is to be adopted through an executive order on Wednesday, Anisul Huq, the minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, told Reuters.\n\n\"For the sake of the country the decision has been made,\" Huq added.\n\nIn a statement, Jamaat condemned the Awami League-led ruling alliance's decision as \"illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional\", but did not say how it would respond.\n\n\"Using state machinery, they are playing a blame game against Jamaat and other opposition parties,\" said Shafiqur Rahman, chief of the party, which, along with the opposition, had denied the government's statement that they stoked violence.\n\nJamaat was effectively banned from contesting elections by a 2013 court decision that its registration as a political party conflicted with the South Asian nation's secular constitution.\n\nBangladesh shut down the internet and sent the army to enforce a nationwide curfew as the demonstrations spread after they began in universities and colleges in June.\n\nThousands were injured as security forces fired rubber bullets, tear gas and lobbed sound grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters who flooded into the streets.\n\nThe violence was the biggest test Hasina, 76, has faced since winning a fourth straight term in elections in January that were boycotted by BNP and also marred by deadly protests.\n\nShe first led her party to victory in elections in 1996, serving one five-year term before regaining power in 2009, never to lose again.\n\nRights groups and critics say Hasina has become increasingly autocratic during her last 15 years in power, marked by arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, charges she denies.\n\nThe United Nations, global rights groups, the United States and Britain criticised Dhaka's use of force against the demonstrators, asking it to uphold the right to peaceful protest.\n\nMembers of the Students Against Discrimination group, who had agreed to call off their agitation after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas on July 21, said they would march on Wednesday to protest recent deaths, arrests, and intimidation.\n\nRights groups have condemned authorities for arrests of close to 10,000 people over the past two weeks on charges of involvement in clashes and destroying state property.\n\n\"We will also demand a United Nations investigation into the violence,\" Mohammad Mahin Sarkar, a co-ordinator of the movement for quota reform, said in a statement.\n\nIn response, Huq said Dhaka had set up a judicial inquiry to investigate thoroughly.\n\nExperts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs more attractive at a time when inflation is running around 10 per cent. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam",

"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is set to ban on Wednesday the main Islamic party and its student wing, which the government blames for violence this month that killed 150 people during student-led protests against reservations in government jobs.\n\nThe move, decried as \"unconstitutional and illegal\" by the party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, comes after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blamed it and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for violence that forced her to impose curfew.\n\nThe ban is to be adopted through an executive order on Wednesday, Anisul Huq, the minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, told Reuters.\n\n\"For the sake of the country the decision has been made,\" Huq added.\n\nIn a statement, Jamaat condemned the Awami League-led ruling alliance's decision as \"illegal, extrajudicial and unconstitutional\", but did not say how it would respond.\n\n\"Using state machinery, they are playing a blame game against Jamaat and other opposition parties,\" said Shafiqur Rahman, chief of the party, which, along with the opposition, had denied the government's statement that they stoked violence.\n\nJamaat was effectively banned from contesting elections by a 2013 court decision that its registration as a political party conflicted with the South Asian nation's secular constitution.\n\nBangladesh shut down the internet and sent the army to enforce a nationwide curfew as the demonstrations spread after they began in universities and colleges in June.\n\nThousands were injured as security forces fired rubber bullets, tear gas and lobbed sound grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters who flooded into the streets.\n\nThe violence was the biggest test Hasina, 76, has faced since winning a fourth straight term in elections in January that were boycotted by BNP and also marred by deadly protests.\n\nShe first led her party to victory in elections in 1996, serving one five-year term before regaining power in 2009, never to lose again.\n\nRights groups and critics say Hasina has become increasingly autocratic during her last 15 years in power, marked by arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, charges she denies.\n\nThe United Nations, global rights groups, the United States and Britain criticised Dhaka's use of force against the demonstrators, asking it to uphold the right to peaceful protest.\n\nMembers of the Students Against Discrimination group, who had agreed to call off their agitation after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas on July 21, said they would march on Wednesday to protest recent deaths, arrests, and intimidation.\n\nRights groups have condemned authorities for arrests of close to 10,000 people over the past two weeks on charges of involvement in clashes and destroying state property.\n\n\"We will also demand a United Nations investigation into the violence,\" Mohammad Mahin Sarkar, a co-ordinator of the movement for quota reform, said in a statement.\n\nIn response, Huq said Dhaka had set up a judicial inquiry to investigate thoroughly.\n\nExperts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs more attractive at a time when inflation is running around 10%.\n\n(Reporting by Ruma Paul in Dhaka and Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai;

party conflicted with the South Asian nation's secular constitution.\n\nBangladesh shut down the internet and sent the army to enforce a nationwide curfew as the demonstrations spread after they began in universities and colleges in June.\n\nThousands were injured as security forces fired rubber bullets, tear gas and lobbed sound grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters who flooded into the streets.\n\nThe violence was the biggest test Hasina, 76, has faced since winning a fourth straight term in elections in January that were boycotted by BNP and also marred by deadly protests.\n\nShe first led her party to victory in elections in 1996, serving one five-year term before regaining power in 2009, never to lose again.\n\nRights groups and critics say Hasina has become increasingly autocratic during her last 15 years in power, marked by arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, charges she denies.\n\nThe United Nations, global rights groups, the United States and Britain criticised Dhaka's use of force against the demonstrators, asking it to uphold the right to peaceful protest.\n\nMembers of the Students Against Discrimination group, who had agreed to call off their agitation after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas on July 21, said they would march on Wednesday to protest recent deaths, arrests, and intimidation.\n\nRights groups have condemned authorities for arrests of close to 10,000 people over the past two weeks on charges of involvement in clashes and destroying state property.\n\n\"We will also demand a United Nations investigation into the violence,\" Mohammad Mahin Sarkar, a co-ordinator of the movement for quota reform, said in a statement.\n\nIn response, Huq said Dhaka had set up a judicial inquiry to investigate thoroughly.\n\nExperts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs more attractive at a time when inflation is running around 10%.\n\n(Reporting by Ruma Paul in Dhaka and Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Writing by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "source":

Later, they observed one-minute silence in the memory of the deceased.\n\nQuader said different political, social and liberation war organizations and civil society have been demanding the ban of Jamaat-Shibir for long. Gana Adalat led by 'Ekattorer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee' under the leadership of Shaheed Janani Jahanara Imam and later Ganajagoron Mancha also demanded the banning of Jamaat-Shibir, he added.\n\nAs per the Representation of the People Order (RPO), he said, a political party could not take part in the election if the party has no registration with Election Commission. There are such examples in the world.\n\nThe minister said the International Crimes Tribunal mentioned the Jamaat had relation with war crimes. In fact, Jamaat is an evil communal force in the guise of religion, he said.\n\nEarlier, he said, they (Jamaat-Shibir) were involved in plotting conspiracy and violent activities and those were proved.\n\nHe said everyone knows who used the students, where meetings were held and who financed the violent activities. It is now clear and there is no scope of making confusion among the countrymen, he added.\n\nCriticising a comment of BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the AL general secretary said he is spreading propaganda over the arrest issue. Police didn't arrest any innocent person rather they are arresting those who were involved in recent mayhem seeing the video footage, said Quader.\n\nHe urged all AL leaders and activists to remain alert against all conspiracies of BNP-Jamaat.\n\nAL presidium members Dr Abdur Razzak, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya Bir Bikkram, Kamrul Islam, Dr Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin and Advocate Jahangir Kabir Nanank, joint general secretaries Mahabub-ul Alam Hanif, AFM Bahauddin Nasim and Dr Dipu Moni, organizing secretary Ahmed Hossain, BM Mozammel Haque, SM Kamal Hossain and Mirza Azam, publicity secretary Dr Abdus Sobhan Golap, science affairs secretary Engineer Abdus Sabur and office secretary Barrister Biplob Barua, among others, were present.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType":

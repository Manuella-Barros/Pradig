Whatever the formation of the new government, it will almost certainly involve the ANC.\n\nWhile the ANC could rule the country without a formal coalition agreement, the party has indicated that this could make governance a tough, uphill battle.\n\nYesterday, 5 June, the ANC held a media briefing to provide an update on various internal and external discussions taking place.\n\nThe ANC revealed that it has thus far held a series of exploratory meetings with the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Democratic Alliance (DA), the National Freedom Party (NFP) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA) and has unsuccessfully attempted to initiate talks with the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party.\n\nNow, the party has less than two weeks before the first sitting of the National Assembly, and its powerful national executive committee (NEC) is meeting today, 6 June, to chart the way forward.\n\nANC's first deputy secretary-general, Nomvula Mokonyane, stated that the below-mentioned engagements with opposition parties were brief and would resume only after the ANC's NEC meeting.\n\nThese directions taken at a national level are likely to trickly down to provincial levels where there is no outright majority.\n\nGovernment of National Unity option\n\nAt this stage, the ANC said that it favours the idea of convening a type of Government of National Unity (GNU).\n\nThis would encompass forming a government with represented political parties encompassing wide-ranging ideologies, similar to that seen in the post-1994 elections.\n\n\"The results indicate that the South Africans want all parties to work together,\" ANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told journalists.\n\n\"The conversation is looking at a government of national unity, because this is what the people of South Africa have said to us: put together a multiparty arrangement that works for the benefit of South Africa,\" added Bhengu-Motsiri.\n\nSome analysts have said that forming a GNU would be a liklelier scenario for the ANC avoid aligning with a coalition partner that might be unpopular with its supporters.\n\nHowever, given the wide-ranging ideologies, there are still risks of potential instability and gridlock within such a government due to the necessity of managing multiple partners with diverse interests.\n\nAlthough talks are still in their infancy, parties like the DA and IFP have already indicated that they will be selective about the parties that they agree to work with, saying that parties that they see \"do not uphold the constitution\" are deal-breakers.\n\nANC/DA/IFP and other smaller parties\n\nThe ANC, DA, and IFP (a collective 263 out of 400 seats) have confirmed that very broad \"initial stage\" talks have taken place between the parties have taken; however, they are still in their infancy stages.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen said that \"parties who respect the rule of law and the Constitution, who seek stability and growth... must have a conversation in a mature way about how do we see the way forward.\"\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Steenhuisen explicitly shut the door on the EFF and MKP being part of such discussions, saying that the policies of the MK and the EFF amount to an \"all-out assault on the Constitution of our country.\"\n\nTwo options for an ANC/DA/IFP and other smaller party working relationship have been touted: a 'confidence and supply agreement' and a coalition agreement.\n\nA confidence and supply agreement is where the parties agree to support the government in motions of confidence and appropriation votes but are otherwise free to vote in favour of their own policies or on conscience on legislative bills.\n\nThis could see the ANC keeping executive power with the inclusion of the IFP, while the DA could control the legislature.\n\nA second option, a coalition agreement between these parties could see all of these parties entering into the executive, which could tout a more 'stable' government given their consolidated agreement.\n\nHowever, some against this option believe that this could result in alienating some ANC supporters and finding enough common ground on policy would be a challenge.\n\nThe DA in particular are seen to be more ideologically distant from the ANC other potential coalition partners, which could be sticking points in negotiations. Points of contention between the parties include the National Health Insurance and BBBEE - policy positions that the ANC has prided itself on.\n\nLecturer in Political Studies at Wits University, Dr Nicole Beardsworth, said that coalition partner preferences would differ among factions within the ANC.\n\n\"(Cyril) Ramaphosa and his closest allies are said to favour an oversized coalition with the DA as the most stabilising coalition,\" said Beardsworth.\n\nANC/EFF/MK/PA and other smaller parties\n\nThe ANC has confirmed that it has had preliminary talks with both the EFF and PA, however have been unsuccessful in contacting the MKP.\n\nThese groupings could also consider a 'confidence and supply agreement' or coalition agreement.\n\nHowever, party leaders, particularly in the EFF and PA, have been more clear about their preference for entering into a coalition rather than the former.\n\nPotential coalition options include an ANC-EFF-PA coalition with a combined 207 out of 400 seats, an ANC-EFF-IFP coalition with 215 out of 400 seats, and an ANC-MK-EFF coalition with 256 out of 400 seats.\n\nThe ANC, EFF and PA have a history of forming (sometimes contentious) coalitions at municipal level, such as in Johannesburg, while the MK may be a tougher challenge, given that Zuma has repeatedly said that he would not work with President Cyril \"Ramaphosa's ANC\".\n\nKey policies proposed by EFF and MK Party (if they heed the call for talks) include wide-scale land expropriation without compensation, the nationalisation of key parts of the economy and halting fiscal consolidation, while the PA have remained adamant in their stance on mass deportation (possible points of contention for other partners).\n\nAdditionally, the EFF have called for the National Assembly speaker position as well as the finance minister portfolio, while the PA wants home affairs.\n\nThis could force the ANC to make significant concessions.\n\nBeardsworth said that these options are backed by different factions of the ANC, which will continue to weight the pros and cons.\n\n\"(Deputy President Paul Mashatile)'s faction would be most inclined to work with the EFF, while (party chairperson Gwede Mantashe) seems happier to partner with either EFF or MK,\" said Beardsworth.", "source": {"uri": "businesstech.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessTech"}, "authors":

Facing economic and political challenges, the ANC must decide whether to form a coalition government, secure minority rule with conditional support, or establish a national unity government.\n\nAfrican National Congress leaders held talks on Thursday to try to agree on potential partners to form a new South African government after the party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in the democratic era. The former liberation movement has run South Africa since it swept to power with Nelson Mandela at the helm in the 1994 election that marked the end of apartheid. But it was punished for its chequered record in last week's election.\n\nWhile still the largest party, the ANC can no longer govern alone and signalled on Wednesday it would seek to form a government of national unity with a wide range of parties. \"This is a time for sober minds,\" said ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula as members of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) gathered in Johannesburg for a day of talks.\n\n\"We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters. Mbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nSouth Africa has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption. The election outcome has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39. MK confirmed in a statement on Thursday that \"engagements with the (ANC) have indeed taken place regarding the coalition discussions\".\n\n\"A meeting is expected to take place soon, where the MK Party will hear the views presented with an open mind,\" it said. The new parliament has to convene within two weeks of Sunday's results declaration and one of its first acts must be to elect the president.\n\nThe constitutional deadline, which will fall on or near June 16, is putting pressure on the ANC and others to reach an agreement quickly. Options could include a coalition government, a minority ANC government with backing on key votes from other parties in exchange for policy concessions, or a government of national unity.\n\nANC'S DIFFICULT SEARCH FOR PARTNERS \"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" Mbalula said.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF. Any deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nA group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards reading \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\". On the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\". The ANC said on Wednesday it would not talk to anyone who demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining an alliance.\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals. He was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption, a fact that barred him for running for parliament. He remains well-liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order.\n\nThe province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.

We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nRead: South Africa elections: Cyril Ramaphosa's pyrrhic victory\n\nA group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards reading \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC said on Wednesday it would not talk to anyone who demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining an alliance.\n\nRead: All eyes on ANC as it discusses who to enlist to govern South Africa\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.", "source": {"uri": "nation.africa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Image: Michele Spatari / AFP\n\nSouth Africa's ruling African National Congress party was holding internal talks on Thursday to decide how to form a government, after it failed to win an outright majority in last week's general election.\n\nBookmark The South African website's Elections 2024 hub for the latest news you need to know\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC won 40 percent of the vote - its lowest score ever - and for the first time since the advent of democracy in 1994 needs the backing of other parties.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Ramaphosa quipped to reporters, as he arrived at a hotel on the outskirts of Johannesburg where the ANC's decision-making body was meeting.\n\n\"Are you that worried?\"\n\nThe party of late anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela is divided over who to share power with, analysts say.\n\nIt will have only 159 members in the 400-seat National Assembly, down from 230 in 2019.\n\nOn Wednesday, ANC spokeswoman Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said the top leadership favoured forming a broad coalition for a government of national unity.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board because South Africans want us to work together for their sake,\" ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBut observers say this might be hard to pull off given radical differences between some groups that should be part of it.\n\n\"I cannot... see how it can really work,\" analyst and author Susan Booysen told AFP.\n\n\"There is just so much bad blood and ill feeling between different political parties.\"\n\nAmong them are the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), which won 87 seats with a liberal, free-market agenda, and the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which secured 39 lawmakers and supports land redistribution and the nationalisation of key economic sectors.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the ANC was in discussions also with the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which will hold 17 seats, and the anti-immigration Patriotic Alliance (PA) that will have nine.\n\nThe ANC also \"repeatedly\" reached out to former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which won 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 seats, but received no response.\n\nZuma, a former ANC chief, has long been bitter about the way he was ousted under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018.\n\nThe MK, which was only established late last year, has rejected the election results and said it would not back an ANC-led government if Ramaphosa remains at the helm.\n\nBut the president's party plans to keep him.\n\nAnalyst Daniel Silke said the ANC was likely floating the idea of a \"broad church\" government to appease some members before veering towards a narrower coalition if national unity talks failed.\n\nMany within the party oppose a deal with the DA, which is favoured by investors and the business community but has policies at odds with the ANC's left-wing traditions.\n\nReports suggesting the ANC was considering forming a minority government with external backing from the DA caused a \"huge outcry\", said Booysen.\n\nOutside the hotel where the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) was meeting, a handful of protesters held signs reading \"Not in our name. #NotwiththeDA\".\n\nThe South African Communist Party, an historic ally of the ANC, also said it was against any arrangement with \"the right-wing, DA-led anti-ANC neo-liberal forces\".\n\nTogether the ANC and the DA hold a comfortable majority in parliament.\n\nAny agreement with the EFF would instead require the support of at least another party.\n\nThe new parliament is to meet in less than two weeks and one of its first tasks will be to elect a president to form a new government.", "source":

Amid concerns about potential coalitions, particularly with the DA, ANC seeks to balance economic demands and historical grievances.\n\nSinah Molokwane, a lifelong member of South Africa's ruling African National Congress, is struggling to accept that her party will be sharing power for the first time since it ended white minority rule 30 years ago.\n\nANC leaders held talks on Thursday on potential partners for a new government after voters angered by economic stagnation, high unemployment, crime and power blackouts ended a majority it has held since 1994, leaving it little choice but to try and forge a coalition with its rivals. It could bring in parties as diverse as the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA).\n\nBut for many ANC rank and file members the prospect of an alliance including the DA is unpalatable, reflecting divisions within the party's factions over who to partner with. \"I am wondering who is going to be with the ANC (in the coalition)...So, I'm just worried about that but hopefully (it's) not the DA,\" said 52-year-old Molokwane, a resident of Johannesburg's Soweto township and a member of the ANC's women's league.\n\nOutside the ANC's leaders' meeting, a small group of people demonstrated with yellow signs reading \"Not in Our Names. NotWithTheDA.\" A deal with the DA is favoured by the business community and global investors, but some ANC supporters see it as a potential throwback to South Africa's painful past.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to see the white minority running the country again after what they did to us during apartheid,\" said Rosebella Joyi, a 90 year-old ANC supporter from East London, a city in the southeast. In a country with a history of codified racism where white South Africans make up just 7% of the population of 62 million, the DA has struggled to shake off an image as a party of white privilege - a notion that its leaders firmly reject.\n\nWestern Cape - the province the DA has controlled since 2009 - has done measurably better than the rest of South Africa. It boasts the country's lowest jobless rate. Its main city Cape Town is a major tourist destination. Even the country's notorious power cuts are less severe. Still, ANC supporters like Virginia Hili, 58, from East London are wary.\n\n\"We know that economic stability is important, and we see that Cape Town is better when it comes to job opportunities,\" she said. \"But we don't know what the ANC will promise the DA in return for its support,\" added Hili, who could not be drawn into specifying the potential concessions she was concerned the DA might get.\n\nBAD BLOOD Mindful of alienating its support base, the ANC said on Wednesday it was leaning towards a government of national unity including several parties, even though internal party documents label such an option as a highly unstable alliance unlikely to last long.\n\nA narrower coalition with the DA that would have given it top parliamentary jobs was rejected outright by the party leadership, party officials said. The ANC will have 159 seats out of 400 in the new National Assembly, while the DA will have 87.\n\nThe populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, will have 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance nine. All of these potential partners present complications for the ANC.\n\nZuma, whose MK party finished a surprising third in the May 29 vote, was forced to quit as president in 2018 following a series of corruption scandals. He was later jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption and was barred from running for parliament. He is now an implacable rival of President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the ANC said he had rebuffed its approaches to talk.\n\nPolitical analysts believe the EFF, led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, may be the most natural fit for the ANC. But they warn that EFF policy proposals, including nationalising mines and banks and seizing white-owned land for redistribution to Black farmers, could tank the economy.\n\nThe EFF leader's history of bitter feuds with the ANC could lead to instability were Malema's party brought in to help govern, ANC supporter Molokwane said. \"I don't know if there would be peace,\" said Molokwane. \"It's tough. I don't know what is going to happen.\" (Additional reporting by Johnnie Isaac in East London; Writing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Joe Bavier and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n\n(This story has

He said the ANC meeting, which would decide whether to back that idea over a narrower coalition with one or two parties, was likely to last all day.\n\nAn agreement of some sort needs to be in place by June 16, the deadline for South Africa's new Parliament to sit and elect a president.\n\nSouth Africans vote for parties and they get seats in Parliament according to their share of the vote. Lawmakers then elect the president and while Ramaphosa is still expected to be the candidate for president in a government involving multiple parties, it needs to be formalized. ANC would need help from others to reelect him given it has lost its parliamentary majority. Ramaphosa, 71, is seeking a second and final term.\n\nSouth Africa is seeking to minimize any uncertainty through what promises to be a complex process that is likely to run well into next week. It is keeping South Africans on tenterhooks at one of the most important times in their young democracy.\n\nThe unity government now appeared a more likely scenario than a direct coalition between the ANC and the main opposition Democratic Alliance, or DA, party, which gained the second largest share of the vote with nearly 22%.\n\nMore than 50 parties contested the election with at least eight of them receiving significant shares of support. They range from the centrist DA, viewed as a business-friendly party, to the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, which wants to nationalize parts of the economy, including South Africa's important gold and platinum mines and the central bank.\n\nThere is also the new MK party of former President Jacob Zuma, which has said it won't negotiate while Ramaphosa is ANC leader, a position largely driven by Zuma's animosity toward the man who replaced him as president.\n\nAny unity government plan from ANC would still have to be taken to those other parties, some of whom are more opposed to each other than ANC. DA has pledged never to work with EFF or MK, for example, and there are clear divisions to overcome.\n\nThere's a split also within ANC, which isn't completely behind the unity government possibility. Mbalula said that he expected debate and disagreement in Thursday's meeting and it would likely last all day. The meeting is of the ANC's National Executive Committee, a body of more than 80 senior party members that includes Ramaphosa as ANC leader. It decides the party's direction.\n\nWhile ANC's top leaders are seen to be open to a direct coalition with DA, grassroots party members have opposed that, sometimes with racial undertones that are often not far from the surface in a country that still wrestles with its history of brutal segregation.\n\nSome ANC supporters and allies, like the national congress of trade unions, have cast the white-led DA as a party that prioritizes the interests of South Africa's white minority over Black people, who make up more than 80% of the population.\n\nDA has denied that characterization and pointed to its large numbers of Black support, reflected in the fact that it received the second-highest number of votes across the country.\n\nPolitical analyst Asanda Ngoasheng said the inclusive national unity government plan was \"the safest option\" for ANC to shore up its own base given it was reeling from its worst election result, and also avoid the economic uncertainty that might come with a narrower coalition with the Marxist EFF party.\n\n\"I think a government of national unity with multiple parties in collaboration ... is the best way and I think it is the smart decision,\" she said on the Newzroom Afrika news channel.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

government", "body": "ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (L) was holding talks on how to form a government after his party lost its parliamentary majority\n\nSouth Africa's ruling ANC party was holding internal talks on Thursday to decide how to form a government, after it failed to win an outright majority in last week's general election.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress won 40 percent of the vote -- its lowest score ever -- and for the first time since the advent of democracy in 1994 needs the backing of other parties.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Ramaphosa quipped to reporters, as he arrived at a hotel on the outskirts of Johannesburg where the ANC's decision-making body was meeting. \"Are you that worried?\"\n\nThe party of late anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela is divided over who to share power with, analysts say.\n\nIt will have only 159 members in the 400-seat National Assembly, down from 230 in 2019.\n\nOn Wednesday, ANC spokeswoman Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said the top leadership favoured forming a broad coalition for a government of national unity.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board because South Africans want us to work together for their sake,\" ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBut observers say this might be hard to pull off given radical differences between some groups that should be part of it.\n\n\"I cannot... see how it can really work,\" analyst and author Susan Booysen told AFP.\n\n\"There is just so much bad blood and ill feeling between different political parties.\"\n\nAmong them are the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), which won 87 seats with a liberal, free-market agenda, and the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which secured 39 lawmakers and supports land redistribution and the nationalisation of key economic sectors.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the ANC was in discussions also with the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which will hold 17 seats, and the anti-immigration Patriotic Alliance (PA) that will have nine.\n\nThe ANC also \"repeatedly\" reached out to former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which won 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 seats, but received no response.\n\nZuma, a former ANC chief, has long been bitter about the way he was ousted under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018.\n\nThe MK, which was only established late last year, has rejected the election results and said it would not back an ANC-led government if Ramaphosa remains at the helm.\n\nBut the president's party plans to keep him.\n\n- 'Outcry' -\n\nAnalyst Daniel Silke said the ANC was likely floating the idea of a \"broad church\" government to appease some members before veering towards a narrower coalition if national unity talks failed.\n\nMany within the party oppose a deal with the DA, which is favoured by investors and the business community but has policies at odds with the ANC's left-wing traditions.\n\nReports suggesting the ANC was considering forming a minority government with external backing from the DA caused a \"huge outcry\", said Booysen.\n\nOutside the hotel where the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) was meeting, a handful of protesters held signs reading \"Not in our name. #NotwiththeDA\".\n\nThe South African Communist Party, an historic ally of the ANC, also said it was against any arrangement with \"the right-wing, DA-led anti-ANC neo-liberal forces\".\n\nTogether the ANC and the DA hold a comfortable majority in parliament.\n\nAny agreement with the EFF would instead require the support of at least another party.\n\nThe new parliament is to meet in less than two weeks and one of its first tasks will be to elect a president to form a new government.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type":

However, some analysts said that the lure of power may end up bringing most of the largest parties together.\n\nThe ANC's majority collapsed in the 29 May vote from 57.5% in 2019 to 40.2%, amid high unemployment and degraded public services, as well as a challenge from former president, Jacob Zuma, whose new uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party came in a surprise third place.\n\n\"The conversation is looking at a government of national unity, because this is what the people of South Africa have said to us: put together a multiparty arrangement that works for the benefit of South Africa,\" ANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing at the party's headquarters. \"The ANC has reached out to everyone.\"\n\nShe said the proposal from the party's 27-member national working committee would be sent to the national executive committee, its 87-member decision making body, on Thursday, alongside other options including a minority government.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the ANC had met with the DA and EFF, as well as the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom party and the Patriotic Alliance, which supports deporting illegal immigrants and reintroducing the death penalty.\n\n\"The DA position is that we wouldn't want to be part of a governance arrangement with the EFF,\" said Solly Malatsi, the party's spokesperson. Its leaders have repeatedly said warned of a \"doomsday coalition\" between the ANC and the EFF or MK, who support nationalising the central bank and seizing the land of white farmers.\n\n\"We don't want a government of national unity, we will end up with the wrong people,\" EFF leader Julius Malema, a former ANC youth leader, told a press conference last week, adding that his party only talks to the white-led DA \"out of principle\".\n\n\"It makes the most sense for the ANC and the DA to do a coalition, but both of them could suffer politically if they do that,\" said Marisa Louren\u00e7o, a political analyst. \"So I think a government of national unity is a way to appease all political players.\"\n\nShe said the DA and EFF are likely to swallow their differences: \"There's a lot of power attached to being in a government of national unity.\"\n\nMK leaders say they won't work with the ANC under current president Cyril Ramaphosa.

It won 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament, down from 230 in the previous election.\n\nIt is the first time the ANC has lost its majority since Nelson Mandela led the party to victory in the first democratic elections after Apartheid ended in 1994. Opponents have accused the government of failing to fulfill its \"better life for all\" promise, citing persistent crime, poverty, and high unemployment rates in Africa's most industrialized economy.\n\nThe center-right DA received 22% of the vote, equating to 87 seats; former President Jacob Zuma's left-wing MK won 15%, with 58 seats; and the radical Economic Freedom Fighters received 9%, taking 39 seats.\n\n\"The results indicate that the South Africans want all parties to work together, because no party received an absolute majority to form a government alone at national level, in Gauteng and in KwaZulu-Natal,\" the ANC spokesperson stated on Wednesday.\n\nThe ANC said it has discussed various alliance options, including forming a government of \"national unity\" with parties interested in contributing ideas on how to collectively move the country forward while preserving \"constitutional democracy.\"\n\nSouth African leader Cyril Ramaphosa is running for a second term, and some sort of agreement must be reached to allow parliament, which convenes in less than two weeks, to elect a president.\n\nAnalysts cited by the Associated Press (AP) have warned against

ruling party risks alienating some of its key and traditional supporters if it enters into an alliance with the three major opposition parties, the analysts reportedly claimed.\n\nMeanwhile, the MK Party, which repeatedly accused the government of intimidation in the run-up to the elections, has declared that it will \"not negotiate with the ANC.\"", "source": {"uri": "nigeriasun.com",

However, the second-largest party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has stated it will not join a government that includes some of its smaller rivals.\n\nFollowing last week's election, the ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led the party to victory in the 1994 elections that ended apartheid. Despite remaining the largest party, the ANC can no longer govern alone due to its diminished support.\n\nPunished by voters for persistent poverty, joblessness, rampant crime, rolling power blackouts, and corruption, the ANC has initiated talks with five parties, including the free-marketeer DA and the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). ANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri announced the potential formation of a government of national unity, reflecting the will of the South African people. The party's National Executive Committee is set to discuss options on Thursday.\n\nThe ANC secured 159 seats in the 400-seat National Assembly, while the DA holds 87. The populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, garnered 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) 17, and the far-right Patriotic Alliance (PA) nine.\n\nDA spokesperson Werner Horn stated that the party would not join a government including MK, the EFF, or the PA. Any change in the DA's position would require approval from its federal governing bodies. The EFF declined to comment on their willingness to join a national unity government.\n\nThe South African rand weakened following the ANC's and DA's statements, reflecting market anxiety over the political uncertainty.\n\nAn internal ANC discussion paper, verified by Reuters, noted that a unity government is the most inclusive option and would prevent the ANC from choosing a potentially unpopular coalition partner. However, the document also warned of the risk of instability and gridlock due to the need to manage partners with diverse interests.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri emphasized the ANC's aim to unite a broad range of societal sectors behind the future government and indicated that talks should conclude within a week. She affirmed that ANC leader and President Cyril Ramaphosa would remain in office, dismissing any demands for his removal as a condition for coalition.\n\nThe business sector prefers an ANC-DA coalition, favoring the DA's pro-business stance and its opposition to some of the ANC's Black empowerment policies. However, such a coalition may be unpopular with the ANC's base. The South African Communist Party and COSATU trade union group, both major ANC allies, have expressed opposition to a coalition with the DA.\n\nThe EFF's radical proposals, including nationalizing mines and banks and seizing land from white landowners, are seen unfavorably by markets but could attract ANC supporters.\n\nPA spokesperson Steve Motale said his party is open to joining any government that addresses its main campaign promises, especially the \"mass deportation of all illegal immigrants.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Melanie Verwoerd noted the ANC's challenge of making a unity government work while preparing for future elections. She also highlighted Ramaphosa's experience with broad-based coalitions, referencing his role in negotiating the 1994-1997 national unity government.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri confirmed that the ANC had approached Zuma's MK party, which had a strong showing in the election, but was rebuffed. Zuma remains a significant figure in KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police were deployed to maintain public order due to concerns over potential unrest. - IOL", "source": {"uri": "thezimbabwemail.com",

NotWithTheDA.\"\n\nA deal with the DA is favoured by the business community and global investors, but some ANC supporters see it as a potential throwback to South Africa's painful past.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to see the white minority running the country again after what they did to us during apartheid,\" said Rosebella Joyi, a 90 year-old ANC supporter from East London, a city in the southeast.\n\nIn a country with a history of codified racism where white South Africans make up just 7% of the population of 62 million, the DA has struggled to shake off an image as a party of white privilege - a notion that its leaders firmly reject.\n\nWestern Cape - the province the DA has controlled since 2009 - has done measurably better than the rest of South Africa. It boasts the country's lowest jobless rate. Its main city Cape Town is a major tourist destination. Even the country's notorious power cuts are less severe.\n\nStill, ANC supporters like Virginia Hili, 58, from East London are wary.\n\n\"We know that economic stability is important, and we see that Cape Town is better when it comes to job opportunities,\" she said.\n\n\"But we don't know what the ANC will promise the DA in return for its support,\" added Hili, who could not be drawn into specifying the potential concessions she was concerned the DA might get.\n\nBAD BLOOD\n\nMindful of alienating its support base, the ANC said on Wednesday it was leaning towards a government of national unity including several parties, even though internal party documents label such an option as a highly unstable alliance unlikely to last long.\n\nA narrower coalition with the DA that would have given it top parliamentary jobs was rejected outright by the party leadership, party officials said.\n\nThe ANC will have 159 seats out of 400 in the new National Assembly, while the DA will have 87.\n\nThe populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, will have 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance nine.\n\nAll of these potential partners present complications for the ANC.\n\nZuma, whose MK party finished a surprising third in the May 29 vote, was forced to quit as president in 2018 following a series of corruption scandals. He was later jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption and was barred from running for parliament.\n\nHe is now an implacable rival of President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the ANC said he had rebuffed its approaches to talk.\n\nPolitical analysts believe the EFF, led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, may be the most natural fit for the ANC.\n\nBut they warn that EFF policy proposals, including nationalising mines and banks and seizing white-owned land for redistribution to Black farmers, could tank the economy.\n\nThe EFF leader's history of bitter feuds with the ANC could lead to instability were Malema's party brought in to help govern, ANC supporter Molokwane said.\n\n\"I don't know if there would be peace,\" said Molokwane. \"It's tough. I don't know what is going to happen.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Johnnie Isaac in East London; Writing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Joe Bavier and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "source":

It won 159 seats in the 400-seat parliament, down from 230 in the previous election.\n\nIt is the first time the ANC has lost its majority since Nelson Mandela led the party to victory in the first democratic elections after Apartheid ended in 1994. Opponents have accused the government of failing to fulfill its \"better life for all\" promise, citing persistent crime, poverty, and high unemployment rates in Africa's most industrialized economy.\n\nThe center-right DA received 22% of the vote, equating to 87 seats; former President Jacob Zuma's left-wing MK won 15%, with 58 seats; and the radical Economic Freedom Fighters received 9%, taking 39 seats.\n\n\"The results indicate that the South Africans want all parties to work together, because no party received an absolute majority to form a government alone at national level, in Gauteng and in KwaZulu-Natal,\" the ANC spokesperson stated on Wednesday.\n\nThe ANC said it has discussed various alliance options, including forming a government of \"national unity\" with parties interested in contributing ideas on how to collectively move the country forward while preserving \"constitutional democracy.\"\n\nSouth African leader Cyril Ramaphosa is running for a second term, and some sort of agreement must be reached to allow parliament, which convenes in less than two weeks, to elect a president.\n\nAnalysts cited by the Associated Press (AP) have warned against the ANC's move to form a coalition with the DA and the MK and EFF - the latter two of which were formed in 2013 and 2023, respectively - after their founding leaders broke away from the ANC.\n\nThe ruling party risks alienating some of its key and traditional supporters if it enters into an alliance with the three major opposition parties, the analysts reportedly claimed.\n\nMeanwhile, the MK Party, which repeatedly accused the government of intimidation in the run-up to the elections, has declared that it will \"not negotiate with the ANC.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType":

"body": "South Africa's ruling ANC party was holding internal talks on Thursday to decide how to form a government, after it failed to win an outright majority in last week's general election.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress won 40 percent of the vote -- its lowest score ever -- and for the first time since the advent of democracy in 1994 needs the backing of other parties.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Ramaphosa quipped to reporters, as he arrived at a hotel on the outskirts of Johannesburg where the ANC's decision-making body was meeting. \"Are you that worried?\"\n\nThe party of late anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela is divided over who to share power with, analysts say.\n\nIt will have only 159 members in the 400-seat National Assembly, down from 230 in 2019.\n\nOn Wednesday, ANC spokeswoman Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said the top leadership favoured forming a broad coalition for a government of national unity.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board because South Africans want us to work together for their sake,\" ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBut observers say this might be hard to pull off given radical differences between some groups that should be part of it.\n\n\"I cannot... see how it can really work,\" analyst and author Susan Booysen told AFP.\n\n\"There is just so much bad blood and ill feeling between different political parties.\"\n\nAmong them are the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), which won 87 seats with a liberal, free-market agenda, and the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which secured 39 lawmakers and supports land redistribution and the nationalisation of key economic sectors.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the ANC was in discussions also with the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which will hold 17 seats, and the anti-immigration Patriotic Alliance (PA) that will have nine.\n\nThe ANC also \"repeatedly\" reached out to former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which won 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 seats, but received no response.\n\nZuma, a former ANC chief, has long been bitter about the way he was ousted under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018.\n\nThe MK, which was only established late last year, has rejected the election results and said it would not back an ANC-led government if Ramaphosa remains at the helm.\n\nBut the president's party plans to keep him.\n\n- 'Outcry' -\n\nAnalyst Daniel Silke said the ANC was likely floating the idea of a \"broad church\" government to appease some members before veering towards a narrower coalition if national unity talks failed.\n\nMany within the party oppose a deal with the DA, which is favoured by investors and the business community but has policies at odds with the ANC's left-wing traditions.\n\nReports suggesting the ANC was considering forming a minority government with external backing from the DA caused a \"huge outcry\", said Booysen.\n\nOutside the hotel where the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) was meeting, a handful of protesters held signs reading \"Not in our name. #NotwiththeDA\".\n\nThe South African Communist Party, an historic ally of the ANC, also said it was against any arrangement with \"the right-wing, DA-led anti-ANC neo-liberal forces\".\n\nTogether the ANC and the DA hold a comfortable majority in parliament.\n\nAny agreement with the EFF would instead require the support of at least another party.\n\nThe new parliament is to meet in less than two weeks and one of its first tasks will be to elect a president to form a new government.\n\nzam-ub/kjm", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters.\n\nMbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nSouth Africa has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption.\n\nThe electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39.\n\nThe new parliament has to convene within two weeks of results being declared and one of its first acts must be to elect the president.\n\nThe constitutional deadline, which will fall on or near June 16, is putting pressure on the ANC and others to reach agreement quickly.\n\nOptions could include a coalition government, a minority ANC government with backing on key votes from other parties in exchange for policy concessions, or a government of national unity.\n\nANC'S DIFFICULT SEARCH FOR PARTNERS\n\n\"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nA group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards reading \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC said on Wednesday it would not talk to anyone who demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining an alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.

The populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, will have 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance (PA) nine.\n\n\"If the (ANC's) idea is also to extend an invitation to all parties above a certain threshold to serve in the executive, which would include MK, the EFF and the PA, our negotiating team will not be empowered to conclude such an arrangement,\" said DA spokesperson Werner Horn.\n\n\"The current decision is that we will not join these parties in a government,\" he said, adding that any change of position would have to be agreed by the party's federal governing bodies.\n\nAn EFF spokesperson declined to comment on whether it was prepared to take part in a government of national unity.\n\nSouth Africa's rand currency weakened in volatile trade after the ANC's comments, and weakened further after the DA's reaction, reflecting market anxiety over the political uncertainty.\n\nAn internal ANC discussion paper, verified by Reuters on Wednesday, said a unity government was the most inclusive option and would allow the ANC to avoid choosing a coalition partner that may be unpopular with its base.\n\nBut the document also said there was a risk such a government would be prone to instability and gridlock given the need to manage many partners with widely varying interests.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the ANC was aiming to unite the broadest range of sectors in society behind the future government and the timescale for wrapping up talks was less than a week.\n\nShe also said that the ANC leader, President Cyril Ramaphosa, would stay in office and warned other parties against demanding his ousting as a condition for joining the government.\n\n\"He has shepherded this ship of the ANC and team South Africa very well,\" she told state broadcaster SABC.\n\n\"So our president is going nowhere. And anyone that intimates the thought about 'we are willing to go into a coalition with you but get rid of President Cyril Ramaphosa' can forget talking to us,\" she said.\n\nThe business sector and investors have a strong preference for the ANC doing a deal with the DA, which is strongly pro-business and advocates scrapping some of the ANC's Black empowerment policies on the basis that they haven't worked. However, such a deal would likely be unpopular with the ANC's base.\n\nThe South African Communist Party, a major ally of the ANC, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was \"against seeking a coalition arrangement with the right-wing, DA-led anti-ANC neo-liberal forces\".\n\nThe powerful COSATU trade union group - another ANC backer - has also voiced misgivings about a coalition with the DA.\n\nThe EFF's proposals in contrast, which include nationalising mines and banks and seizing land from white landowners, mean that it is viewed as a bad option by markets and the private sector, but more favourably by many ANC supporters.\n\nPA spokesman Steve Motale, meanwhile, said his party was open to joining any government that delivers on its main campaign promises, chief among them the \"mass deportation of all illegal immigrants.\"\n\n\"The ANC's concern is of course how to make this work right now, but it's also how to get their voters back in two years from now for the local government election and then also five years from now (for the next national election),\" said political analyst Melanie Verwoerd, a former ANC lawmaker.\n\n\"It's also Cyril Ramaphosa's happy space. This is what he's used to negotiate, he likes this sort of broad-based coalition,\" she said, referring to Ramaphosa's role in negotiating a 1994-1997 national unity government.\n\nThe ANC's Bhengu-Motsiri said the ANC had approached Zuma's MK party, which came a surprisingly strong third in the election, but had been rebuffed.\n\n\"Our door remains open,\" she said.\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 following a series of corruption scandals, and was later jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption. He is now an implacable enemy of Ramaphosa.\n\nZuma remains popular in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police were being deployed to maintain public order, according to a statement late on Tuesday by the South African Police Service.\n\nThe province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.", "source": {"uri": "nation.africa", "dataType": "news",

The party is seeking a government of national unity amid economic challenges, political corruption, and divisions within its own ranks.\n\nAfrican National Congress leaders held talks on Thursday to try to agree on potential partners to form a new South African government after the party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in the democratic era. The former liberation movement has run South Africa since it swept to power with Nelson Mandela at the helm in the 1994 election that marked the end of apartheid, but was punished for its chequered record in last week's election.\n\nWhile still the largest party, the ANC can no longer govern alone and signalled on Wednesday it would seek to form a government of national unity with a wide range of parties. \"This is a time for sober minds,\" said ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula as members of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) gathered in Johannesburg for a day of talks.\n\n\"We're not dealing with the discussions from a point of view of locking ourselves into one option. We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters. Mbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nSouth Africa has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption. The electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39. The new parliament has to convene within two weeks of results being declared and one of its first acts must be to elect the president.\n\nThe constitutional deadline, which will fall on or near June 16, is putting pressure on the ANC and others to reach agreement quickly. Options could include a coalition government, a minority ANC government with backing on key votes from other parties in exchange for policy concessions, or a government of national unity.\n\nANC'S DIFFICULT SEARCH FOR PARTNERS \"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF. Any deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nA group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards reading \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\". On the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\". The ANC said on Wednesday it would not talk to anyone who demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining an alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\" Zuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.

As leaders of political parties and those who occupy positions of responsibility in society, we have heard the voices of our people, and we must respect their choices and their wishes,\" he said.\n\nThis challenge couldn't have arisen at a more critical moment, as the ruling party has been grappling with internal conflicts and poor governance issues, which have let down many of its traditional voters.\n\nThe election results have left the ANC in a challenging position, prompting it to seek support from other parties to form a coalition government.\n\nWhile many political analysts argue that aligning with the DA could benefit the country's economic future, they also point out policy differences between the two parties.\n\nThe DA advocates for free-market principles, opposes certain empowerment policies, and strongly opposes the newly formed National Health Insurance policy. Additionally, it supports reducing the government workforce, cutting bureaucracy, and abolishing the minimum wage.\n\nTo complicate matters further, the ANC and DA have different foreign policies.\n\nWhile the ANC maintains longstanding relations with Palestine and Russia, the DA opposes these alliances and criticises South Africa's membership in BRICS, the intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and more recently Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAssociate Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Johannesburg, Prof Bhaso Ndzendze, highlighted the potential challenges:\n\n\"There are numerous landmines that both the DA and ANC will have to navigate. While they may align on domestic issues, they cannot anticipate the nature of the next international crisis.\"\n\nProf Ndzendze also noted that while the ANC shares some sentiments with the EFF, the latter party takes a more radical approach.\n\nFor example, the EFF calls for South Africa to sever ties with Eswatini over alleged human rights abuses and wants the Southern African Development Community to condemn the king Mswati III's actions as a war crime.\n\nNelson Mandela University political analyst Ongama Mtimka told The New Arab that the ANC's decline has been evident due to dissatisfaction with government services and the emergence of splinter parties like Congress of the People, EFF, and the newly formed MK in 2024.\n\nMtimka suggested that the formation of MK by former President Jacob Zuma dealt a significant blow to the ANC. Despite Zuma's corruption scandals, he was able to attract voters at the expense of his former party (the ANC).\n\nMtimka stated, \"Yes, President Zuma faces numerous corruption cases, but he is a very popular leader who has used his political capital to advance the electoral fortunes of the MK party.\"\n\nOn Thursday, June 6, 2024, Ramaphosa and senior ANC officials met for coalition talks.\n\nWhile Ramaphosa and other top ANC leaders negotiate for a coalition government, some notable members of the party have openly expressed dislike for the move.\n\nLindiwe Sisulu, a current ANC member of the National Executive Committee who formerly served as a minister of various portfolios, opposes any coalition involving the DA, claiming the party represents former colonists and oppressors.\n\nSisulu told journalists, \"In all the time I spent in prison fighting apartheid, I did not do it for the DA. The DA epitomizes what the previous government represented. The idea that black parties cannot govern is very racist. It is an insult for people who oppressed us and threw us in jail for fighting for justice to tell us that we can't govern.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Siphiwe Nyanda, an ANC stalwart, Veterans League member, and former chairman of the uMkhonto weSizwe Council, blames Zuma for the poor governance and corruption that marked his nine-year presidency.\n\nNyanda wrote a letter this week urging his party never to accept working with Zuma.\n\n\"Look at the ANC now. It is carrying a begging bowl, scrambling for coalition partners it would have never needed were it not for Jacob Zuma and his disastrous leadership. Now that Zuma has inflicted so much damage on the ANC from the outside, there is a rush to bring him back by his accomplices still embedded in the leadership of the ANC so that he can finish his job of destroying the once-proud liberation movement of the oppressed people of South Africa. These attempts must be firmly rejected.

NotWithTheDA.\"\n\nA deal with the DA is favoured by the business community and global investors, but some ANC supporters see it as a potential throwback to South Africa's painful past.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to see the white minority running the country again after what they did to us during apartheid,\" said Rosebella Joyi, a 90 year-old ANC supporter from East London, a city in the southeast.\n\nIn a country with a history of codified racism where white South Africans make up just 7% of the population of 62 million, the DA has struggled to shake off an image as a party of white privilege - a notion that its leaders firmly reject.\n\nWestern Cape - the province the DA has controlled since 2009 - has done measurably better than the rest of South Africa. It boasts the country's lowest jobless rate. Its main city Cape Town is a major tourist destination. Even the country's notorious power cuts are less severe.\n\nStill, ANC supporters like Virginia Hili, 58, from East London are wary.\n\n\"We know that economic stability is important, and we see that Cape Town is better when it comes to job opportunities,\" she said.\n\n\"But we don't know what the ANC will promise the DA in return for its support,\" added Hili, who could not be drawn into specifying the potential concessions she was concerned the DA might get.\n\nBAD BLOOD\n\nMindful of alienating its support base, the ANC said on Wednesday it was leaning towards a government of national unity including several parties, even though internal party documents label such an option as a highly unstable alliance unlikely to last long.\n\nA narrower coalition with the DA that would have given it top parliamentary jobs was rejected outright by the party leadership, party officials said.\n\nThe ANC will have 159 seats out of 400 in the new National Assembly, while the DA will have 87.\n\nThe populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, will have 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance nine.\n\nAll of these potential partners present complications for the ANC.\n\nZuma, whose MK party finished a surprising third in the May 29 vote, was forced to quit as president in 2018 following a series of corruption scandals. He was later jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption and was barred from running for parliament.\n\nHe is now an implacable rival of President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the ANC said he had rebuffed its approaches to talk.\n\nPolitical analysts believe the EFF, led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, may be the most natural fit for the ANC.\n\nBut they warn that EFF policy proposals, including nationalising mines and banks and seizing white-owned land for redistribution to Black farmers, could tank the economy.\n\nThe EFF leader's history of bitter feuds with the ANC could lead to instability were Malema's party brought in to help govern, ANC supporter Molokwane said.\n\n\"I don't know if there would be peace,\" said Molokwane. \"It's tough. I don't know what is going to happen.\" (Additional reporting by Johnnie Isaac in East London; Writing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Joe Bavier and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "source": {"uri":

They noted that the DA is opposed to some of South Africa's labour regulations and wants to freeze the minimum wage, allowing it to erode over time.\n\nThe DA is a leader of \"neo-liberal forces, highly supported by dominant sections of capital, mainly the white bourgeoisie whose roots can be traced to the era of colonial and apartheid oppression of the Black majority,\" the SACP said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Africa's ANC vows to keep Cyril Ramaphosa in presidency as coalition talks begin\n\nA group of ANC members, organizing under the hashtag #NotWithTheDA, have launched a petition to oppose the move and are planning a protest outside a crucial meeting of the ANC's national executive committee on Thursday.\n\nLindiwe Sisulu, a former South African foreign minister and current member of the ANC's national executive committee, told local media that any agreement with the DA would be an \"insult\" and a disaster. \"In all the time I spent in prison fighting apartheid, I did not do it for the DA,\" she told the Independent Media newspaper group. \"The DA is the epitome of what the previous [apartheid] government represented.\"\n\nWhile an informal minority-government arrangement is still on the table as an option, the ANC is also exploring a potential \"national unity\" government: a coalition agreement with a broad range of parties, including the radical left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the third-biggest opposition party, which has been eager for a coalition deal.\n\nThe ANC confirmed on Wednesday that it has already held discussions with five opposition parties, including the DA and the EFF. \"The ANC is keen and determined to engage all parties and unite the broadest range of sectors of our population behind the urgent need to move our country out of the current potential electoral stalemate,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIt acknowledged, however, that it failed to secure a meeting with the MK Party, led by former president Jacob Zuma, which won almost 15 per cent of the vote and became the second-biggest opposition party, despite being formed only six months ago.\n\nThe ANC could cobble together a majority in parliament if it forges an agreement with the EFF and one or two smaller parties - an agreement that would be attractive to its left-wing factions. This scenario has already sparked alarm among foreign investors and currency markets. South Africa's currency, the rand, lost about 1.3 per cent of its value on Wednesday, falling to almost 19 to the U.S. dollar.\n\nMr. Zuma, meanwhile, has repeatedly alleged - without evidence - that the election was rigged against him. His party said it will reject any agreement with the ANC unless it gets rid of its leader, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced Mr. Zuma in 2018 after a corruption scandal.\n\nThe party's rhetoric has sparked fears of violence, since Mr. Zuma's supporters rioted and looted across the country in 2021 when he was briefly jailed on contempt-of-court charges.\n\nThe ANC insists it will keep Mr. Ramaphosa as president. And the DA has said it cannot join any coalition with Mr. Zuma or the EFF, describing the two parties as the \"doomsday coalition\" because of their demands for nationalization and land expropriation.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He wrote, \"Rha!DA Sies,\" \"Don't Bed With Genocide Supporters,\" and \"Not in Our Name\".\n\nSpeaking to News24 on Wednesday, Hasane said the picket will take place at 08:00 on the same day that national executive committee members are scheduled to meet in Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg on Thursday. The ANC's national working committee met late on Tuesday for an update on the talks held so far.\n\nREAD | COALITION NATION: ANC approaches MK Party for meeting but gets no response\n\nExplaining his stance, Hasane said: \"In most cases than not, what informs DA policy is an ideal world that they only live in, and that does not benefit the majority of South Africans.\n\n\"I know for a fact that when they are in government, they cannot scrap these policies that already exist, but they will make sure that they are undermined or underdeveloped, so any coalition that has the DA is going to embolden the racist white company owner in South Africa to resist employment equity, minimum wage and the protection of workers because they know that at a national level, they know that they have someone who has their racist back, basically.\"\n\nHasane believes the DA coalition \"is probably a last straw\" to any ANC member.\n\nHe said:\n\nNews24 reported that there is growing discontent within some structures, with some expressing that the DA was an extension of the National Party.\n\nBriefing the media on Wednesday afternoon, SACP general-secretary Solly Mapaila campaigned against the \"anti-worker, neo-liberal and corrupt state captured networks\".\n\n\"We will maintain the strategic consistency of the SACP, which is against seeking coalition agreements with the right-wing, anti-people, anti-worker, and neoliberal forces led by the DA on the one hand, and on the other hand, state capture forces that are characterised by gangster politics as well as criminality and mafia,\" said Mapaila.\n\nROLLING COVERAGE | SACP says no to ANC coalition with DA, MK Party\n\nHasane, who started mobilising support on Monday, said the DA was a replacement of the National Party.\n\n\"This is definitely a betrayal [to those who voted for the ANC] because when you vote, you are not only voting for something, you are making a statement against something.\"\n\nHe said he agreed with former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, who has urged the ANC to not be driven by \"investor-friendly\" coalitions and that most South Africans vote for parties with similar policies.\n\nMadonsela took to X on 2 June expressing a view that: \"An approach primarily driven by investor friendliness is why the ANC is in this mess in addition to the corruption worsened by state capture which affected energy security and other service delivery issues. To the ANC, please do not let the investor-friendly narrative determine your choice.\"\n\nREAD | Inside the ANC-DA-IFP plan to torpedo Zuma's MKP in KZN\n\nHasane added that, \"after the everything that the DA has done to undermine and weaken the ANC government and ensure that it is out of power, they cannot now reward them with working with them for successfully removing them. That is what is basically happening now\".\n\nHe charged:\n\nHasane said he refused to sit on social media platforms and watch the party he loves \"without expressing his disapproval\".\n\n\"If I have to decide later on whether I am staying or leading [sic] an ANC with the DA, then I would know that I said something. I did not only tweet about it.\"\n\nBecause the ANC has not made its decision on who it will co-govern with, Hasane said he will wait for an official announcement to be made. \"We just want them to know that while they are talking, we are not happy. If we have to approach people, we will approach them after they have made their decision\".\n\nIn a statement shared on X, the #NotWiththeDA movement said it will tell NEC members to \"ignore, reject, and resist attempts to influence\" them towards a DA coalition agreement.\n\nThe DA was rejected by 80% of voters in May 2024 due to their regressive stance on progressive policies aimed at advancing the rights of the majority and addressing past imbalances caused by colonialism and apartheid.\"\n\nA prominent communications consultant and social commentator, who asked to remain anonymous, urged ANC leaders to stop negotiating with the \"enemy\".\n\n\"They should rather spend their energy engaging progressive forces, who are interested in the liberation of the black majority.\"\n\nThe woman said she opposed the marriage primarily because \"the DA is a racist organisation that has no common elements with the ANC. We cannot be seen collaborating with the enemy. It goes against everything that I stand for as a person.\"\n\nShe said it was important for ANC members to express their displeasure on Thursday.\n\n\"It's important because we started to speak out before the election that they should distance themselves from these utterances that Helen Zille and John Steenhuisen have been making, talking about courting the ANC and such, and if such discussions had taken place before the elections, we were like: 'Well these people are making it very clear discussions are happening and therefore, you should distance yourselves from any notion of this and assure the public, ANC voters and members.' The people deserve to know what they are getting themselves into, with voting for the ANC,\" she said.\n\nShe added:\n\nIn a statement, the South African Students' Congress (Sasco) in Gauteng said it also \"rejects any coalition dining hall talks with the racist-capitalist and anti-social transformation\" DA.\n\nREAD | Ditching Ramaphosa a 'no-go area' for ANC in coalition talks, says Fikile Mbalula\n\nSasco provincial chair Yandisa Mhlelembana said: \"SASCO Gauteng notes the rise of the rightwing DA and counter-revolutionary forces in ushering in a new apartheid with the same content and form yet with dissimilar faces.\n\n\"We shall mobilise Cosas, student movements which think alike, NGOs, progressive gender formations, churches and the rest of society to counter the doomsday coalition of the old apartheid order of Tony Leon and big business.\"\n\nA source close to President Cyril Ramaphosa said the ANC/DA coalition was \"the best option\".\n\n\"The president won't allow people to interfere with institutions. He will not allow any interference with the NPA, Hawks, SARS, or SIU. It hasn't happened throughout his Presidency. They want to remove the president because they want to cripple the NPA, SARS, SSA and other law enforcement agencies that are dealing with some of their cases. This is not about the president, it's about accessing state resources unlawfully. The president is the wall between them and the intention of crippling these institutions.\"\n\nOn coalitions, the source said the DA, ANC partnership was \"the best option\".\n\n\"It's the best option we have for the stability of the country and sustainability of the reforms that we have started. That is the best partnership we can look at, and, by the way, the initial informal reach out with the DA has not shown that the issues they want are unreasonable.\n\n\"They have not even spoken about positions. They have spoken about issues and gone straight into substance to say they would like to have a relook at how NHI is structured. That's not unreasonable. They would like to relook some elements of the Bela Bill, that's not unreasonable. They will probably want to agree to a common approach in terms of economic growth, that's not unreasonable.\"\n\nREAD | EFF seeks constitutional damages over forced removals from 'compromised' Zuma's SONAs\n\nThe source went on to say the DA has not said anything so far, informally, about BEE.\n\n\"They have not said anything informally about foreign policy. What they have put on the table informally so far is not unreasonable. They have not said anything about the Basic Income Grant, and anybody in their right mind who wants to co-govern South Africa will not mess around with the BIG. The BIG is also a process that is being workshopped, and no matter what your ideologies are, you cannot be completely desensitised to the levels of poverty that exist in the country.\n\n\"The bottom line is that right now, they have not presented on the table anything that is a deal breaker. Whereas others have put demands on the table things publicly, elements that will undermine the Constitution, the rule of law, and so you have to say then, other than the ideological disposition, in terms of facts, until formal negotiations start, so far there is nothing that indicates any bit of unreasonable [demands] from the DA.\"\n\nBriefing the media after Tuesday's NWC meeting, ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri revealed that the party has so far met with the Patriotic Alliance, IFP, DA, and NFP to negotiate forming a government.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said efforts to reach out to former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party had yielded no response.\n\nThe ANC has also met with its alliance parties, including the SACP and Sanco.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com",

We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters.\n\nMbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nSouth Africa has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption.\n\nThe electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39.\n\nThe new parliament has to convene within two weeks of results being declared and one of its first acts must be to elect the president.\n\nThe constitutional deadline, which will fall on or near June 16, is putting pressure on the ANC and others to reach agreement quickly.\n\nOptions could include a coalition government, a minority ANC government with backing on key votes from other parties in exchange for policy concessions, or a government of national unity.\n\nANC'S DIFFICULT SEARCH FOR PARTNERS\n\n\"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nA group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards reading \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC said on Wednesday it would not talk to anyone who demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining an alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Alexander Winning; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up\n\nView all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

The ANC lost its long-held majority in last week's vote but remained the biggest party. An ANC spokesperson said Wednesday that [...]\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was meeting with senior officials of the African National Congress on Thursday to decide how to go about forming a government after the party lost its 30-year grip on power and left a post-election deadlock.\n\nThe party's National Executive Committee was meeting in Johannesburg to work through a split within the party's ranks over which direction to take. ANC lost its long-held majority in last week's vote but remained the biggest party, and now needs some form of agreement with others to run Africa's most industrialized country.\n\nANC has indicated it's leaning toward a government of national unity that would bring together many of the political parties in a broad agreement, rather than a direct coalition with the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance, or DA.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board,\" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said before Thursday's meeting, which was likely to last all day. Mbalula said a government of national unity was being proposed to the NEC to decide on, but he expected there to be debate and disagreement.\n\nANC is the party that was once led by Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule by winning the country's historic first all-race vote in 1994. It had seen a gradual decline in its support over the last 20 years as South Africa struggles with high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality.\n\nThe National Executive Committee that includes more than 80 of the ANC's top officials is expected to be the body to decide on which direction it will take.\n\nThere's no guarantee that all the other parties will accept the idea of a government of national unity, even as South Africa's political leaders are under some time pressure to decide on the way forward as the newly elected Parliament must sit for the first time by June 16, with one of its first priorities to elect a president.\n\nThe South African president is seeking a second term in office, and the agreement being sought will also decide if Ramaphosa is reelected. South African elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers then elect the president. Because ANC only won 40% of the vote and lost its parliamentary majority for the first time, it needs others to join with it to reelect Ramaphosa for his final term.\n\nA coalition between ANC and the centrist DA had been touted as the likeliest option to co-govern South Africa as the two would hold a clear majority after DA won the second biggest share of the vote with 21%.\n\nBut that has met resistance from grassroots ANC structures as well as some of its political allies, like South Africa's congress of trade unions.\n\nDA could also be opposed to a wide-ranging agreement involving many political parties given it has insisted it will never work with two of them -- the new populist MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. They won the third and fourth biggest shares of the vote.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name":

He wrote, \"Rha!DA Sies,\" \"Don't Bed With Genocide Supporters,\" and \"Not in Our Name\".\n\nSpeaking to News24 on Wednesday, Hasane said the picket will take place at 08:00 on the same day that national executive committee members are scheduled to meet in Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg on Thursday. The ANC's national working committee met late on Tuesday for an update on the talks held so far.\n\nExplaining his stance, Hasane said: \"In most cases than not, what informs DA policy is an ideal world that they only live in, and that does not benefit the majority of South Africans.\n\n\"I know for a fact that when they are in government, they cannot scrap these policies that already exist, but they will make sure that they are undermined or underdeveloped, so any coalition that has the DA is going to embolden the racist white company owner in South Africa to resist employment equity, minimum wage and the protection of workers because they know that at a national level, they know that they have someone who has their racist back, basically.\"\n\nHasane believes the DA coalition \"is probably a last straw\" to any ANC member.\n\nHe said:\n\nI am not going to sit alongside my friends and try to convince them that the ANC is an alternative if it is with the DA. I cannot justify Helen Zille and John Steenhuisen in the DA.\n\nNews24 reported that there is growing discontent within some structures, with some expressing that the DA was an extension of the National Party.\n\nBriefing the media on Wednesday afternoon, SACP general-secretary Solly Mapaila campaigned against the \"anti-worker, neo-liberal and corrupt state captured networks\".\n\n\"We will maintain the strategic consistency of the SACP, which is against seeking coalition agreements with the right-wing, anti-people, anti-worker, and neoliberal forces led by the DA on the one hand, and on the other hand, state capture forces that are characterised by gangster politics as well as criminality and mafia,\" said Mapaila.\n\nHasane, who started mobilising support on Monday, said the DA was a replacement of the National Party.\n\n\"This is definitely a betrayal [to those who voted for the ANC] because when you vote, you are not only voting for something, you are making a statement against something.\"\n\nHe said he agreed with former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, who has urged the ANC to not be driven by \"investor-friendly\" coalitions and that most South Africans vote for parties with similar policies.\n\nMadonsela took to X on 2 June expressing a view that: \"An approach primarily driven by investor friendliness is why the ANC is in this mess in addition to the corruption worsened by state capture which affected energy security and other service delivery issues. To the ANC, please do not let the investor-friendly narrative determine your choice.\"\n\nHasane added that, \"after the everything that the DA has done to undermine and weaken the ANC government and ensure that it is out of power, they cannot now reward them with working with them for successfully removing them. That is what is basically happening now\".\n\nHe charged:\n\nFor me, whatever the ANC is going to do, especially if it has to decide with the DA, it would be a deciding factor on whether or not I am staying with the ANC or not.\n\nHasane said he refused to sit on social media platforms and watch the party he loves \"without expressing his disapproval\".\n\n\"If I have to decide later on whether I am staying or leading [sic] an ANC with the DA, then I would know that I said something. I did not only tweet about it.\"\n\nBecause the ANC has not made its decision on who it will co-govern with, Hasane said he will wait for an official announcement to be made. \"We just want them to know that while they are talking, we are not happy. If we have to approach people, we will approach them after they have made their decision\".\n\nIn a statement shared on X, the #NotWiththeDA movement said it will tell NEC members to \"ignore, reject, and resist attempts to influence\" them towards a DA coalition agreement.\n\nThe DA was rejected by 80% of voters in May 2024 due to their regressive stance on progressive policies aimed at advancing the rights of the majority and addressing past imbalances caused by colonialism and apartheid.\"\n\nA prominent communications consultant and social commentator, who asked to remain anonymous, urged ANC leaders to stop negotiating with the \"enemy\".\n\n\"They should rather spend their energy engaging progressive forces, who are interested in the liberation of the black majority.\"\n\nThe woman said she opposed the marriage primarily because \"the DA is a racist organisation that has no common elements with the ANC. We cannot be seen collaborating with the enemy. It goes against everything that I stand for as a person.\"\n\nShe said it was important for ANC members to express their displeasure on Thursday.\n\n\"It's important because we started to speak out before the election that they should distance themselves from these utterances that Helen Zille and John Steenhuisen have been making, talking about courting the ANC and such, and if such discussions had taken place before the elections, we were like: 'Well these people are making it very clear discussions are happening and therefore, you should distance yourselves from any notion of this and assure the public, ANC voters and members.' The people deserve to know what they are getting themselves into, with voting for the ANC,\" she said.\n\nShe added:\n\nAnd, we did not get answers prior to the elections. We still went ahead and voted for the ANC, in good faith, trusting the ANC not to negotiate with the oppressor and the enemy, and here we find ourselves in a situation where we must speak up.\n\nIn a statement, the South African Students' Congress (Sasco) in Gauteng said it also \"rejects any coalition dining hall talks with the racist-capitalist and anti-social transformation\" DA.\n\nSasco provincial chair Yandisa Mhlelembana said: \"SASCO Gauteng notes the rise of the rightwing DA and counter-revolutionary forces in ushering in a new apartheid with the same content and form yet with dissimilar faces.\n\n\"We shall mobilise Cosas, student movements which think alike, NGOs, progressive gender formations, churches and the rest of society to counter the doomsday coalition of the old apartheid order of Tony Leon and big business.\"\n\nA source close to President Cyril Ramaphosa said the ANC/DA coalition was \"the best option\".\n\n\"The president won't allow people to interfere with institutions. He will not allow any interference with the NPA, Hawks, SARS, or SIU. It hasn't happened throughout his Presidency. They want to remove the president because they want to cripple the NPA, SARS, SSA and other law enforcement agencies that are dealing with some of their cases. This is not about the president, it's about accessing state resources unlawfully. The president is the wall between them and the intention of crippling these institutions.\"\n\nOn coalitions, the source said the DA, ANC partnership was \"the best option\".\n\n\"It's the best option we have for the stability of the country and sustainability of the reforms that we have started. That is the best partnership we can look at, and, by the way, the initial informal reach out with the DA has not shown that the issues they want are unreasonable.\n\n\"They have not even spoken about positions. They have spoken about issues and gone straight into substance to say they would like to have a relook at how NHI is structured. That's not unreasonable. They would like to relook some elements of the Bela Bill, that's not unreasonable. They will probably want to agree to a common approach in terms of economic growth, that's not unreasonable.\"\n\nThe source went on to say the DA has not said anything so far, informally, about BEE.\n\n\"They have not said anything informally about foreign policy. What they have put on the table informally so far is not unreasonable. They have not said anything about the Basic Income Grant, and anybody in their right mind who wants to co-govern South Africa will not mess around with the BIG. The BIG is also a process that is being workshopped, and no matter what your ideologies are, you cannot be completely desensitised to the levels of poverty that exist in the country.\n\n\"The bottom line is that right now, they have not presented on the table anything that is a deal breaker. Whereas others have put demands on the table things publicly, elements that will undermine the Constitution, the rule of law, and so you have to say then, other than the ideological disposition, in terms of facts, until formal negotiations start, so far there is nothing that indicates any bit of unreasonable [demands] from the DA.\"\n\nBriefing the media after Tuesday's NWC meeting, ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri revealed that the party has so far met with the Patriotic Alliance, IFP, DA, and NFP to negotiate forming a government.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said efforts to reach out to former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party had yielded no response.\n\nThe ANC has also met with its alliance parties, including the SACP and Sanco.\\", "source": {"uri":

As the largest party, it seeks a unity government amidst economic struggles and internal dissension. The ANC must balance partnerships with various parties to maintain governance and public support.\n\nAfrican National Congress leaders began talks on Thursday to try to agree on potential partners to form a new South African government after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in the democratic era. The former liberation movement has run South Africa since it swept to power with Nelson Mandela at the helm in the 1994 election that marked the end of apartheid, but was punished for its chequered record in last week's election.\n\nWhile still the largest party, the ANC can no longer govern alone and signalled on Wednesday it would seek to form a government of national unity with a wide range of parties. \"This is a time for sober minds,\" said ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula as members of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) gathered at a Johannesburg hotel for a day of talks on what strategy to pursue.\n\n\"We're not dealing with the discussions from a point of view of locking ourselves into one option. We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters. Mbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nThe stakes are high for South Africa, which has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption. The electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39. \"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF. ANC COALITION-BUILDING HAS NO EASY ANSWER\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\". Underlining that dynamic, a group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards with slogans such as \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors. Both the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC spokesperson said on Wednesday the party would not talk to any counterparts that demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining a governing alliance. On Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption. He remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.

We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nA group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards reading \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC said on Wednesday it would not talk to anyone who demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining an alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Alexander Winning; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

Will he have the last laugh over Ramaphosa?", "body": "Former president of the ANC and South Africa Jacob Zuma, waves to supporters after casting his ballot on May 29 during general elections in Nkandla, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa's African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week's election.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind.\n\n\"The ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\" Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing.\n\nStill, some of the same parties that sought the ANC's demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa.\n\nFor decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday's elections, down from 57% in 2019.\n\nAnalysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party's staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC's traditional voter base.\n\nZuma's revenge\n\nZuma - a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa - was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since.\n\nHis MK party, named after the ANC's former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that - formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote.\n\nZuma positioned MK as \"a party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\" said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote.\n\n\"What we've seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who've supported it over the last 30 years,\" Dooms told CNN.\n\nDespite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old's face remained on the ballot paper.\n\nZuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \"Teflon President\" because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered.\n\nRamaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \"state capture\" - or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma's relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers.\n\nWith the ANC's popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa's political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have had the last laugh. But it is too early to tell.\n\nDue to the poor election showing, South Africa's political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government.\n\nIn many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa's constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together.\n\nAccording to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced.\n\nThe outcome of these talks will likely determine Ramaphosa's future as president, as his position likely depends on the outcome of these negotiations.\n\nRamaphosa's allies in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president's resignation is \"not going to happen.\"\n\n\"I think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government - both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\" Dooms told CNN.\n\nThe potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities.\n\nA marriage of convenience\n\nFirst, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years.\n\nLed by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC.\n\nA DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts.\n\n\"The only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition. Outside that, the other parties, MK and EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\" said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance.\n\nIf the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises.\n\nWhile in government, the ANC's flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE.\n\nThe\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering.\n\nIn contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \"Economic Justice Policy\" that \"targets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\"\n\nThe DA is also against the ANC's flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers.\n\nHowever, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa's constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC's deputy president, Paul Mashatile.\n\nIn a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \"confidence-and-supply\" agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions.\n\nA bitter pill to swallow?\n\nIf the ANC decides to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge.\n\nHowever, if South Africa's president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely.\n\nThe MK party's manifesto also demands an overhaul of the country's constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders.\n\nZuma \"unapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\"\u202fpolitical analyst and former ANC lawmaker Melanie Verwoerd told CNN.\n\nBy appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma's party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added.\n\nThe ANC's policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach.\n\nIt is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However, it has provided no evidence of voting irregularities.\n\nThe other option for a coalition is the EFF, led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank.\n\nMalema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy.\n\nSouth Africa's business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF-ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a \"doomsday\" option because of the potential impact on investment and trade.\n\nThe EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker.\n\nAside from a classic coalition deal or a \"confidence and supply\" agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \"government of national unity\" (GNU), bringing in all the major parties.\n\nThis scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution, led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents, between April 1994 and February 1997.\n\nWith less than two weeks to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa's political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa's leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma's dramatic comeback.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_mckenzie@cnn.com", "name":

NotWithTheDA.\"\n\nA deal with the DA is favoured by the business community and global investors, but some ANC supporters see it as a potential throwback to South Africa's painful past.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to see the white minority running the country again after what they did to us during apartheid,\" said Rosebella Joyi, a 90 year-old ANC supporter from East London, a city in the southeast.\n\nIn a country with a history of codified racism where white South Africans make up just 7% of the population of 62 million, the DA has struggled to shake off an image as a party of white privilege - a notion that its leaders firmly reject.\n\nWestern Cape - the province the DA has controlled since 2009 - has done measurably better than the rest of South Africa. It boasts the country's lowest jobless rate. Its main city Cape Town is a major tourist destination. Even the country's notorious power cuts are less severe.\n\nStill, ANC supporters like Virginia Hili, 58, from East London are wary.\n\n\"We know that economic stability is important, and we see that Cape Town is better when it comes to job opportunities,\" she said.\n\n\"But we don't know what the ANC will promise the DA in return for its support,\" added Hili, who could not be drawn into specifying the potential concessions she was concerned the DA might get.\n\nMindful of alienating its support base, the ANC said on Wednesday it was leaning towards a government of national unity including several parties, even though internal party documents label such an option as a highly unstable alliance unlikely to last long.\n\nA narrower coalition with the DA that would have given it top parliamentary jobs was rejected outright by the party leadership, party officials said.\n\nThe ANC will have 159 seats out of 400 in the new National Assembly, while the DA will have 87.\n\nThe populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, will have 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance nine.\n\nAll of these potential partners present complications for the ANC.\n\nZuma, whose MK party finished a surprising third in the May 29 vote, was forced to quit as president in 2018 following a series of corruption scandals. He was later jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption and was barred from running for parliament.\n\nHe is now an implacable rival of President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the ANC said he had rebuffed its approaches to talk.\n\nPolitical analysts believe the EFF, led by Julius Malema, a former leader of the ANC's youth wing, may be the most natural fit for the ANC.\n\nBut they warn that EFF policy proposals, including nationalising mines and banks and seizing white-owned land for redistribution to Black farmers, could tank the economy.\n\nThe EFF leader's history of bitter feuds with the ANC could lead to instability were Malema's party brought in to help govern, ANC supporter Molokwane said.\n\n\"I don't know if there would be peace,\" said Molokwane. \"It's tough. I don't know what is going to happen.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Johnnie Isaac in East London; Writing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Joe Bavier and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "source":

However, it is easy to underestimate just how difficult this will be for the ANC. It is also important to understand the DA's longer-term goal.\n\nIn the past few days, there has been much reportage and commentary about whether the ANC will enter into an agreement with the DA. While business groups won't explicitly say who they want the ANC to work with, it is clear they would prefer a coalition that does not involve the EFF and MK.\n\nConsidering that these parties say they want radical change and an expanded role for the government in SA's economy, the interests of business groups lie in the other direction.\n\nThe value of the rand and confidence in South Africa's economy is tied to perceptions of who the ANC will work with and it is indeed a decision of utmost importance.\n\nHowever, the racialised nature of some political discussions leads to angry questions about whether the \"markets\" can overrule the \"wishes of voters\".\n\nMany in South Africa perceive the \"markets\" as Western and thus white. As the majority of the country's voters are black and voted for the ANC, the EFF and MK, some may feel we are witnessing \"white markets\" trying to overrule \"black voters\".\n\nConsidering our history, this is a legitimate reaction.\n\nSouth Africa, however, is not the only country in which the markets can be perceived as having a political influence.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to resign, partly (or even mainly) because of the market reaction to a mini budget that included dramatic tax cuts.\n\nTo be clear, this was the markets punishing a white Conservative prime minister for being too right wing. These same markets welcomed her successor, Rishi Sunak.\n\nSo powerful are the markets in some democracies that Bill Clinton's adviser James Carville said, \"I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\"\n\nThis may be an indication that while markets don't vote, they still play a role everywhere in the world. In South Africa, the DA is seen as the markets' closest ally.\n\nIt was always going to be hard for the ANC to work with the DA.\n\nThere are many ways to look at this.\n\nThrough one prism, the ANC represents largely workers and there is now pressure on it to work with employers.\n\nOr, the ANC, which liberated the country, is now being pressured into working with a party supported by some of the people who benefited from apartheid (there is a difficult history in working with the IFP, too -- it was part of the homeland system which the ANC opposed).\n\nEven if the DA offers a deal in which it only gains more oversight, for many this might seem like the ANC needs a \"white overseer\" to be trusted.\n\nAll of this is about our past, about the humiliation that our history of pain has brought into our present and the fact our society is still defined by racialised inequality.\n\nThis might well inform the DA's deal.\n\nOn the face of it, the \"confidence and supply\" proposal which seemed to appear in public for the first time on Sunday (as if by magic...) is surely the best possible deal the ANC can get.\n\nIn short, this would involve the DA receiving the position of National Assembly Speaker and chairing parliamentary committees. In other words, it would give the DA much more oversight power, while not being in Cabinet.\n\nConsidering all other parties are likely to quite reasonably demand seats in Cabinet, this is a deal that would be hard to give up.\n\nIt may have been designed in this way specifically so that it is difficult for the ANC to ignore.\n\nHowever, it could contain longer-term problems for the ANC.\n\nAs former ANC treasurer Mathews Phosa told SAfm on Wednesday, if there was any deal with the DA, the ANC \"could kiss the local elections in the next 18 months' time goodbye\".\n\nA \"confidence and supply\" deal will absolve the DA from any blame should governance problems occur. It would be able to tell its voters that it was not supporting the ANC, it was merely keeping the EFF and MK out of power, and keeping the ANC on the straight and narrow away from the populist left wing).\n\nIt prevents the problem of a scandal involving one Cabinet minister reflecting badly on any other ministers, should they be DA members.\n\nIt ensures there are no difficult moments when the DA feels it has to withdraw its ministers over a major dispute (for example, the NHI or a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin).\n\nOn a cynical and racialised reading of recent events, the great victory for the DA in this election is that it has largely kept the \"white vote\" together.\n\nConsidering its \"burning flag\" election advert and how it reacted to newer players such as Rise Mzansi that may have taken some of these votes, this could have been the primary aim of this campaign.\n\nThe DA may be making a longer-term bet here.\n\nIt could assume that the ANC can only lose support from here. In just three years the ANC has to elect a new leader. It is unlikely that such a person will have anything like the broad support that President Cyril Ramaphosa still appears to enjoy.\n\nTo put this in terms of racial designations, if the DA can keep the \"white vote\" together while the \"black vote\" continues to split, it could one day emerge as the biggest party in Parliament.\n\nWhile this may not allow it to elect one of its own as President, it would still be an immense prize.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_grootes@dailymaverick.co.za",

There can no longer be a pretence that it alone represents \"the people\". It is now simply the largest among a host of ordinary political parties doing what ordinary political parties do: scrambling for votes, political power and influence.\n\nI have studied the ANC since the days of the liberation struggle and as a party in power.\n\nIn reality, any notion of the ANC embodying the people has been creaking for years. Those at odds with its leadership have peeled away to found new political parties. First there was Bantu Holomisa, who fell out with Nelson Mandela in 1996. More recently, in 2012, Julius Malema was expelled after supposedly bringing the ANC into disrepute. Malema founded the Economic Freedom Fighters to fight the election in 2014.\n\nOnly the Economic Freedom Fighters was to gain much political traction. But the message was clear: the coalition on which the ANC was based was becoming ever more fragile and could not last.\n\nHence the historical significance of the electoral eruption of the uMkhonto we Sizwe Party (MK Party) of Jacob Zuma, former president of both the ANC and South Africa. Prior to the 2024 election, Zuma's party was widely recognised as representing a threat to ANC hegemony, both nationally and provincially in KwaZulu-Natal. But the strength of its performance has taken South Africa (and the party itself) aback.\n\nWithin six months, and with only the rudiments of organisation stolen from the ANC itself, it has taken 14.5% of the national votes and 45% of the KwaZulu-Natal votes in its first election.\n\nFew can dispute that its rise is the most dramatic stage in the dissolution of the coalition which gave the ANC a claim to being a liberation movement.\n\nThe ANC's claim goes back to its foundation in 1912. It was a reaction to the formation of the Union of South Africa by white politicians and their exclusion of the majority black people from the right to vote or participate on equal terms with whites.\n\nAt its creation, the ANC (or the South African Native National Congress, as it was known until 1923) was the coming together of South Africa's black and Coloured population (in the old terminology): its diverse ethnic peoples, their chiefly representatives and the emerging African professionals and black middle class.\n\nThis culminated decades later in its leadership of the Congress Alliance, the bringing together of the ANC with the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress and the (largely white) Congress of Democrats.\n\nThe ANC's predominance among those fighting apartheid was to be briefly challenged by the breakaway of the Africanists grouped together as the Pan-Africanist Congress in 1959. But the threat dissipated during the long years of exile as the Pan-Africanist Congress collapsed into factionalism.\n\nBy the early 1990s, via its alliance with the South African Communist Party, and under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, the ANC could put forth a highly plausible claim to be the genuine representative of \"the people\". By this it meant the overwhelming majority of South Africans, of diverse colours and backgrounds, who were bound together by a commitment to \"non-racialism\" and who were oppressed by apartheid. This was confirmed by the ANC's performance in the 1994 election: 63% of the vote.\n\nIt could say that the non-racial and democratic South Africa which had emerged from the negotiation process with the apartheid regime was essentially the product of its own vision and imagination.\n\nIf any movement could lay claim to having \"liberated\" South Africa, it was the ANC. However, while aspiring to unity, the ANC was never a monolith. Indeed, it was precisely because it was always a coalescence of diverse tendencies, notably of communists and non-communists, and of \"Africanists\" and those committed to \"non-racialism\", that so much importance was attached to the notion of its being a \"liberation movement\".\n\nA political party was seen as just that: a grouping which represented just a \"part\" of the people. In contrast, the ANC was presented and viewed itself as embodying the essence of the people, the soul of the nation, and as capable of reconciling differences which might otherwise blow a historically and racially divided nation apart. It followed that those who opposed it were divisive.\n\nIn other words, there was always a tension at the heart of the ANC's notion of democracy. It was always a difficult balancing act. At one moment, it celebrated the diversity and plurality which found its form in a new constitution which was largely based on the tenets of liberal democracy. At another, it insisted on the unity of the nation under its own leadership, which was distinctly illiberal, even totalitarian.\n\nLiberal democracy presumed that the ANC's leadership of the nation could be displaced at an election. But the alternative notion of democracy suggested that it could not. If the ANC was \"the people\", how could \"the people\" overthrow the ANC?\n\nAt its height, reached in the 2004 election, the ANC swept just under 69.7% of the total vote. With Holomisa's United Democratic Movement winning 2.3%, the total vote for parties representing the historical tradition of the ANC amounted to 71%.\n\nIn the 2013 election, the total vote for the ANC tradition, made up of the ANC (62.15%), Economic Freedom Fighters (6.35%) and United Democratic Movement (1%), amounted to 69.5%. In 2019, the combined vote for the ANC (57.5%) and Economic Freedom Fighters (10.8%) remained much the same, at 68.3%. So it remains in 2024, with the combined vote for the ANC (40.18%), Economic Freedom Fighters (9.52%) and uMkhonto we Sizwe (14.59%) coming in at 64.3%.\n\nIn short, the ANC tradition remains dominant, but the ANC as a liberation movement does not.\n\nHerein lies much of the significance of the 2024 election. It is the ANC that has lost ground, not the ANC tradition. What has become divided could reunite. Or more likely, bits of it could reunite.\n\nA commitment to the form and values of the constitution is becoming the major fault-line in South Africa's politics, opening the potential for an alliance between uMkhonto we Sizwe, Economic Freedom Fighters and the remnants of the \"radical economic transformation\" faction within the ANC.\n\nThe more that looms, the greater the possibilities for a coming together of the constitutional element within the ANC, a progressive bloc within the main opposition Democratic Alliance, and other parties, the old (Inkatha Freedom Party) and the new, such as Rise Mzansi, which are committed to the values of 1994.\n\nNever has the future of South Africa's politics been more uncertain, but the one certainty that holds is that the ANC's standing as a liberation movement is dead. In effect, there are now two ANCs: the ANC of current leader Cyril Ramaphosa, and the ANC of Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema. They cannot both claim to represent \"the people\".\n\n- Death of a liberation movement: how South Africa's ANC became just a regular political party - with some help from Jacob Zuma\n\n-

Will he have the last laugh over Ramaphosa?", "body": "Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week's election.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC's national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind.\n\n\"The ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\" Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing.\n\nStill, some of the same parties that sought the ANC's demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa.\n\nFor decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday's elections, down from 57% in 2019.\n\nAnalysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party's staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC's traditional voter base.\n\nZuma - a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa - was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since.\n\nHis MK party, named after the ANC's former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that - formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote.\n\nZuma positioned MK as \"a party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\" said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote.\n\n\"What we've seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who've supported it over the last 30 years,\" Dooms told CNN.\n\nDespite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old's face remained on the ballot paper.\n\nZuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \"Teflon President\" because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered.\n\nRamaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \"state capture\" - or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma's relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers.\n\nWith the ANC's popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa's political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell.\n\nDue to the poor election showing, South Africa's political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government.\n\nIn many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa's constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together.\n\nAccording to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced.\n\nThe outcome of these talks will likely determine Ramaphosa's future as president.\n\nRamaphosa's allies in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president's resignation is \"not going to happen.\"\n\n\"I think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government - both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\" Dooms told CNN.\n\nThe potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities.\n\nFirst, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years.\n\nLed by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC.\n\nA DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts.\n\n\"The only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition. Outside that, the other parties, MK and EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\" said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance.\n\nIf the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises.\n\nWhile in government, the ANC's flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE.\n\nThe\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering.\n\nIn contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \"Economic Justice Policy\" that \"targets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\"\n\nThe DA is also against the ANC's flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers.\n\nHowever, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa's constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC's deputy president, Paul Mashatile.\n\nIn a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \"confidence-and-supply\" agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions.\n\nIf the ANC decides to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge.\n\nHowever, if South Africa's president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely.\n\nThe MK party's manifesto also demands an overhaul of the country's constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders.\n\nZuma \"unapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\"\u202fpolitical analyst and former ANC lawmaker Melanie Verwoerd told CNN.\n\nBy appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma's party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added.\n\nThe ANC's policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach.\n\nIt is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However, it has provided no evidence of voting irregularities.\n\nThe other option for a coalition is the EFF, led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank.\n\nMalema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy.\n\nSouth Africa's business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF-ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a \"doomsday\" option because of the potential impact on investment and trade.\n\nThe EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker.\n\nAside from a classic coalition deal or a \"confidence and supply\" agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \"government of national unity\" (GNU), bringing in all the major parties.\n\nThis scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution, led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents, between April 1994 and February 1997.\n\nWith less than two weeks to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa's political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa's leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma's dramatic comeback.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Africa's African National Congress may have said it's leaning towards forming a \"government of national unity\" - but there is a problem.\n\nThe other parties aren't exactly united.\n\nThe second largest party, for example, has said it won't work with some of the smaller ones.\n\nOn Wednesday (June 5), ANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said the ANC had been talking to five parties.\n\n\"...because this is what the people of South Africa have said to us, that put together a multi-party arrangement that works for the benefit of South Africa.\"\"\n\nThe ANC will have 159 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nThe pro-business Democratic Alliance is on 87.\n\nA surprisingly strong showing for the new MK Party, led by Jacob Zuma, gives it 58 while the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, got 39.\n\nThe socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party has 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance is on 9.\n\nThat's too broad an array of ideologies for some.\n\nDemocratic Alliance spokesperson Werner Horn said their current decision was that they would not join parties such as MK, the EFF or Patriotic Alliance in government.\n\nThe DA has previously called an ANC-EFF alliance a 'doomsday' scenario.\n\nThe business sector would prefer a deal with the free-marketeer DA - which refutes allegations that it is a party of white privilege.\n\nThe DA advocates scrapping some of the ANC's Black empowerment policies on the basis that they haven't worked.\n\nHowever, such a deal would likely be unpopular with the ANC's base.\n\nANC backers, including the South African Communist Party and the powerful COSATU trade union group, have voiced misgivings about a coalition with the DA.\n\nThe EFF's policies include nationalizing mines and banks and seizing land from white farmers.\n\nThey would be seen as a bad option by markets and the private sector.\n\nBut the party, led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, is viewed more favorably by many ANC supporters.\n\nAn EFF spokesperson declined to comment on whether it was prepared to take part in a government of national unity.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for the Patriotic Alliance said it was open to joining any government that delivers on its main campaign promises - chief among them the \"mass deportation of all illegal immigrants.\"\n\nThe ANC's Bhengu-Motsiri said an approach to Zuma's MK had been rebuffed.\n\nThe May 29 election saw the ANC lose its majority for the first time in three decades.\n\nThat was punishment from voters angry over persistent poverty, unemployment, crime, corruption and rolling power blackouts.\n\n\"They had the chance, they ruined it and now they've got no choice but to do it.\"\n\nThe ANC said the aim now was to unite the broadest range of sectors in society behind the future government and that the timescale for wrapping up talks over this tricky political puzzle was less than a week.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

I cannot imagine having to drag people who do not have similar issues and insights into our problems and be able to take the country forward,\" Sisulu said in an interview with the SABC.\n\nSuspicion about the DA's commitment to long-term alliances is at the heart of the controversy. Historically, the DA has shown a tendency to withdraw from agreements, exemplified by their departure from the multi-party charter prior to the election.\n\nThis behaviour has led to predictions that the multi-party charter will likely disintegrate after the elections. The smaller parties, having felt betrayed by the DA's past actions, project deep resentment and distrust towards the party.\n\nThis backdrop of broken promises casts doubt on the viability and stability of a coalition between the ANC and the DA, suggesting that such an alliance could be short-lived and fraught with discord.\n\nFurther complicating matters, if the ANC aligns with the DA, there is a palpable fear that DA leader John Steenhuisen, alongside his international supporters, would undermine President Cyril Ramaphosa's authority.\n\nThis could lead to a weakening of Ramaphosa's leadership and potentially precipitate the collapse of the ANC. The implications of such an outcome are dire, not only for the party but also for the nation, as it could lead to a significant political vacuum and instability.\n\nAdding to the complexity, the ongoing reports over the past 24 hours indicate a growing factionalism within the ANC. This internal strife is perceived as a threat to national unity, with many arguing that a split within the ANC could be catastrophic for South Africa's societal cohesion.\n\nThe unity forged over decades of shared struggle and governance is at risk of untying, which could lead to widespread unrest and disruption across the nation.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential departure of key ANC members over a coalition with the DA signals a turbulent future for South Africa.\n\nSuch a move could destabilise the longstanding political framework and undermine the progress achieved since the end of apartheid. It is imperative for the ANC to tread carefully, considering the broader implications of their coalition choices on the stability and unity of the country.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindiwe_Sisulu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lindiwe Sisulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multi-party system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steenhuisen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Steenhuisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_faction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political faction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiations_to_end_apartheid_in_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WhatsApp-Image-2024-06-05-at-10.34.52-PM-640x360.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

ANC lost its long-held majority in last week's vote but remained the biggest party, and now needs some form of agreement with others to run Africa's most industrialized country.\n\nANC has indicated it's leaning toward a government of national unity that would bring together many of the political parties in a broad agreement, rather than a direct coalition with the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance, or DA.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board,\" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said before Thursday's meeting, which was likely to last all day. Mbalula said a government of national unity was being proposed to the NEC to decide on, but he expected there to be debate and disagreement.\n\nANC is the party that was once led by Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule by winning the country's historic first all-race vote in 1994. It had seen a gradual decline in its support over the last 20 years as South Africa struggles with high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality.\n\nThe National Executive Committee that includes more than 80 of the ANC's top officials is expected to be the body to decide on which direction it will take.\n\nThere's no guarantee that all the other parties will accept the idea of a government of national unity, even as South Africa's political leaders are under some time pressure to decide on the way forward as the newly elected Parliament must sit for the first time by June 16, with one of its first priorities to elect a president.\n\nThe South African president is seeking a second term in office, and the agreement being sought will also decide if Ramaphosa is reelected. South African elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers then elect the president. Because ANC only won 40% of the vote and lost its parliamentary majority for the first time, it needs others to join with it to reelect Ramaphosa for his final term.\n\nA coalition between ANC and the centrist DA had been touted as the likeliest option to co-govern South Africa as the two would hold a clear majority after DA won the second biggest share of the vote with 21%.\n\nBut that has met resistance from grassroots ANC structures as well as some of its political allies, like South Africa's congress of trade unions.\n\nDA could also be opposed to a wide-ranging agreement involving many political parties given it has insisted it will never work with two of them -- the new populist MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. They won the third and fourth biggest shares of the vote.", "source": {"uri": "africanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Africanews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/48/33/36/1024x538_cmsv2_6bb7e70e-2696-5520-af19-fdc898a55763-8483336.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 1854, "textEnd": 1861}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - African National Congress leaders began talks on Thursday to try to agree on potential partners to form a new South African government after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in the democratic era.\n\nThe former liberation movement has run South Africa since it swept to power with Nelson Mandela at the helm in the 1994 election that marked the end of apartheid, but was punished for its chequered record in last week's election.\n\nWhile still the largest party, the ANC can no longer govern alone and signalled on Wednesday it would seek to form a government of national unity with a wide range of parties.\n\n\"This is a time for sober minds,\" said ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula as members of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) gathered at a Johannesburg hotel for a day of talks on what strategy to pursue.\n\n\"We're not dealing with the discussions from a point of view of locking ourselves into one option. We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters.\n\nMbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nThe stakes are high for South Africa, which has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption.\n\nThe electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39.\n\n\"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nANC COALITION-BUILDING HAS NO EASY ANSWER\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nUnderlining that dynamic, a group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards with slogans such as \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC spokesperson said on Wednesday the party would not talk to any counterparts that demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining a governing alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Alexander Winning; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) had won the previous elections with comfortable majorities, from a high of 70 percent in 2004 to a low of 57 percent in 2019. Not this time: the ANC is now in the minority.\n\nOver its three decades of political dominance, the ANC made some progress in providing social welfare, housing, electricity and piped water to millions of people. Although its total vote had fallen in each of the past four polls, it had never declined by more than 5 percentage points. However, this time the ANC lost 17 percentage points, receiving just 40.2 percent of the vote, which means it would have to govern as part of a coalition for the first time.\n\nThe ANC controlled eight of the country's nine provinces. The white-dominated Democratic Alliance (DA) controlled the tourist hub of the Western Cape, with its large mixed-race population, and had been making gains with the black middle class in the industrial heartland of Gauteng.\n\nThis time, the ANC lost its majority in two provinces, KwaZulu-Natal (home to one of Africa's largest ports) and Gauteng, rendering the ANC a rural party based on large majorities in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo. Although it still received nearly double the votes of the next largest party -- the DA won 21.8 percent -- this result represents a stunning reversal for the ANC.\n\nSo, what went wrong?\n\nThe main cause of the ANC's precipitous decline is its failure to reverse 32 percent unemployment, with nearly half of the country's young people out of work. After 350 years of colonialism and apartheid, South Africa remains the world's most unequal society, with 10 percent of the population controlling 80.6 percent of financial assets.\n\nWidespread corruption, particularly under former South African president Jacob Zuma's administration (2009 to 2018), has exacerbated the problem, with state capture during this period estimated to have cost the country US$26 billion.\n\nIn addition, state-owned enterprises have been looted, reducing the provision of electricity, water and train services. Even though the black middle class grew from 2.2 million in 1993 to 6 million in 2018, there remains a widespread perception that a tiny cohort of black billionaires used their ANC affiliations to benefit from cozy deals with white business.\n\nCrime also represents a major concern, as South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates. The ANC's support had already tanked at the local level, and before these polls, it governed only two of eight metropolitan municipalities, with the other six run by fractious coalitions.\n\nAt the same time, 82-year-old Zuma turned against the party he once dominated. His administration was excoriated by the Judicial Commission of Inquiry Into Allegations of State Capture for grand corruption (which Zuma has denied).\n\nMeanwhile, current South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Zuma's presidency \"eight wasted years.\" (Zuma retorted that Ramaphosa had been his deputy for four of those years.)\n\nHaving built up the ANC's comfortable majority on the back of his home province of KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma felt deeply aggrieved. Determined to give the party a bloody nose, he formed the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK, named after the ANC's paramilitary wing during apartheid) six months ago.\n\nMK said it would replace \"constitutional supremacy\" with \"parliamentary supremacy,\" expropriate land without compensation, and nationalize mines and banks.\n\nRemarkably, MK gained 14.6 percent of the national vote, including 45 percent in KwaZulu-Natal, where it would almost certainly form the government. MK also became the official opposition in Mpumalanga as the second-largest party, with 17 percent. The paradox is that the alleged architect of the corruption for which the ANC was punished won one-sixth of the national vote, making MK the country's third-largest party.\n\nSo, with which party would the ANC form a coalition?\n\nMany believe there are only three realistic choices. The first option is the white-dominated, business-friendly DA, which Ramaphosa seems to favor. However, many within the ANC would oppose this.\n\nThe DA's campaign slogan, \"Rescue South Africa,\" echoes \"White Man's burden\" tropes. The DA has also consistently criticized the ANC's social welfare programs benefiting impoverished black people. A coalition could also pose risks to the DA, as it did to the apartheid era's ruling National Party, which was swallowed up in an earlier coalition with the ANC.\n\nThe second plausible partner is the left-leaning, youth-supported Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which is often caricatured as a \"Marxist party\" of extremists, having called for uncompensated land redistribution, and the nationalization of mines and banks. The EFF has also consistently maintained an anti-xenophobic Pan-Africanism and raised issues of structural inequality that no other mainstream party has addressed.\n\nAn ANC-EFF alliance would be deeply opposed by the powerful white corporate sector and many white voters, with the DA describing it as a \"doomsday coalition.\" However, it is unlikely that the EFF tail would wag the ANC dog, which won four times as many votes.\n\nThe third option could be a return to the 1994 to 1996 government of national unity in which South Africa's largest parties share portfolios according to their electoral support. There is also speculation about Ramaphosa's future, with MK already conditioning an unlikely coalition deal on his removal. (South African Vice President Paul Mashatile and ANC Chair Gwede Mantashe were touted as likely successors.)\n\nA president must be chosen by parliament within 14 days, even as this election has raised two serious concerns. The first is that the pathologies of South Africa's unstable government coalitions at the local level would become a national problem, triggering political paralysis. Second, it is feared that Zuma's Zulu-led victory in his home province could lead South Africa to an atavistic ethnic politics that revives the violent clashes once stoked by the apartheid regime.\n\nWith the death of Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosutho Buthelezi last year, Zuma now towers over the country's second-largest province like a political colossus.\n\nThis election could be the last time that any party gains a majority in a South African national election, the astute South African pundit Steven Friedman said. Coalition politics could be here to stay.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There can no longer be a pretence that it alone represents \"the people\". It is now simply the largest among a host of ordinary political parties doing what ordinary political parties do: scrambling for votes, political power and influence.\n\nI have studied the ANC since the days of the liberation struggle and as a party in power.\n\nIn reality, any notion of the ANC embodying the people has been creaking for years. Those at odds with its leadership have peeled away to found new political parties. First there was Bantu Holomisa, who fell out with Nelson Mandela in 1996. More recently, in 2012, Julius Malema was expelled after supposedly bringing the ANC into disrepute. Malema founded the Economic Freedom Fighters to fight the election in 2014.\n\nOnly the Economic Freedom Fighters was to gain much political traction. But the message was clear: the coalition on which the ANC was based was becoming ever more fragile and could not last.\n\nHence the historical significance of the electoral eruption of the uMkhonto we Sizwe Party (MK Party) of Jacob Zuma, former president of both the ANC and South Africa. Prior to the 2024 election, Zuma's party was widely recognised as representing a threat to ANC hegemony, both nationally and provincially in KwaZulu-Natal. But the strength of its performance has taken South Africa (and the party itself) aback.\n\nWithin six months, and with only the rudiments of organisation stolen from the ANC itself, it has taken 14.5% of the national votes and 45% of the KwaZulu-Natal votes in its first election.\n\nFew can dispute that its rise is the most dramatic stage in the dissolution of the coalition which gave the ANC a claim to being a liberation movement.\n\nThe making of a liberation movement\n\nThe ANC's claim goes back to its foundation in 1912. It was a reaction to the formation of the Union of South Africa by white politicians and their exclusion of the majority black people from the right to vote or participate on equal terms with whites.\n\nAt its creation, the ANC (or the South African Native National Congress, as it was known until 1923) was the coming together of South Africa's black and Coloured population (in the old terminology): its diverse ethnic peoples, their chiefly representatives and the emerging African professionals and black middle class.\n\nThis culminated decades later in its leadership of the Congress Alliance, the bringing together of the ANC with the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress and the (largely white) Congress of Democrats.\n\nThe ANC's predominance among those fighting apartheid was to be briefly challenged by the breakaway of the Africanists grouped together as the Pan-Africanist Congress in 1959. But the threat dissipated during the long years of exile as the Pan-Africanist Congress collapsed into factionalism.\n\nBy the early 1990s, via its alliance with the South African Communist Party, and under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, the ANC could put forth a highly plausible claim to be the genuine representative of \"the people\". By this it meant the overwhelming majority of South Africans, of diverse colours and backgrounds, who were bound together by a commitment to \"non-racialism\" and who were oppressed by apartheid. This was confirmed by the ANC's performance in the 1994 election: 63% of the vote.\n\nIt could say that the non-racial and democratic South Africa which had emerged from the negotiation process with the apartheid regime was essentially the product of its own vision and imagination.\n\nIf any movement could lay claim to having \"liberated\" South Africa, it was the ANC. However, while aspiring to unity, the ANC was never a monolith. Indeed, it was precisely because it was always a coalescence of diverse tendencies, notably of communists and non-communists, and of \"Africanists\" and those committed to \"non-racialism\", that so much importance was attached to the notion of its being a \"liberation movement\".\n\nA political party was seen as just that: a grouping which represented just a \"part\" of the people. In contrast, the ANC was presented and viewed itself as embodying the essence of the people, the soul of the nation, and as capable of reconciling differences which might otherwise blow a historically and racially divided nation apart. It followed that those who opposed it were divisive.\n\nIn other words, there was always a tension at the heart of the ANC's notion of democracy. It was always a difficult balancing act. At one moment, it celebrated the diversity and plurality which found its form in a new constitution which was largely based on the tenets of liberal democracy. At another, it insisted on the unity of the nation under its own leadership, which was distinctly illiberal, even totalitarian.\n\nLiberal democracy presumed that the ANC's leadership of the nation could be displaced at an election. But the alternative notion of democracy suggested that it could not. If the ANC was \"the people\", how could \"the people\" overthrow the ANC?\n\nThe ANC has lost ground, but the tradition lives on\n\nAt its height, reached in the 2004 election, the ANC swept just under 69.7% of the total vote. With Holomisa's United Democratic Movement winning 2.3%, the total vote for parties representing the historical tradition of the ANC amounted to 71%.\n\nIn the 2013 election, the total vote for the ANC tradition, made up of the ANC (62.15%), Economic Freedom Fighters (6.35%) and United Democratic Movement (1%), amounted to 69.5%. In 2019, the combined vote for the ANC (57.5%) and Economic Freedom Fighters (10.8%) remained much the same, at 68.3%. So it remains in 2024, with the combined vote for the ANC (40.18%), Economic Freedom Fighters (9.52%) and uMkhonto we Sizwe (14.59%) coming in at 64.3%.\n\nIn short, the ANC tradition remains dominant, but the ANC as a liberation movement does not.\n\nHerein lies much of the significance of the 2024 election. It is the ANC that has lost ground, not the ANC tradition. What has become divided could reunite. Or more likely, bits of it could reunite.\n\nThe faultline\n\nA commitment to the form and values of the constitution is becoming the major fault-line in South Africa's politics, opening the potential for an alliance between uMkhonto we Sizwe, Economic Freedom Fighters and the remnants of the \"radical economic transformation\" faction within the ANC.\n\nThe more that looms, the greater the possibilities for a coming together of the constitutional element within the ANC, a progressive bloc within the main opposition Democratic Alliance, and other parties, the old (Inkatha Freedom Party) and the new, such as Rise Mzansi, which are committed to the values of 1994.\n\nNever has the future of South Africa's politics been more uncertain, but the one certainty that holds is that the ANC's standing as a liberation movement is dead. In effect, there are now two ANCs: the ANC of current leader Cyril Ramaphosa, and the ANC of Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema. They cannot both claim to represent \"the people\".", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Not according Mbeki, who is also former President Thabo Mbeki's brother.\n\n\"We have to realise, the ANC doesn't actually have to work with anyone as long as it can gets its president elected in Parliament. The opposition in Parliament are not united, so some of them will vote for an ANC candidate, others will abstain, others will vote with ANC.\n\n\"So, it doesn't follow that the ANC has to have a coalition. It can have a president elected without having to enter into a formal coalition with any of the parties. It's a big party and it sits with 40% of the vote. The nearest competitor is way down at 21% which is the DA,\" says Mbeki.\n\nALSO READ: Sisulu calls on black parties to unite to prevent ANC-DA coalition\n\nMbeki said there is \"excitement over nothing.\"\n\n\"The reality is that the ANC can get its president elected and then the president forms the cabinet.\"\n\nMbeki said there is a lot \"childishness\" among opposition parties who are vying for positions in a coalition government.\n\n\"The challenge is the future of the country. It's not the future of whom is the finance minister or who is the home affairs minister. It's the wellbeing of the people of South Africa. That's what the political parties, as far as I'm concerned should focus on, how do they advance the wellbeing of the people of South Africa.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Ebrahim Fakir told The Citizen the \"safest\" option is to go for a government of national unity.\n\n\"You have to hand out things proportionately to different parties. The thing is who do you bring in? MK is the third largest party. If you go with a government of national unity and you want to be absolutely principled, then its only fair that they get at least one portfolio, like it or not.\"\n\nFakir says the ANC-DA coalition is only good for society, but each political party will be thinking of their own interests.\n\n\"The ANC-DA coalition is good for the society, but it's not good for the either of the parties themselves because the ANC base will be like 'no', the animosity are so deep if you go in with these guys,' You got DA people who might do the same.\n\n\"Number two, the way these parties have interacted with each other before, who's to say they are not going to be the obstructionists or make demands on each other that are unrealistic, or undermine each other in power so that they can show each up come the next election,\" Fakir said.\n\nFakir said a coalition between the ANC and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) could also spell disaster.\n\n\"If you go ANC-EFF or ANC-MK route, what is the point? You are bringing together parties which have massive animosities and differences. They just broke up with each other. If you bring them together, they will be stable for another three years and then their interests will diverge and you'll have the same kind of cannibalisation going on.\"\n\nFakir said black parties had the opportunity to craft black agenda, but they were unable to achieve this for the past 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, ANC veteran Lindiwe Sisulu has called on black political parties to unite under a \"black pact flag\" to take the country forward.\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) member said a coalition between the ANC and Democratic Alliance (DA) would be spitting on the graves of fallen struggle heroes.\n\nSisulu said a coalition between the ANC and DA will be a betrayal of those who strictly voted for the ANC adding that it may not help with the \"healing process of this beautiful nation\".", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faizel_patel@citizen.co.za", "name": "Faizel Patel", "type": "author",

We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters.\n\nMbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nThe stakes are high for South Africa, which has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption.\n\nThe electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39.\n\n\"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nANC COALITION-BUILDING HAS NO EASY ANSWER\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nUnderlining that dynamic, a group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards with slogans such as \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC spokesperson said on Wednesday the party would not talk to any counterparts that demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining a governing alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Alexander Winning; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

He wrote, \"Rha!DA Sies,\" \"Don't Bed With Genocide Supporters,\" and \"Not in Our Name\".\n\nSpeaking to News24 on Wednesday, Hasane said the picket will take place at 08:00 on the same day that national executive committee members are scheduled to meet in Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg on Thursday. The ANC's national working committee met late on Tuesday for an update on the talks held so far.\n\nExplaining his stance, Hasane said: \"In most cases than not, what informs DA policy is an ideal world that they only live in, and that does not benefit the majority of South Africans.\n\n\"I know for a fact that when they are in government, they cannot scrap these policies that already exist, but they will make sure that they are undermined or underdeveloped, so any coalition that has the DA is going to embolden the racist white company owner in South Africa to resist employment equity, minimum wage and the protection of workers because they know that at a national level, they know that they have someone who has their racist back, basically.\"\n\nHasane believes the DA coalition \"is probably a last straw\" to any ANC member.\n\nHe said:\n\nNews24 reported that there is growing discontent within some structures, with some expressing that the DA was an extension of the National Party.\n\nBriefing the media on Wednesday afternoon, SACP general-secretary Solly Mapaila campaigned against the \"anti-worker, neo-liberal and corrupt state captured networks\".\n\n\"We will maintain the strategic consistency of the SACP, which is against seeking coalition agreements with the right-wing, anti-people, anti-worker, and neoliberal forces led by the DA on the one hand, and on the other hand, state capture forces that are characterised by gangster politics as well as criminality and mafia,\" said Mapaila.\n\nHasane, who started mobilising support on Monday, said the DA was a replacement of the National Party.\n\n\"This is definitely a betrayal [to those who voted for the ANC] because when you vote, you are not only voting for something, you are making a statement against something.\"\n\nHe said he agreed with former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, who has urged the ANC to not be driven by \"investor-friendly\" coalitions and that most South Africans vote for parties with similar policies.\n\nMadonsela took to X on 2 June expressing a view that: \"An approach primarily driven by investor friendliness is why the ANC is in this mess in addition to the corruption worsened by state capture which affected energy security and other service delivery issues. To the ANC, please do not let the investor-friendly narrative determine your choice.\"\n\nHasane added that, \"after the everything that the DA has done to undermine and weaken the ANC government and ensure that it is out of power, they cannot now reward them with working with them for successfully removing them. That is what is basically happening now\".\n\nHe charged:\n\nHasane said he refused to sit on social media platforms and watch the party he loves \"without expressing his disapproval\".\n\n\"If I have to decide later on whether I am staying or leading [sic] an ANC with the DA, then I would know that I said something. I did not only tweet about it.\"\n\nBecause the ANC has not made its decision on who it will co-govern with, Hasane said he will wait for an official announcement to be made. \"We just want them to know that while they are talking, we are not happy. If we have to approach people, we will approach them after they have made their decision\".\n\nIn a statement shared on X, the #NotWiththeDA movement said it will tell NEC members to \"ignore, reject, and resist attempts to influence\" them towards a DA coalition agreement.\n\nThe DA was rejected by 80% of voters in May 2024 due to their regressive stance on progressive policies aimed at advancing the rights of the majority and addressing past imbalances caused by colonialism and apartheid.\"\n\nA prominent communications consultant and social commentator, who asked to remain anonymous, urged ANC leaders to stop negotiating with the \"enemy\".\n\n\"They should rather spend their energy engaging progressive forces, who are interested in the liberation of the black majority.\"\n\nThe woman said she opposed the marriage primarily because \"the DA is a racist organisation that has no common elements with the ANC. We cannot be seen collaborating with the enemy. It goes against everything that I stand for as a person.\"\n\nShe said it was important for ANC members to express their displeasure on Thursday.\n\n\"It's important because we started to speak out before the election that they should distance themselves from these utterances that Helen Zille and John Steenhuisen have been making, talking about courting the ANC and such, and if such discussions had taken place before the elections, we were like: 'Well these people are making it very clear discussions are happening and therefore, you should distance yourselves from any notion of this and assure the public, ANC voters and members.' The people deserve to know what they are getting themselves into, with voting for the ANC,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "newzimbabwe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewZimbabwe.com"},

We're looking at all options,\" he told reporters.\n\nMbalula said President Cyril Ramaphosa would disclose what the NEC had decided in a closing address.\n\nThe stakes are high for South Africa, which has been struggling with sluggish economic growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, a persistent racial wealth divide, severe power shortages and political corruption.\n\nThe electoral maths has created a complex situation for the ANC, which will have 159 of the 400 seats in the new National Assembly.\n\nIts nearest rivals are the pro-business, white-led Democratic Alliance (DA), with 87 seats, the populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) led by former president Jacob Zuma, with 58, and the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 39.\n\n\"We have engaged with everybody and we are talking to even smaller parties. We want to bring everyone on board,\" said Mbalula.\n\nThe DA, for its part, signalled on Wednesday that it did not want to join a government that also included MK or the EFF.\n\nANC COALITION-BUILDING HAS NO EASY ANSWER\n\nAny deal with the DA would be welcomed by financial markets but unpopular with many ANC supporters who regard it as a champion of what some South Africans call \"white monopoly capital\".\n\nUnderlining that dynamic, a group of anti-DA protesters stood outside the hotel where the NEC meeting was taking place, holding placards with slogans such as \"The DA wants to destroy the ANC\" and \"Not in our names\".\n\nOn the other hand, a deal with the EFF or MK, which advocate nationalising mines and seizing land without compensation, would be more popular with some in the ANC base but rattle investors.\n\nBoth the EFF and MK are led by former ANC figures who broke away and are at odds with the current leadership. Zuma in particular openly loathes Ramaphosa, and his party said after the election that it would not work with \"the ANC of Ramaphosa\".\n\nThe ANC spokesperson said on Wednesday the party would not talk to any counterparts that demanded Ramaphosa's resignation as a condition of joining a governing alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Mbalula added: \"It's been very difficult to engage with MK. It depends after this meeting if we will still meet with them.\"\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals, and was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption.\n\nHe remains well liked in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police have been deployed this week to maintain public order. The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Alexander Winning; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

This has put it in a difficult position to form a government on its own.\n\n\"The ANC is driven by the imperative to maintain national unity, stability and to put in place a government that will move with speed to tackle all the pressing socio-economic challenges our nation faces,\" Bhengu-Motsiri said.\n\nShe said the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) will meet Thursday to discuss which parties could join them in forming the government of national unity. The party publicist also said the ANC will also discuss possibilities of having a minority government.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the former liberation movement has contacted all political parties regarding the possibility of working together.\n\nThe ANC, which had 230 members of parliament in the previous house (May 2019-May 2024), saw its support fall to 159 seats in the May 29 elections. There are 400 seats in South Africa's national parliament.\n\nThe official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) got 87 seats, while former President Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe party garnered 58 seats, pushing the Economic Freedom Fighters party led by Julius Malema to the number four position after getting 39 seats.

The province was the scene of deadly riots in 2021 when Zuma was sentenced.\n\n(Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Alexander Winning; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMkhonto_we_Sizwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UMkhonto we Sizwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee_of_the_African_National_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Executive Committee of the African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Monopoly_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Monopoly Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He has worked for several media brands both in Ghana and on the International scene.

The uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma has 58 seats, the EFF 39, the Inkatha Freedom Party, 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance (PA) nine.\n\nANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told journalists in Johannesburg that \"At this point in time the conversation is looking at the government of national unity because this is what the people of South Africa said to us.\"\n\nShe said, the party's National Executive Committee would discuss options on Thursday. But even before the ANC takes a decision, the second-largest party, DA has said it would not join a government that included some of its smaller rivals.\n\n\"If the (ANC's) idea is also to extend an invitation to all parties above a certain threshold to serve in the executive, which would include MK, the EFF and the PA, our negotiating team will not be empowered to conclude such an arrangement,\" DA spokesperson Werner Horn is quoted by Reuters as saying.\n\nThe ANC has run South Africa since Nelson Mandela led it to victory in the 1994 elections, marking the end of apartheid.\n\nBut it has lost its parliamentary majority and faces a tough time securing coalition partners to form a government.\n\nMs Bhengu-Motsiri is optimistic despite the prevailing difficulties getting parties from across South Africa's political spectrum to agree on common policies.\n\n\"We believe that despite any differences we may have, working together as South Africans, we can seize this moment to usher our country into a new era of hope,\" she said.\n\nThe ANC though has to find a solution in the coming days as parliament must sit and elect a president within 14 days of the results being declared.",

The partnership would see the DA take up strategic positions in government and in the legislatures.\n\nThe governing party, the ANC, scored 40.18% at the polls, the lowest results in 30 years of democracy.\n\nThe DA achieved 21.80%, while former president Jacob Zuma's newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MKP) scored 17.4%. Since the ANC did not meet the 50% threshold required for an outright majority, it would need a coalition partner in order to govern.\n\nSpeaking to Independent Media, on Monday, Sisulu said a coalition with the DA would be catastrophic for all the efforts made to transform the country.\n\n\"Firstly this looming disaster, if the ANC would ever partner with the DA, could've been avoided has the IEC (Electoral Commission of SA) done its work properly. I was instrumental in setting up the IEC because I was deputy minister of Home Affairs at the time when Buthelezi was minister of Home Affairs. I ended up signing a lot of the legislation which saw the IEC did its work properly.\n\n\"I would think that after 30 years the commission would be able to run a fair and transparent election. Since 26 parties complained about the counting and the results, the IEC for its own credibility should've issued a recount. That has brought us to this.\n\n\"In all the time I spent in prison fighting apartheid, I did not do it for the DA. The DA is the epitome of what the previous government represents. The idea that black parties cannot govern is very racist. It is an insult for people who oppressed us and who threw us in jail for fighting for justice to tell that we can't govern.\n\n\"The president of the ANC cannot enter a coalition with any party without the NEC's approval. He is president of the country because of the ANC voters. He will not throw those votes away. I hear the discussions in the media and in some quarters of society saying that it will be good for the country and good for capital if the ANC went into bed with the DA, well those the talks of capital. I know that the president has friends in capital, but capital doesn't decide internal ANC matters. If it does then perhaps I'm in the wrong party\" Sisulu said.\n\nAsked if she supports an ANC-MK coalition, Sisulu said she doesn't blame many of the soldiers that she trained with in the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) camp who later left the ANC.\n\n\"I was trained in MK. When we were in the camps I used to imagine that one day we'd come home dressed in our uniform and land at the airport to the salute of our people. But when we landed, the MK soldiers were starved.

ANC is considering forming a government of national unity with other parties to maintain control and ensure Ramaphosa's reelection.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa engaged in high-stakes discussions with senior African National Congress (ANC) officials on Thursday to navigate a political deadlock that emerged after the party lost its 30-year majority.\n\nThe ANC's National Executive Committee convened in Johannesburg to address internal divisions regarding the future direction of the party. Despite losing its long-held majority, the ANC remains the largest party and is exploring options, including forming a government of national unity, to govern the country.\n\nAccording to ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula, the proposal for a government of national unity aims to incorporate multiple political parties rather than forming a direct coalition with the Democratic Alliance (DA). However, debate and disagreement are anticipated.\n\nHistorically significant for leading South Africa out of apartheid under Nelson Mandela, the ANC has faced dwindling support over the last two decades amid pervasive poverty, unemployment, and inequality.\n\nThe decision-making body of over 80 top officials is tasked with charting the ANC's path forward, yet the idea of a unity government faces skepticism from other parties. The political leaders must reach a resolution before the newly elected Parliament convenes on June 16, with one of its initial tasks being the election of a president.\n\nRamaphosa's bid for a second term is intertwined with the agreement process, since the ANC lacks a parliamentary majority. A potential coalition with the centrist DA -- which holds the second largest vote share -- could secure a majority but faces resistance from both ANC grassroots and political allies.\n\nMoreover, the DA opposes broad agreements with many political parties, notably refusing to cooperate with Jacob Zuma's MK Party and the Economic Freedom Fighters, which won third and fourth in the elections.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee_of_the_African_National_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Executive Committee of the African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/31_05_2024_21_14_04_8530637.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 1607, "textEnd": 1614}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

ANC lost its long-held majority in last week's vote but remained the biggest party, and now needs some form of agreement with others to run Africa's most industrialized country.\n\nANC has indicated it's leaning toward a government of national unity that would bring together many of the political parties in a broad agreement, rather than a direct coalition with the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance, or DA.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board,\" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said before Thursday's meeting, which was likely to last all day. Mbalula said a government of national unity was being proposed to the NEC to decide on, but he expected there to be debate and disagreement.\n\nANC is the party that was once led by Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule by winning the country's historic first all-race vote in 1994. It had seen a gradual decline in its support over the last 20 years as South Africa struggles with high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality.\n\nThe National Executive Committee that includes more than 80 of the ANC's top officials is expected to be the body to decide on which direction it will take.\n\nThere's no guarantee that all the other parties will accept the idea of a government of national unity, even as South Africa's political leaders are under some time pressure to decide on the way forward as the newly elected Parliament must sit for the first time by June 16, with one of its first priorities to elect a president.\n\nThe South African president is seeking a second term in office, and the agreement being sought will also decide if Ramaphosa is reelected. South African elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers then elect the president. Because ANC only won 40% of the vote and lost its parliamentary majority for the first time, it needs others to join with it to reelect Ramaphosa for his final term.\n\nA coalition between ANC and the centrist DA had been touted as the likeliest option to co-govern South Africa as the two would hold a clear majority after DA won the second biggest share of the vote with 21%.\n\nBut that has met resistance from grassroots ANC structures as well as some of its political allies, like South Africa's congress of trade unions.\n\nDA could also be opposed to a wide-ranging agreement involving many political parties given it has insisted it will never work with two of them -- the new populist MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. They won the third and fourth biggest shares of the vote.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

national consensus on the form of government best suited to move South Africa forward.\n\nIt would \"engage all parties and unite the broadest range of sectors of our population behind the urgent need to move our country out of the current potential electoral stalemate\".\n\nThe party wanted to maintain stability and national unity to put in place a government that would \"move at speed\" to address South Africa's pressing socio-economic problems.\n\n\"We believe that despite any differences we may have, working together as South Africans, we can seize this moment to usher our country into a new era of hope,\" she said.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said the ANC \"remains committed to ensure that we build a national consensus to avoid any uncertainty that can lead to instability\".\n\nThe party would not abandon its principles or its commitment to transformation and would work with partners who embraced constitutionalism.\n\nShe said the NEC would \"come with a clear determination\" and would talk to its members, its alliance partners, civil society and the country \"on our view about the immediate next steps and the future\".\n\nThe party will unveil its premier candidates for provinces where it holds an outright majority -- or where it is likely to head a coalition -- next week, ahead of the sitting of the provincial legislatures on 17 and 18 June.\n\nBhengu-Motsiri said

The populist uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), led by former president Jacob Zuma, will have 58 seats, the EFF 39, the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party 17 and the far-right Patriotic Alliance nine.\n\nThe business sector and investors have a strong preference for the ANC doing a deal with the DA, which is strongly pro-business and advocates scrapping some of the ANC's Black empowerment policies on the basis that they haven't worked.\n\nThe EFF's proposals, which include nationalising mines and banks and redistributing land from white to Black farmers, mean that it is viewed far less positively by markets and the private sector.\n\nThe rand currency ZAR=D3 extended losses in volatile trade as Bhengu-Motsiri spoke, trading down more than 1 percent against the dollar at one stage.\n\nShe said the ANC had approached Zuma's MK party, which came a surprisingly strong third in the election, but had been rebuffed.\n\n\"Our door remains open,\" she said.\n\nZuma was forced to quit as president in 2018 following a series of corruption scandals and was later jailed for contempt of court after refusing to participate in an inquiry into corruption. He is now an implacable enemy of Ramaphosa.\n\nZuma remains popular in his home province, populous KwaZulu-Natal, where extra police were being deployed to maintain public order, according to a

Humbled by a stinging election result, South Africa's African National Congress was talking to everyone in an effort to form a stable coalition government for Africa's most advanced economy after it lost its 30-year majority.\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was meeting with senior officials of the African National Congress on Thursday to decide how to go about forming a government after the party lost its 30-year grip on power and left a post-election deadlock.\n\nThe party's National Executive Committee was meeting in Johannesburg to work through a split within the party's ranks over which direction to take. ANC lost its long-held majority in last week's vote but remained the biggest party, and now needs some form of agreement with others to run Africa's most industrialized country.\n\nANC has indicated it's leaning toward a government of national unity that would bring together many of the political parties in a broad agreement, rather than a direct coalition with the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance, or DA.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board,\" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said before Thursday's meeting, which was likely to last all day. Mbalula said a government of national unity was being proposed to the NEC to decide on, but he expected there to be debate and disagreement.\n\nANC is the party that was once led by Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule by winning the country's historic first all-race vote in 1994. It had seen a gradual decline in its support over the last 20 years as South Africa struggles with high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality.\n\nThe National Executive Committee that includes more than 80 of the ANC's top officials is expected to be the body to decide on which direction it will take.\n\nThere's no guarantee that all the other parties will accept the idea of a government of national unity, even as South Africa's political leaders are under some time pressure to decide on the way forward as the newly elected Parliament must sit for the first time by June 16, with one of its first priorities to elect a president.\n\nThe South African president is seeking a second term in office, and the agreement being sought will also decide if Ramaphosa is reelected. South African elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers then elect the president. Because ANC only won 40% of the vote and lost its parliamentary majority for the first time, it needs others to join with it to reelect Ramaphosa for his final term.\n\nA coalition between ANC and the centrist DA had been touted as the likeliest option to co-govern South Africa as the two would hold a clear majority after DA won the second biggest share of the vote with 21%.\n\nBut that has met resistance from grassroots ANC structures as well as some of its political allies, like South Africa's congress of trade unions.\n\nDA could also be opposed to a wide-ranging agreement involving many political parties given it has insisted it will never work with two of them -- the new populist MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. They won the third and fourth biggest shares of the vote.\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors":

Cosatu, which is usually opposed to any dealings with the DA and would favour a leftist alliance, is trying to be pragmatic given its concerns about other potential partners and the damage they could cause to both the ANC and the economy, they added.\n\nREAD: Who will govern SA? Here's why the markets favour an ANC/DA coalition\n\nThe federation has been a close ANC ally since it took power three decades ago and plays a key role in its campaigning. Union leaders do have some influence on the ANC's thinking, but the party's leadership will ultimately determine its next move. The ANC's national executive committee (NEC) is meeting on Thursday to decide on a way forward.\n\nCosatu's leadership has yet to pronounce its official position on the talks, and its openness to some sort of arrangement with the DA comes as a surprise because it has accused the party of representing the interests of the white minority and big business. The DA has consistently voted against legislation to protect workers and named a six-person team to negotiate the composition of the next administration, four of whom are white.\n\nREAD: Zuma unreachable for coalition talks, says Mbalula, as ANC members protest potential DA alliance\n\nAny tie-up will be a tough sell to Cosatu's affiliates and their 1.8 million members. Cosatu's secretary-general Solly Phetoe told the SABC on Thursday that the ANC should avoid a coalition with the DA because of its stance on labor rights.\n\nEFF leaders have been caught up in corruption scandals, attacked President Cyril Ramaphosa in parliament and threatened to destroy the ANC, giving union leaders cause for concern, the person said.\n\nThere is no appetite among the ANC or its union allies to work with the breakaway MKP, which cost it a substantial number of votes and is primarily responsible for the current predicament it finds itself in, they said. There are also concerns about the integrity of the party's leaders, they added.\n\nThe ANC, which led the fight against apartheid before taking power under Nelson Mandela in 1994, has said that it favours the formation of a government of national unity that would include all of its main rivals, but it faces an uphill battle in getting them to participate.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen has said he's open to a deal, but won't work with either the EFF or MKP, while Zuma's party has said it will only cooperate with the ANC if Ramaphosa is replaced -- a demand that's been flatly rejected. On Wednesday, the ANC said its approaches to the MKP had been ignored.\n\nThere are wide-ranging views within the ANC about the preferred makeup of the next administration, and the party is likely to be divided no matter who is included, with talks expected to drag on, the person said. There are also divisions among DA negotiators over how a tie-up should work, with some favouring a government of nation unity and others a less formal working arrangement, they said.\n\nWhile there are some DA officials that Cosatu can work with, the party's oppositional stance toward Black Economic Empowerment is problematic, especially since so many of its top leaders are white, the person said.\n\nThe DA's antipathy toward the government's plans to implement universal national health insurance is also an issue since most people don't have medical insurance and many of those who do consider it to be unaffordable and want workable alternatives to be made available, they said.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This comes after he allegedly received R1.6 million in bribes. It is alleged that he benefitted from luxury accommodation, loans, and other gratuities from EOH while the company was bidding for government tenders.\n\nSpeaking on VOC's PM Drive show on Wednesday, an independent political analyst, professor Zwelethu Jolobe, said the matter is not surprising.\n\n\"Firstly, President Cyril Ramaphosa's presidency has come with this idea of reform and renewal, and there has been a concerted effort to hold high-profile people accountable,\" remarked Jolobe.\n\n\"Secondly, coalitions will not be as dramatic as people make it out to be - even though one party did not win over 50% - you still have one party with 40% which is enough chunk of the vote that will prevent the chaos you see in other coalition,\" explained Jolobe.\n\nWhere things get interesting, said Jolobe, is who does the ANC call onto to make up for that 10% deficit?\n\n\"Either they go uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party, and MK is saying no to them, and this leaves the African National Congress (ANC) with one other option, being the Democratic Alliance (DA),\" said Jolobe.\n\nHe further stressed that some form of coalition will take place, and the only way that coalition can be successful is if you have the ANC in it. According to Jolobe, there is no way you can have other parties in the coalition without the ANC.\n\n\"In theory, it is plausible that the ANC can go into opposition but it is the least desirable scenario. Also, the only other stable option the ANC got for a party that has a 40% margin is the DA because it emerges as the second largest party,\" clarified Jolobe.\n\nThis is in light of the fact that the MK party has no interest in the ANC, said Jolobe, in trying to assist in forming a government. However, the only way to make such an arrangement legitimate, explained Jolobe, is to invite other parties and call it a \"government of national unity.\"", "source": {"uri": "vocfm.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Voice of the Cape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aneeqa_du_plessis@vocfm.co.za", "name": "Aneeqa Du Plessis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizi_Kodwa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizi Kodwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMkhonto_we_Sizwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UMkhonto we Sizwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dutch East India Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.vocfm.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WhatsApp-Image-2024-06-06-at-3.02.58-PM.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It is now in a strong position to influence coalition negotiations.\n\nAs the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) is set to meet on Thursday to discuss the way forward in their coalition talks, Mbalula said contacting the MK party had been \"very difficult\".\n\n\"It is very difficult to talk to people there, because when you talk to them, they say they are still waiting for Baba [Zuma] and that Baba can't be found.\"\n\nAn ANC insider told TimesLIVE that Mbalula's office had reached out to MK party leader Jacob Zuma at least twice this week with no response.\n\n\"When you reach out, some open the door and others don't. It is normal,\" the source said.\n\nALSO READ: Choices for ANC: Top choice would be a government of national unity\n\nSpeaking outside the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg on Thursday, Mbalula said the ANC was still undecided on whether to continue to engage with the MK party.\n\n\"We have tried to reach out and we drew blanks. It depends on this [NEC] meeting whether we will still meet with them.

Cosatu, which is usually opposed to any dealings with the DA and would favor a leftist alliance, is trying to be pragmatic given its concerns about other potential partners and the damage they could cause to both the ANC and the economy, they added.\n\nThe federation has been a close ANC ally since it took power three decades ago and plays a key role in its campaigning. Union leaders do have some influence on the ANC's thinking, but the party's leadership will ultimately determine its next move. The ANC's national executive committee is meeting Thursday to decide on a way forward.\n\nThe ANC won just 40.2% of votes cast on May 29, meaning it will have to partner with at least one of its three biggest rivals to extend its 30-year rule: the DA, the leftist Economic Freedom Fighters or former President Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe Party, known as MKP.\n\nCosatu's leadership has yet to pronounce on its official position on the talks, and its openness to some sort of arrangement with the DA comes as a surprise because it has accused the party of representing the interests of the White minority and big business. The DA has consistently voted against legislation to protect workers and named a six-person team to negotiate the composition of the next administration, four of whom are White.\n\nAny tie-up will be a tough sell to Cosatu's affiliates and their 1.8 million members. Cosatu's Secretary-General Solly Phetoe told the South African Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday that the ANC should avoid a coalition with the DA because of its stance on labor rights.\n\nEFF leaders have been caught up in corruption scandals, attacked President Cyril Ramaphosa in parliament and threatened to destroy the ANC, giving union leaders cause for concern, the person said.\n\nThere is no appetite among the ANC or its union allies to work with the breakaway MKP, which cost it a substantial number of votes and is primarily responsible for the current predicament it find itself in, they said. There are also concerns about the integrity of the party's leaders, they added.\n\nBloomberg Terminal clients can click on ELEC ZA for more on South Africa's elections\n\nThe ANC, which led the fight against apartheid before taking power under Nelson Mandela in 1994, has said that it favors the formation of a government of national unity that would include all of its main rivals, but it faces an uphill battle in getting them to participate.\n\nDA leader John Steenhuisen has said he's open to a deal, but won't work with either the EFF or MKP, while Zuma's party has said it will only cooperate with the ANC if Ramaphosa is replaced -- a demand that's been flatly rejected. On Wednesday, the ANC said its approaches to the MKP had been ignored.\n\nThere are wide-ranging views within the ANC about the preferred makeup of the next administration, and the party is likely to be divided no matter who is included, with talks expected to drag on, the person said. There are also divisions among DA negotiators over how a tie-up should work, with some favoring a government of nation unity and others a less formal working arrangement, they said.\n\nWhile there are some DA officials that Cosatu can work with, the party's oppositional stance toward Black economic empowerment is problematic, especially since so many of its top leaders are White, the person said.\n\nThe DA's antipathy toward the government's plans to implement universal national health insurance is also an issue, since most people don't have medical insurance and many of those who do consider it to be unaffordable and want workable alternatives to be made available, they said.\n\nSign up here for the twice-weekly Next Africa newsletter.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca",

ANC lost its long-held majority in last week's vote but remained the biggest party, and now needs some form of agreement with others to run Africa's most industrialized country.\n\nANC has indicated it's leaning toward a government of national unity that would bring together many of the political parties in a broad agreement, rather than a direct coalition with the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance, or DA.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody on board,\" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said before Thursday's meeting, which was likely to last all day. Mbalula said a government of national unity was being proposed to the NEC to decide on, but he expected there to be debate and disagreement.\n\nANC is the party that was once led by Nelson Mandela and freed South Africa from the apartheid system of white minority rule by winning the country's historic first all-race vote in 1994. It had seen a gradual decline in its support over the last 20 years as South Africa struggles with high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality.\n\nThe National Executive Committee that includes more than 80 of the ANC's top officials is expected to be the body to decide on which direction it will take.\n\nSouth African pr\u00e9sident Cyril Ramaphosa waves as he arrives to meet with senior officials of his African National Congress party during the ANC's National Executive Committee Thursday, June 6, 2024 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay)\n\nThere's no guarantee that all the other parties will accept the idea of a government of national unity, even as South Africa's political leaders are under some time pressure to decide on the way forward as the newly elected Parliament must sit for the first time by June 16, with one of its first priorities to elect a president.\n\nThe South African president is seeking a second term in office, and the agreement being sought will also decide if Ramaphosa is reelected. South African elections decide how many seats each party gets in Parliament and lawmakers then elect the president. Because ANC only won 40% of the vote and lost its parliamentary majority for the first time, it needs others to join with it to reelect Ramaphosa for his final term.\n\nA coalition between ANC and the centrist DA had been touted as the likeliest option to co-govern South Africa as the two would hold a clear majority after DA won the second biggest share of the vote with 21%.\n\nBut that has met resistance from grassroots ANC structures as well as some of its political allies, like South Africa's congress of trade unions.\n\nDA could also be opposed to a wide-ranging agreement involving many political parties given it has insisted it will never work with two of them - the new populist MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. They won the third and fourth biggest shares of the vote.\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa\n\nSouth African pr\u00e9sident Cyril Ramaphosa, center, meets with senior officials of his African National Congress party during the ANC's National Executive Committee Thursday, June 6, 2024 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

I told you so.\n\nThe PA (now the sixth largest party in SA) wants to deliver on its single-item platform to screw illegal immigrants, the ones who look like them.\n\nThe EFF's voting numbers dropped (9.5%, 39 seats) but not far enough to make it a non-contender as the single party to take the ANC over 50% to constitute a coalition government.\n\nIn exchange, it wants control over the country's money and then to control that pesky speaker who keeps throwing dishonourable members out of parliament.\n\nQuestion: why is no-one demanding the education portfolio?\n\nOf course, there's nothing to raid there besides NSFAS and that damage has already been done; the cupboard is bare. In fact, some provincial governments are earnestly into \"budget cuts.\"\n\nThis is a good time to revisit my friend Justice Malala's book, or at least read the title: We are about to begin our descent.\n\nThe metaphor works because the turbulence on this aeroplane is going to be rough.\n\nLike recent Boeing aircraft (the 737 Max 9), there will be more than a few screws loose on our political aircraft.\n\nExpect very strange and unexpected things to happen, or as political pundits like to put it, we are in unchartered waters (shift of metaphors).\n\nBut let's first take in this moment.\n\nSouth Africans (if only 58.57% of eligible voters) made it clear that they have had enough of the ANC.\n\nWhy is this significant? Because in postcolonial Africa, the liberation party decides whether it has had enough of you, the voting fodder, not the other way round.\n\nLook no further than Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF, which credibly lost elections to the opposition and responded with extreme violence against opponents and their followers.\n\nSA has thankfully not gone down that road, bucking an African trend.\n\nWe have a strong democracy and robust institutions and for these we should be grateful.\n\nWhen President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers his resignation to the party, we would have witnessed a smooth transition of power.\n\nI wonder if Donald Trump's US is watching.\n\nFour things are clear from the elections. Our future is coalitions.\n\nThe ANC will never again win a clear majority for the liberation dividend has within a mere three decades, run its course.\n\nThe DA will never win outside the Western Cape.\n\nAnd minority parties will be the kingmakers of the future.\n\nBut who will go into coalition with whom? It is hard to say.\n\nThe middle classes and the business community are pushing for a DA/ANC coalition. This will stabilise the rand, they say, and encourage investment.\n\nIf the question is, what is in the best interests of the country, this is probably a sensible option.\n\nSuch a choice will require that the ANC overlooks the less-than-subtle politics of whiteness on which the DA survives.\n\nThe working classes want a coalition of black parties such as the ANC/EFF/MK.\n\nIf the question is, what do the masses want, then this is the more appropriate option.\n\nThis choice will require the ANC to hold its nose and pretend not to spell the added stench of corruption that the smaller parties (and itself) are so committed to.\n\nThere is of course an intersecting point in a Venn-diagram, a space in which these two interests overlap: the economic interests of the middle classes and the social interests of the working classes.\n\nHere the obvious coalition would be the ANC/DA/IFP. Reminds one of the first GNU, not so?\n\nTough choices lie ahead but coalition politics by definition mean that you do not get everything you want, yet at the same time you now have a seat at the table when it comes to national government.\n\nI think that is what the people want: not the lousy spectacle of parties routinely shouting at and insulting each other, but one in which MPs work together to get this country back on track.\n\nHow about a Government of National Get-Things-Done?\n\nIn that case, with an ANC/DA/IFP coalition, give finance and foreign affairs to the ANC, education and health to the DA, and home affairs and land reform to the IFP.\n\nUnder astute leadership from the president, here is a built-in checks and balances operation that represents the will of the people.\n\nFor what came out loud and clear from the elections is that no-one has a mandate to go it alone and that the will of the people is co-governance and not the domination of one party.",

We are now moving to a stage having received a mandate from the NEC to hard negotiations, and then where we look at the options, including the technicalities, because the government of national unity we talk about might be different from 1994. The devil is in the detail.\n\n\"The technical team in terms of negotiating and all of that will receive a broad mandate,\" Mbalula said.\n\nHe said the expectation was that the debate would be \"sober\", while also taking into consideration the experience of other countries that have been in a similar situation.\n\nMbalula said:\n\nHe added that they were concerned that some in the ANC had voiced their dissent outside party platforms and channels, referring to ANC members who staged a picket outside Birchwood Hotel.\n\nThe members are opposed to the ANC including the DA in any coalition governance agreement.\n\nKay Sexwale, who was among those protesting, said they were against any form of coalition or government of national unity that includes the DA.\n\nShe said:\n\nBut Mbalula said the protest was unfortunate and driven by disinformation.\n\n\"There has not been any position, and the position will be derived from this meeting, which is the NEC, the highest decision-making body of the ANC, and the president will pronounce on at the end,\" Mbalula said.\n\nLIVE | ActionSA exits Multi-Party Charter, will not work with ANC\n\nNews24 understands that consideration is still being given to a minority government formed with a \"confidence and supply\" arrangement with the DA.\n\nThis would ensure that the ANC has support in crucial parliamentary votes, including motions of confidence and budget votes. In exchange, the DA would potentially receive the position of deputy speaker of the National Assembly and the chairpersons of certain portfolio committees.\n\nA government of national unity would see all major parties being invited to participate, similar to what happened under former president Nelson Mandela from April 1994 to February 1997.\n\nMbalula, however, said they were careful not to back themselves into a corner.\n\n\"We are looking at models. It is not a case of the highway or a small path. The question is what you have achieved, what is before us, and what model is good for South Africans. When that model is agreed upon, will others, even beyond the ANC, agree to it? That is what is important.\n\n\"We have got scenarios, and from those scenarios we have got options, and we have narrowed those down to a government of national unity, where we invite everybody. We have not confined ourselves to an identity of a party,\" he said, adding that negotiations were also informed by a willingness to compromise.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siyamtanda_capa@news24.com", "name": "Siyamtanda Capa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boksburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boksburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boksburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ActionSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News24_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News24 (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_and_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence and supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global_Governance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global Governance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/11788/237965811dcf45718905e3d787204eb4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1994-04-", "dateEnd": "1997-02-", "textStart": 2467, "textEnd": 2494}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

And its focus on pro-growth policies and effective governance offers the ANC a way back to the voters' hearts by improving their material circumstances - a benefit that the dirigiste, anti-market policies of the EFF conspicuously do not.\n\nFor both these reasons, the ANC will be giving the DA option serious consideration when its senior leaders meet to discuss the way forward.

The National Executive Committee (NEC) member says a coalition between the ANC and Democratic Alliance (DA) would be spitting on the graves of fallen struggle heroes.\n\nSisulu was speaking to The Citizen about the possibility of the ANC going into a coalition with the DA.\n\nThe once dominant ANC lost 17% of its 2019 vote share in this year's national and provincial elections. It will now need to make a deal with other parties to form a coalition government for the first time in 30 years.\n\nSisulu said political parties like the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), among others, should unite.\n\n\"We come from the same stock. We don't have the same policies, necessarily, but those are our people. We fought all our lives to make sure that black people can take their place alongside any other race in this country because this is our country.\n\nALSO READ: ANC says NEC not divided over coalition talks after losing majority\n\n\"So we're going to look at the merits and of course I'm not a deciding factor, I'm just indicating my own views of it. These are people with a common history with us, a common struggle with us. These are people who are not only our offspring, but they share the ghettos with us. I don't know how many years afterwards, we're still in the ghetto. Why don't we try another strategy and say black people, we only have our shackles to lose,\" said Sisulu.\n\nSisulu said a coalition between the ANC and DA will be a betrayal of those who strictly voted for the ANC.\n\n\"[The DA] got rid of all the black leaders - what does it tell you? It is a ghetto subliminal racism. I have talked to each one of the leaders of the DA who has been removed. What pushes them out? I don't think the latent racism within the DA is about to die. Why would we go to bed with people who actually have a particular perception of black people?\n\n\"They have not changed. We have changed, we went into a coalition with those people who persecuted us because we had to go through a mental change of what's in the best interest of our people. We accepted and respected all the parties. The DA has not changed its DNA. You tell me how many black people (leaders) there are within the DA,\" Sisulu said.\n\nSisulu said \"a marriage between the ANC and DA may not help with the healing process of this beautiful nation\".\n\n\"Allowing the DA to co-govern could bring about a mini-apartheid as we can see how the lives of black people are in the Western Cape where the DA governs. Personally, I didn't go to jail and exile for the DA. As a family we lost approximately 56 years in prison combined as political prisoners under the white man's rule for only asking for justice and equality,\" Sisulu said.\n\nSisulu said ANC supporters should be asking themselves why would the ANC even consider a union with the DA and not \"our natural allies and brothers and sisters in a form of black pact of progressive forces?\"\n\n\"After all the struggle for our liberation was mainly to disentangle black people from colonialism and apartheid chains. So why are we donating ourselves, including our inherent rich and painful history to our oppressors?\n\n\"I am personally begging you to unite under one black pact flag to continue with the efforts of black liberation and economic emancipation... I beg you to unite on the following points as black progressive parties,\" Sisulu said.\n\nSisulu said she would even help facilitate the meeting of progressive black parties and negotiate to see if they can agree on issues, including an anti-corruption charter to promote clean governance, Africanisation of the law, restoration of state-owned entities (SOE) and a clear position in support for the people of Palestine.\n\nThe Citizen did contact the DA for comment.

Mbalula added that Ramaphosa will likely provide feedback on developments at the NEC meeting at around 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.\n\nThe ANC faces an uphill battle in getting its rivals to work together. DA leader John Steenhuisen on Tuesday ruled out working with either the EFF or MKP, which both favor nationalizing mines and banks, while Zuma's party has said it will only work with the ANC if Ramaphosa is replaced -- a condition the ANC has said is unacceptable.\n\nANC members staged a small protest outside the venue where the NEC is meeting, carrying posters urging the party's leadership not to partner with the DA in a government of national unity.\n\nYou can follow Bloomberg's reporting on Africa on WhatsApp. Sign up here.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Communist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungarian Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Party (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiations_to_end_apartheid_in_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkatha_Freedom_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inkatha Freedom Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steenhuisen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Steenhuisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 1002, "textEnd": 1008}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

For the first time since the end of apartheid, the ANC has failed to secure a majority, falling short of the crucial 50 percent threshold required to govern alone. This historic shift has opened the door to a new and uncertain era in South African politics, where coalitions between adversaries may become the norm rather than the exception.\n\nThe ANC's decline is not sudden. It's the culmination of years of dwindling support, driven by corruption scandals, internal factionalism and an inability to address the country's pressing socio-economic challenges.\n\nWhile the party still commands significant loyalty, especially in rural areas such as Limpopo, North West and the Eastern Cape, urban voters and the youth have shown increasing disillusionment with the ruling party. The electorate's message is clear: the status quo has to undergo a radical shift. The Democratic Alliance (DA), Umkhonto WeSizwe Party (MKP), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and other smaller parties now hold significant bargaining power. The very idea of these parties, particularly the DA, MK Party and EFF, collaborating with the ANC seems improbable given their stark ideological differences and contentious history.\n\nYet, in politics, necessity often breeds strange bedfellows.\n\nThe ANC must now navigate a political landscape where compromise and negotiation are essential. The most straightforward path to a coalition would be with the DA, South Africa's second-largest party, which represents a more liberal, laissez faire approach. However, ideological gaps between the ANC's leftist policies and the DA's center-right platform could prove difficult to bridge. The DA has long criticised the ANC's governance and tolerance of corruption, which may complicate trust-building and policy alignment.\n\nThe possibility of a coalition between the ANC and former President Jacob Zuma's MK Party would mark an intriguing yet complex development in South African politics, particularly given that the ANC has an on-going disciplinary process against Zuma based on his formation of the party.\n\nThe MK Party, steeped in militant rhetoric and radical economic policies, presents a stark contrast to the ANC's more moderate and historically mainstream approach. On the other hand, the EFF, led by Julius Malema, represents a more radical leftist faction, advocating for extensive land reforms and the nationalising of key industries - policies that resonate with a disenfranchised segment of the population but are anathema to both the ANC's moderate wing and the DA.\n\nA coalition with the EFF might force the ANC to adopt more radical policies, risking further alienation of moderate and business-friendly supporters. Regardless of which coalition path the ANC pursues, the implications for governance are profound.\n\nA coalition government, by its very nature, requires consensus-building and a willingness to prioritise national interests over party ideologies. This could foster a more inclusive and accountable governance model, breaking away from the single-party dominance that has characterised South African politics for decades.", "source": {"uri":

This move follows ANC's loss of its 30-year majority, with Ramaphosa seeking re-election through a coalition. The scenario resembles the post-apartheid unity government initiated by Nelson Mandela.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa and senior officials of the African National Congress (ANC) are deliberating on a unity government to address the country's political stalemate. The meeting, held Thursday, aims to finalize a proposal before the June 16 deadline.\n\nThis unity government initiative is reminiscent of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy in 1994 when Nelson Mandela's administration included political opponents for national reconciliation. However, the current situation is driven by necessity after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority in last week's election. The ANC secured only 40% of the vote but remains the largest party.\n\nANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula stated the party's intent to include all major parties to foster national unity. With more than 50 parties competing, including the Democratic Alliance and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters, forging a consensus will be challenging. The ANC must decide soon as the new Parliament is set to elect a president by June 16, with Ramaphosa aiming for a second term.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_06_2024_17_49_25_7403914.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 121, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The parties' top bras met at the Birchwood Hotel on the East Rand to discuss various options of possible coalition arrangement after the ANC failed to secure enough votes to constitute a government on its own.\n\nSeveral parties including the DA, the EFF, the IFP and the PA were touted as possible coalition partners.\n\nANC President Ramaphosa to announce decisions from the coalition talks meeting: Mzwandile Mbenje\n\nANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula says the Government of Unity would be different from the one formed in 1994.\n\n\"The devil is in the details and so, the technical team in terms of negotiating will receive a braid mandate. But here, we are expecting a sober discussion based on all the experiences of other countries in the world that have been in a situation like ours,\" he said.\n\n\"Never had we envisaged at a national level that we would be talking about coalitions. So, proposals put here are not cast in stone. Members of the NEC here are not robots, they will allow themselves to be engaged.\"\n\nHe also sketched the nature of their debates.\n\n\"We started with the officials meeting where we mapped the Strategic Framework to the ANC.

The question of the Strategic Framework is going to look into the outcome of the elections, as we all know that, it doesn't favour the ANC.

It is the nature of the beast.\n\nPost elections though, we expect better. It is especially so if, as it turns out, the South African electorate send the message that they want political parties to cooperate in forming a government that would lead the country for the next five years.\n\nUnfortunately, some parties think the electorate's mandate is to decide who should be in the ANC's leadership structures and in government. They wrongly believe that the electoral outcomes give them the right to decide which ANC leaders must be included or excluded depending on what appears to be their personal agendas or grievances with party leaders.\n\nSome parties have arrogantly told the ANC that they will only consider working with the party if it ditches either President Cyril Ramaphosa or his deputy, Paul Mashatile.\n\nBoth scenarios are untenable. They are unjust and the ANC would be well advised to treat them with contempt.\n\nAny ANC leader can be removed and replaced. But such disqualification cannot and should not be by innuendo insinuating unproven and yet (if ever) to be prosecuted criminal conduct. It most certainly cannot be because its opponents say so.\n\nThe court of public opinion is a kangaroo court that went to a private school. It is nothing more than a sophisticated form of mob justice.\n\nIt is therefore curious that ANC leaders would be persecuted in the name of nobody being above the rule of law, when the persecutors are themselves acting outside the very bounds they claim to hold sacred.\n\nIt would also be a sad day if the ANC would allow for its own democratic processes to be undermined by its opponents, even in the name of a government of national unity. While compromises are the inevitable price of any negotiation, certain principles like the right of members to decide who they are led by and for those elected to accept their fellow elected leaders, must remain sacrosanct.\n\nLest we forget that Ramaphosa and Mashatile contested the presidency and deputy presidency of the ANC and were duly elected by the members of the party. They did not inherit the position from their ancestors or got anointed by someone with special powers.\n\nIf the ANC decides it does not want any of its leaders, it is a decision that must be taken by the same processes that elected them in the first place. The branches must pronounce themselves on the matter. Note that I say it is the branches, not the party leaders and certainly not the party's opponents, who must enjoy the privilege of choosing who must or must not lead the ANC.\n\nEven in chess, the idea is that if necessary, you sacrifice your pawns and not your queen in the understanding that this is part of a long-term strategy to win. If who you sacrifice is determined by the opponent, then they might as well play by themselves.\n\nWhile it is true that the people of SA have spoken and given no single party the absolute majority to form a government on its own, it would be remiss to not recognise that they have also given the ANC the largest number of votes for any one party. The ANC has nearly double the number of voters the party that came second has.\n\nThis may not be what it has been in previous elections but it is not insignificant. In simple terms, there are still more South Africans who believe in the ANC's vision for SA than there are of any other party.\n\nThe ANC must therefore not be so desperate as to forget that it is where it is because of the will of the people who chose the party knowing who its leaders are and which leaders would be returning to the various legislatures if elected.\n\nIf the ANC sacrifices its principles - democratic centralism in particular - and instead tries to curry favour with opponents simply because we recognise that we must co-govern with other parties South Africans have voted for, then the ANC would undermine by the will of its own branches and the over\n\nsix million South Africans who voted for it.\n\nIt might well close shop and become yet another NGO agitating from the sidelines.", "source": {"uri": "sowetanlive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sowetan LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mashatile", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mashatile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kangaroo court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic centralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f1iZGIYQMRHXgpEY0_V5XvTz1HSE8YtLRZmMe92vh0w_MNZnX_jOUIe3Cr40Ub-R4LdBD5WLvbDERNNTVAL5RWPVtc47kwsuB24IJ39ocbaN2A=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It is a ghetto subliminal racism. I have talked to each one of the leaders of the DA who has been removed. What pushes them out? I don't think the latent racism within the DA is about to die. Why would we go to bed with people who actually have a particular perception of black people?\n\n\"They have not changed. We have changed, we went into a coalition with those people who persecuted us because we had to go through a mental change of what's in the best interest of our people. We accepted and respected all the parties. The DA has not changed its DNA. You tell me how many black people (leaders) there are within the DA,\" Sisulu said.\n\nSisulu said \"a marriage between the ANC and DA may not help with the healing process of this beautiful nation\".\n\n\"Allowing the DA to co-govern could bring about a mini-apartheid as we can see how the lives of black people are in the Western Cape where the DA governs. Personally, I didn't go to jail and exile for the DA. As a family we lost approximately 56 years in prison combined as political prisoners under the white man's rule for only asking for justice and equality,\" Sisulu said.\n\nCall to unite under one 'black pact' flag\n\nSisulu said ANC supporters should be asking themselves why would the ANC even consider a union with the DA and not \"our natural allies and brothers and sisters in a form of black pact of progressive forces?\"\n\n\"After all the struggle for our liberation was mainly to disentangle black people from colonialism and apartheid chains. So why are we donating ourselves, including our inherent rich and painful history to our oppressors?\n\n\"I am personally begging you to unite under one black pact flag to continue with the efforts of black liberation and economic emancipation... I beg you to unite on the following points as black progressive parties,\" Sisulu said.\n\nSisulu said she would even help facilitate the meeting of progressive black parties and negotiate to see if they can agree on issues, including an anti-corruption charter to promote clean governance, Africanisation of the law, restoration of state-owned entities (SOE) and a clear position in support for the people of Palestine.\n\nThe Citizen did contact the DA for comment.

It's a very short timeframe.\n\nAs Roelf Meyer, who, with President Cyril Ramaphosa, negotiated the transition from apartheid to democracy, told us in an interview, they had 18 months to get it right.\n\nSo, spare a thought for all the negotiators. It's a time for cool heads to prevail.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC announced it was talking to all represented parties - but that only MK had blue-ticked its conversation openers.\n\nI had an editor once who often said the real test of the ANC's commitment to democracy would only come if and when it slipped below 50% in a national election.\n\nThat moment has come, and until now, its behaviour has been exemplary.\n\nThe party accepted the results and said the voters had spoken.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa warmly thanked the IEC for its work leading up to the announcement of the results on Sunday, June 4, even though it delivered the worst possible news for his party.\n\nThis was the polar opposite of the threatening stance taken by his predecessor and MK party boss, Jacob Zuma, who had warned the electoral body not to finalise results until he said so. Then he tried to gatecrash the results evening midway through Ramaphosa's speech. (He was prevented from entering the building.)\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Democracy 2024 (Day Two) - 15 days to reshape a country\n\n\"The results indicate that South Africans want all parties to work together because no party received an absolute majority to form a government alone at the national level in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal,\" said the ANC in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"The ANC has taken the position that we must act in the interest of our country and its people, and work to build a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history.\n\n\"The ANC is keen and determined to engage all parties and unite the broadest range of sectors of our population behind the urgent need to move our country out of the current potential electoral stalemate.\"\n\nSpokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said the ANC was driven by the imperative to maintain national unity.\n\nThis suggests the ANC is leaning toward a government of national unity (GNU) where all parties that received more than a threshold percentage of votes enter talks to form such a system. One benefit is that parties retain their policies and identities.\n\nThe GNU was the model favoured by parties thrashing out the transition to democracy in 1994, and it worked for a time, although not without a fair amount of drama and tension.\n\nTalks will begin to flesh out what the percentage threshold should be and how to set the rules of the game so that the GNU is not hobbled by delays and differences.\n\nJohannesburg is run by a local \"government of local unity\", which now seems to be working better than previous coalition arrangements, which saw the city change mayors four times since 2021. The challenge is that the parties are so busy managing the coalition that service delivery has gone down the drain. The same shouldn't be allowed to happen at a national level.\n\nBy not responding to the ANC's advances, the MK party appears to be defining itself outside the processes of government formation.\n\nOn Tuesday, 4 June, outside the court where Jabulani Khumalo - who claims to be the rightful leader of the MK party - is taking legal action against Zuma, the former president said the party might boycott the swearing-in of new members of Parliament.\n\nIn KZN, the province where MK has a near majority, the latest news is that the ANC, IFP and DA need the buy-in of the New Freedom Party's Cynthia Shinga to form a government and outfox the new green wave.\n\nThe talks to form a national and two provincial governments are exciting. However, we caution once again that much may change in the hours and days to come.

It is not an oversell or exaggeration to highlight mass mobilisation as the engine of the ANC's popularity and more importantly, its legitimacy as the people's movement.\n\nTo a large degree, what the ANC considers its so-called strongholds today can in fact be traced to mobilisation efforts of the generation of the 1970s to the early '90s. Where every member of a household understood intimately the objectives of the mass democratic movement, understood the particular organisational and political challenges of the times and, importantly, the line of march.\n\nThe outward expression of this was observable during calls for mass boycotts or stay-aways, rallies of organisations linked to the mass democratic movement and the likes.\n\nThey represented the true strength of the movement and gave it an upper hand in the negotiation process. Of course, this was all aided by the oppressive system of the times, where there was one common enemy, aApartheid.\n\nFast forward to 1994 and post, one of the most glaring developments was the erosion of this capacity and mass mobilisation character of the ANC and its alliance partners.\n\nThe preoccupation was the growing importance of the state and its capacity relative to the ANC as an organisation. To an extent this became a major point of discourse in the years immediately following 1994.\n\nAs we reflect on 30 years of democracy and more importantly the epoch-making elections, where the ANC has lost its parliamentary majority, one cannot help but draw parallels between the mass-based ANC and that of today. Accounting for the evolution of time, one glaring observation is the disconnect between the ANC as an organisation and the people.\n\nThe relationship today seems to reside between the people and the state. The ANC only being factored in the equation as the governing party under who the state has collapsed.\n\nBut the ANC as an independent social force in between elections has largely been muted, except leading up to national elective conferences.

Image: Darren Stewart/Gallo Images\n\nA government of national unity is looking the most likely outcome following several stalled coalition negotiations by the ANC's National Working Committee (NWC). The people of South Africa spoke at the polls on 29 May and the ruling party no longer has the majority share of support its 62-million people. Therefore, the party's NWC has been engaging in several important coalition talks.\n\nWith the clock ticking away furiously on the fate of South African government - everything must be in place by Tuesday 18 June 2024 (just five working days away) - NWC insiders say all roads are pointing towards a government of national unity. The Citizen reports that the ANC NWC will meet today (Thursday 6 June) to debate its options.\n\nThe party held a press conference yesterday (Wednesday 5 June) to report back on its various engagements with other parties. A spokesperson said the discussions enriched the ANC's historic mission to build a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, and prosperous South Africa. The ANC has held engagements with all parties, including the DA, EFF, IFP and MK.\n\nEarlier in the week, reports claimed certain members of the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) had threatened to resign if it went through with a proposed coalition with the DA. However, according to the spokesperson, as discussions progressed, it became clear that the people of South Africa were asking its political parties to work together again.\n\nAt this point in time, the ANC appears to be veering towards a government of national unity because this is what the people of South Africa have voted for. And the party is taking an active role in ensuring there is a government in place before the deadline set by the Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Click HERE to see what the law demands from a non-majority coalition government.\n\nSipho Seepe, an expert political analyst, says a government of national unity is the best option to bring as many players into the fold as possible. A coalition with the DA has been met with huge opposition within certain sectors of the party, as well as workers' association COSATU. Meanwhile, a coalition with the MK, EFF and IFP seems to satisfy the party's traditional constituency - \"a unity of the oppressed\", as it's been dubbed - but will see massive economic repercussions.\n\nA government of national unity was last seen in South Africa between 1994-1996, after the country's first democratic elections. The Nelson Mandela-led ANC formed a coalition government with the National Party (NP) and IFP to oversee the transition from apartheid.

This would allow the ANC to maintain its power by partnering with smaller, less established parties and, notably, the Economic Freedom Fighters, which underperformed in the election. According to Eurasia Group analyst Ziyanda Stuurman, this government is most favorable to the ANC as it would \"keep Cyril Ramaphosa as president and provide at least some stability across the political landscape.\"\n\nA coalition with former president Jacob Zuma's newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe party appears highly unlikely because its leader refuses to cooperate unless Ramaphosa steps down, which is non-negotiable for the ANC. Early predictions saw a likely coalition forming between the ANC and the Democratic Alliance, the leading opposition party thatwon almost 22% of the vote.

There have been a few coalitions at provincial and municipal levels but most of these were quite unstable.\n\nThe outcome of the 2024 national election ended 30 years of electoral dominance by the African National Congress. The party garnered only 40.18 percent of the vote while the Democratic Alliance got 21.81 percent, the uMkhonto weSizwe Party 14.58 percent and the Economic Freedom Fighters 9.52 percent.\n\nThis means that the country will need to learn to dance the coalition dance, a dance that under the best of conditions is fraught with partners stepping on each other's toes.\n\nAnd all of this happens in an economy that is not in good shape. South Africa has an economy with negative per capita growth, high and rising unemployment, poverty and inequality, a government deeply in debt, and 26 million people - 42 percent of the population - on grants.\n\nOne possible outcome from ongoing talks is that the African National Congress partners with the radical Economic Freedom Fighters led by Julius Malema and with former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) Party.\n\nAfter 30 years of promises of a better life for all, millions of people feel excluded, left in poverty, with little means to take care of themselves. Zuma and Malema have shown that they know how to capitalise on this sense of exclusion.\n\nThe second option is that the ANC partners with the biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.\n\nLastly, it could opt to run a minority government.\n\nAll three options are fraught with difficulties and dangers.\n\nDisillusionment on the part of former ANC members who joined the Economic Freedom Fighters and uMkhonto weSizwe makes coalition formation with the political left quite difficult. And should it succeed, the economic consequences would likely be quite negative.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters and the uMkhonto weSizwe Party are not business-friendly parties. A coalition with them would likely result in the alienation of investors, a further drop in economic growth and consequently a lack of job creation.\n\nOn the political right, coalition formation between the ANC and the Democratic Alliance would be no less difficult, especially given their significant philosophical differences about the role of government and on how to overcome economic and social challenges. Even if they were to succeed in cobbling together a coalition, it would cause serious instability.\n\nSuch instability would not be conducive for investment. Investors would prefer to stand on the sidelines and observe how such coalitions shaped up.\n\nThe third option, of running a minority government, presents another set of challenges - in particular the prospect of a very unstable government in a permanent state of gridlock. (Examples of minority governments can be found in Canada and a number of European countries.)\n\nThe possible partners\n\nA coalition between the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters or uMkhonto weSizwe is not as straightforward as it might look.\n\nFounded a decade ago, the Economic Freedom Fighters has represented alienated, excluded youth, who feel the deal struck in 1994 doesn't benefit them.\n\nMalema was brilliant in mobilising large numbers of young people. Although his vote in this election waned somewhat, he still, broadly speaking, represents a cohort of younger people disillusioned with ANC policy. And these voters will not necessarily like a coalition with the very same ANC unless it brings them a demonstrable benefit. Anything less will cost the Economic Freedom Fighters support in future elections.\n\nIn the case of Zuma, it is a little more complex. To understand his influence, we need to understand the man and the role he played in KwaZulu-Natal over almost 40 years. In the early 1990s, before the first democratic elections, he played a key role in pacifying the bloody conflict between the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC.\n\nAnd, from very humble, rural beginnings, via the anti-apartheid struggle and prison, he made it to deputy president of both the party and the country. And then President Thabo Mbeki axed him as deputy president of the country following his implication in a corruption scandal.\n\nBut Zuma fought back. And once back, this time as president of the party and the country, he mobilised KwaZulu-Natal in support of the ANC. He remains hugely popular in the province, as the recent election results show. The uMkhonto weSizwe Party garnered 45.9 percent of the vote.\n\nHis lifetime achievement was inspirational to many, because, if a man from such humble beginnings could become president, then anything was possible for everyone.\n\nAs in the case of the Economic Freedom Fighters, it would not be so easy for the ANC to go into a coalition with uMkhonto weSizwe. They represent groups of people seriously aggrieved by the ANC. They are angry and disgruntled. If the ANC wants a coalition with these parties, it will have to offer them something that addresses their anger and disgruntlement.\n\nBut doing that would probably result in rising government expenditure and debt levels. And if that coalition had to raise taxes to deliver on all the promises it made, investors would be likely to run away.\n\nGiven the leftist, statist views of both the Economic Freedom Fighters and uMkhonto weSizwe, we might also see more interventionism, regulations and unwise political support to state-owned entities.\n\nSouth Africans have recently seen the private sector assisting the government in resolving the electricity, transport and harbour infrastructure bottlenecks. That would probably all come to nothing with this type of coalition.\n\nRead more: South Africa: coalition government won't fix past failures - expect the private sector to play a bigger role in delivering power, transport and security\n\nFinancial markets would probably not look favourably on a coalition with populists.\n\nA coalition between the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters or uMkhonto weSizwe would likely be an economic disaster. Either the ANC delivers on all the promises such a coalition will entail, which will be fiscally unaffordable and economically counterproductive, or if they try to contain the fiscal cost, and therefore not deliver on their promises, the coalition will fall apart and introduce further instability.\n\nHowever, there are some clear heads in the ANC who would not like to go down this path.\n\nThe Democratic Alliance\n\nA coalition with the Democratic Alliance could take two forms. One is a real coalition with the ANC and the Democratic Alliance, and possibly other smaller parties like the Inkatha Freedom Party, sharing cabinet positions.\n\nHowever, for a party like the Democratic Alliance this would hold the serious danger that if things were to go badly over the next five years, it would be seen as complicit and lose votes in the next election.\n\nShould the Democratic Alliance nevertheless enter such a coalition, government's economic policy would pivot slightly more pro-market and possibly include a greater focus on frugality and efficiency in government.\n\nBut it would be difficult and time consuming to carry out these sorts of measures with a reluctant senior partner. The resulting frustration on the part of the Democratic Alliance would then likely cause the end of the coalition.\n\nSuch a coalition would be inherently unstable because the parties are philosophically quite far apart. Foreign policy is just one example.\n\nThe second form of coalition between the ANC and Democratic Alliance entails the ANC running the executive branch of government and the Democratic Alliance running parliament - the so-called \"supply and confidence\" model. Thus, the ANC leader would be president and appoint the cabinet with ANC appointees, and the Democratic Alliance might appoint the speaker or deputy speaker, and chairs of parliamentary committees. It would presumably also include an agreement that the Democratic Alliance would support the budget and not introduce a no-confidence vote in the ANC-aligned president.\n\nThe ANC would have to negotiate support for each piece of legislation it brought to parliament. This would result in very little being passed.\n\nWithout an agreement to support the budget and confidence in the president, the ANC would have little incentive to support such a coalition and might prefer to form a minority government.\n\nGoing it alone\n\nA minority government would be very unstable as getting anything through parliament would be almost impossible.\n\nIf the annual budget isn't passed, spending becomes unauthorised - a messy situation politically and economically.\n\nNone of the options on hand would be easy. South Africans need to hang on to their seats. It's going to be a rocky five years.", "source": {"uri": "ippmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IPP Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_prosper@ippmedia.com", "name": "Joseph Prosper", "type":

Where does the ANC get these votes because we have joined the MKP in numbers? We appealed [against the results] before the results were officially announced. Upon hearing our complaint, the [Electoral Commission] rushed to announce the results. I wanted to tell them not to make the mistakes before they fix the mistake we showed them. They are provoking us. We haven't left this matter alone. We are going to walk slowly with them. We are the smartest in South Africa ... we won't back down.\"\n\nThis garbled nonsense is typical of the electoral fraud narrative. The tacit threat of violent reprisal is, of course, an ominous nod to the July 2021 riots. As Zuma put it on Monday:\n\n\"We don't want people to die. We want to show [the IEC] that we are South Africans. We will correct them ... We are number one. We produced big votes. We are silently working on this matter. We have won these elections. We want to rule this country how we want.\"\n\nAlas, democracy doesn't work that way. This is something that Cyril Ramaphosa now understands all too clearly. He has been taught a harsh lesson, but he nevertheless managed to put on a brave face when he addressed the nation on Sunday: -->\n\n\"Whether we like it or not,\" Squirrel said, \"our people have spoken. The people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together to meet their needs. This is a time for all of us to put South Africa first.\"\n\nA bit late in the day for that, you'd think. But, tiny violins aside, something may have now shifted for the better. Perhaps not in a tectonic manner, but there are grounds enough for some optimism. As that familiar adage about South African politics goes: just when it can't get worse, it really does -- but not without some slender chance of redemption, an opportunity to at least think about applying the brakes before plunging into some godawful abyss.\n\nMy glass, then, is perhaps half full rather than half empty. The way the cards have now fallen indicate that, in addition to a national coalition government, alliances must also be formed in KZN, Northern Cape and, crucially, Gauteng. To my mind, this strengthens the argument for devolution of power, and points to a more federalist form of government with provinces managing their own affairs.\n\nKZN is practically there anyway -- at least in spirit. The province, to all intents and purposes, is a whole other place, a hotbed of Zulu nationalism. Back in April, when the parties were on the stump, the leader of the little known Abantu Batho Congress, Philani Godfrey Mavundla, outlined his vision of independence from Pretoria. The Sunday Tribune quoted him as saying, \"We want the land of KwaZulu out of South Africa and we are very clear on that because being part of South Africa is not working for Zulus.\" -->\n\nHere at the Slaughtered Lamb (\"Finest Ales & Pies\"), we believe that it is the other way round, that is is the Zulus who are not working for South Africa. But we're getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nIndependence, Mavundla claimed, was entirely plausible. There are precedents; other southern African ethnic groups had their own independent states, such as Botswana, Lesotho and eSwatini.\n\nWhich is more or less true, but then he muddied his pitch with monarchist piffle and a perhaps unique take on history. \"The colonisers unjustly took the land from the natives,\" Mavundla argued, \"and we are determined to fight for the return of Zulu land to our king and the restoration of the Zulu Kingdom to its former glory before the arrival of colonisers in 1652.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the electorate has condemned to ABC to irrelevancy. But there's no reason why its vision cannot be adopted by the MKP. We should encourage them to do so. After all, they are, despite the fervent denials, fiercely tribal and wholly committed to leading their people back to the 19th century. Who are we to deny them? Let them play with their feathers and spears, just so long as the they keep to themselves.\n\nThe rest of us want to get on with things. It is true that an ANC-DA alliance -- surely the most promising, if not the most likely of all possible alliances -- would be anathema to those in the ruling party's radical economic transformation faction. Lindiwe Sisulu is one such person, a veteran activist whose struggle to free her people from bondage has, in recent decades, been chiefly characterised by an indulgence for gorgonian wigs and Italian shoes. She has warned that such an alliance would amount to a \"betrayal\" of ANC supporters.\n\nShe has instead called for a coalition of black-led parties that, under the leadership of the ANC, would include, among others, the EFF, MKP, Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance. All of whom would be united in comradely fashion under the commons goals of \"black liberation and economic emancipation\".\n\nFine words, but in reality a union likely to be as cosy and fraternal as a sackful of feral cats. Consider, for example, the EFF's conditions for entering a partnership with the ANC: Julius Malema has insisted his deputy, Floyd \"VSB Mutual Bank\" Shivambu, be finance minister and that one of his redshirt MPs be appointed Speaker of the National Assembly. While the MKP would agree to join forces with the ruling party, they would only do so if, in the words of Dudu Zuma-Sambadla, it was \"not the ANC of Ramaphosa\". So, little chance of that.\n\nThis is not to suggest an alliance with the DA would be easy. We have been reminded on numerous occasions in recent weeks that, in the words of international commentators, the DA is regarded as \"a pro-business\" party, one that \"is seen as catering to white interests\". Or, as Sisulu put it, \"Black history in South Africa is painful, and many still bear the scars -- just like me. A marriage between the ANC and DA may not help with the healing process of this beautiful nation.\"\n\nSuch a union would bring back the \"discriminatory practices\" of the past, she added.\n\n\"Allowing the DA to co-govern could bring about a mini-apartheid, as we see how the life of black people is in the Western Cape where the DA governs. Or should we be asking ourselves why would the ANC even consider a union with the DA and not our natural allies and brothers and sisters in the form of a Black Pact of Progressive Forces? After all, the struggle for our liberation was mainly to disentangle black people from colonialism and apartheid chains. So why are we donating ourselves, including our inherent rich and painful history, to our oppressors?\"\n\nFor the benefit of readers who have only just this very minute landed on planet Earth, here are the Western Cape election results: DA 55.29 percent, ANC 19.55 per cent. It's perhaps a little odd that Sisulu chose not to mention this, let alone dwell on the reasons why the party of \"liberation\" routinely fails to earn the trust of the province's electorate. But no matter.\n\nIf the DA brand is such a problem, why not chuck the IFP into the coalition as well, and call it a \"Government of National Unity\"? But, you may well ask, could it be truly one a government of national unity without the EFF or MKP?\n\nAnd the answer would be yes, most certainly, for the emphasis here is on the \"government\", \"national\" and \"unity\". An ANC-EFF-MKK combination would be the \"Mayhem of Outlaws and Ochlocrats\" or MOO option.", "source": {"uri": "politicsweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moneyweb"}, "authors": [],

Just to make things more complicated, the DA will not work with the ANC if it brings MK and the EFF into its coalition government.\n\nAccording to the constitution, a new parliament has to convene within two weeks of the declared results, which highlights the 16th of June. Markets therefore, may have to endure an extended period of uncertainty.\n\nAre you new to FX trading?

USD/ZAR has since headed higher, rising above both the 50 and 200-day simple moving averages where the pair remains currently.\n\nThe effect may have been worse had the US not been on the receiving end of weaker data that has trickled in over recent weeks as inflation appears to be heading lower again and economic growth is looking vulnerable. US real GDP growth for the first quarter (annualized) was revised lower, to 1.5% in the second estimate of the data. Estimates from the initial (advance) figure were originally as high as 2.5%.\n\nSouth African GDP also missed estimates on Monday, aiding the decline. The 19.35 marker represents the nearest level of resistance in the event the rand continues to depreciate, while the 200 SMA and the swing low of 18.044 present the relevant levels of support should markets regain confidence in the political stability of the Southern African nation.\n\nIf you're puzzled by trading losses, why not take a step in the right direction?

Much like USD/ZAR, the pair trades above the 200 SMA and approaches the swing high of 24.59 back in Feb.\n\nHowever, when looking at the RSI indicator, the recent move higher could come under pressure as the pair pulled back at the prior two instances the indicator neared oversold territory. It may be prudent to weigh up the technical signals with the unfolding coalition talks as a 'bad' outcome could see the rand depreciate further from here.\n\nResistance appears at the swing high of 24.59 with support at the 200 SMA around 23.54.", "source": {"uri": "dailyfx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily FX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_snow@dailyfx.com", "name": "Richard Snow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South African rand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee_of_the_African_National_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Executive Committee of the African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMkhonto_we_Sizwe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UMkhonto we Sizwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://a.c-dn.net/b/19dGfe/SOUTH+AFRICAN+RAND+2.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 1555, "textEnd": 1567}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

How the 2024 elections will shape the future - Liberation News", "body": "Photo: EFF leader Julius Malema speaks to media before casting his vote in the elections. Credit: X/@EFFSouthAfrica\n\nThirty years after the first democratic elections in 1994, South Africa finds itself at a political inflection point. The 2024 election saw a collapse in the vote of the ruling African National Congress, gaining only 40% of the vote, 17 percentage points lower than 2019, gaining less than a majority of votes cast for the first time. Turnout was also down 6%. The loss was even more notable as it followed an acrimonious pre-election split in the ANC with former president Jacob Zuma leading a break away party (MK Party).\n\nThe election was also a watershed for the various rightwing parties, who cemented their minority -- but growing -- role in the political landscape. In the wake of the results the political scene is being roiled by negotiations for the first ever coalition government after the end of apartheid. At stake is whether or not South Africa will make rapid progress on poverty and inequality and play a role advancing the struggle to end unipolar U.S. hegemony, or whether it becomes a neutered node for the eroding Western status quo and send its population even deeper into a state of deprivation.\n\nResults and conditions\n\nSouth Africa's voting age population is roughly 42 million, just over 27 million of whom are registered. 16,076,719 registered voters cast ballots. In other words, abstention was the biggest winner of the 2024 election. No political party can claim to represent more than 16% of the adult population. Viewing the elections from the point of view of the voting age population here are the top 4 parties:\n\nCapitalist media is principally framing the election as a rejection of the ANC government. But the results show that, in reality, the election was a rejection of the entire political establishment and the idea that casting a ballot can bring positive change -- a reflection of the dire state of the country.\n\nSouth Africa's mineral wealth is generating at least $125 billion a year, with at the least $2.4 trillion worth of minerals still left in the ground. The companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Africa's largest, were worth roughly $1 trillion in 2023.\n\nHowever, 10% of the population owns 80% of the wealth, with predictable results. Unemployment officially stands at 32.9%, 45.5% among those 15-34. 55% of households do not have running water and 34% still don't have flush toilets. 50% of the country lives in poverty based on official statistics, 65% in rural areas. Further, by some measures, South Africa has the highest level of income inequality on earth. In addition, 75% of farmland is still owned by whites.\n\nThis is also reflected in the results. 64.2% of those who chose to vote went for the ANC, MK or EFF -- all of whom pledged to address these issues more resolutely. The ANC told voters they would \"end poverty by 2030.\" MK and EFF promised voters they will expropriate land without compensation and nationalize mines and banks. Significantly expanded access to healthcare, housing and education, at little to no cost, are touted by all three. Internationally all three have been offering support to Cuba, Palestine, Venezuela and China. EFF leader Julius Malema even pledged to fund Hamas, while MK additionally pledged to prioritize solidarity with Russia.\n\nWhatever one might say about the sincerity or feasibility of particular parties or plans, a clear majority of South African voters are looking for policies that seriously roll back poverty and the legacies of settler colonialism while taking an anti-imperialist approach to international relations.\n\nForces at play\n\nMeanwhile, 27% percent of voters supported political parties clearly representing pro-capitalist, pro-imperialist trends, roughly a 3-4% increase from the 2019 election.\n\nRising right-wing forces represent an attempt by elements of the ruling class to resolve the contradictions between capital and state under ANC rule. The price for the end to de jure apartheid was to leave the white economic aristocracy in place. This was not an ideal situation for the elites however. They had to acquiesce to a combination of demands. First, the demand for Black inclusion at elite and \"middle class\" levels, and second the need to address at least some of the demands of the poor, trade unions and communists that play significant roles in internal ANC politics.\n\nAs the political hegemony of the ANC has frayed, elite forces have increasingly funded an array of opposition parties to try to shift the balance of power more in their favor. At the core is the Democratic Alliance. Funded by ruling class families like the Oppenheimers, and \"newer\" money like gambling boss Martin Moshal as well as some of the largest pro-business political parties in Germany and Denmark.\n\nSimilar donors have spent lavishly in support of parties like ActionSA and Build One South Africa, that try to present a more \"Black\" face on DA-like policies. Others like the Patriotic Alliance, also emanating from elements of the business community, are rooted in a more right-wing \"populist\" approach, stressing in particular an anti-immigrant politics, designed to appeal more to the Black poor.\n\nThese pro-capitalist currents are seeking to exploit the decline and fracture of the ANC to open space to force the ANC into a governing agreement where the demands of \"the market\" are given a greater pride of place and set the stage to overtake them in future elections.\n\nThe ANC is engaged in its own balancing process between its embeddedness with the global imperialist economy and the desire of its base to rapidly accelerate economic transformation. The latter is unlikely to happen without leaning into the shifting sands of multipolarity, further heightening the contradictions with the Western-oriented business elite.\n\nCoalition politics\n\nThis is the context underlying ongoing coalition negotiations. \"The markets\" and the business community are weighing in heavily to create some sort of coalition government between the ANC and the DA. This would be a decisive shift to the right that would undoubtedly involve further privatization of state-owned companies, implementation of austerity budgets, as well as a cooling of relations with the BRICS, Cuba and Palestine. In other words, it's likely to take the country in the opposite direction of where over 60% of the electorate would like it to go.\n\nHowever, other potential coalition options present challenges for the ANC. Both the EFF and MK are splits from the ANC. Pro-capitalist forces in the ANC fear an alliance with either or both parties will make it more difficult to impose the dictates of capital, and in the case of the EFF in particular, strengthen the hand of socialist ideas in the government. Further, the acrimony that exists between these parties also creates hurdles to a coalition agreement.\n\nA number of ANC leaders and the Communist Party have been publicly against an alliance with the DA, and it seems like such a deal would likely further split the organization. The Patriotic Alliance and the Inkatha Freedom Party have also been open to coalitions with the ANC and, alongside the EFF or MK, could easily create a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe outcome of these negotiations will be far-reaching. Will South Africa move towards eliminating poverty and stake out its own ground in a multipolar world order? Or regress towards a role more akin to the former apartheid regime as a node for the West in Africa and beyond?", "source": {"uri": "liberationnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberation

Today's key performance indicator for rapid-growth countries has been their high proportion of young adults who compete internationally by adding value to exports.\n\nThe economic development advantages of carving out and mastering niches in global supply chains are extraordinary. That the ANC categorically rejects this era's wide-volume up escalator explains our dangerously entrenched youth unemployment crisis and, thus, our brittle political landscape.\n\nInvestment-led growth\n\nMany of our top business executives, not unreasonably, sought common ground with ANC leaders through mutually pursuing investment-led growth. However, this path was never going to spur adequate growth or nearly enough new jobs. Rather, it was well-intentioned false advertising.\n\nBy attending investment conferences, ANC elites should have grasped how ill-conceived their policies were. Commercially sensible policy pivots might then have followed. Instead, our political elites chose to expand grants, launch the NHI, and allow people to access their pensions sooner. -->\n\nThe reluctance of capital to flow to our shores is a symptom. The underlying constraint is a lack of customers with purchasing power. This traces to ANC anti-competitive policies leading to would-be workers becoming dependent upon state handouts.\n\nFunding patronage to buy electoral support was never sustainable. That path was washed away by an anti-ANC flood on 29 May. As the EFF and MKP are all too willing to flamboyantly embrace patronage, the ANC must either invite tragic consequences by aligning with them or begin to wean itself off patronage policies.\n\nDA leaders have grasped that all may be lost before 2029. Where they have been caught off-guard traces to their having been playing a long game. They now need a plan to rapidly create millions of commercially viable jobs.\n\nDespite it being quite unlikely that a best-case political outcome would lead to SA's growth trajectory tripling to three or four percent, such an achievement would be very good for investors, while few of our many millions of unemployed young adults would benefit. \"Fixing our economy\" as measured by capital market metrics is the easier and less threatening challenge. -->\n\nA majority of our young adults are stranded, and many of them are in KZN, a province well-acquainted with political killings. President Ramaphosa described the July 2021 riots, which left hundreds dead alongside billions of rands in damage, as an insurrection.\n\nMight MKP's presumed support from Moscow provide the impetus necessary to block the party from running KZN? If so, the province's service delivery and job creation will both need to surge.\n\nUniting\n\nThe Ramaphosa faction of the ANC would soon be sidelined if the party aligns with the EFF or MKP. Whereas his willingness to consistently put party interests ahead of national interests has backfired, an interesting argument for the ANC elites supporting Ramaphosa and rejecting the EFF and MKP is that only his faction is truly committed to uniting the ANC. Another odd consideration is that ANC elites have too much to lose to get into battles which favour the most ruthless.\n\nThe DA's leaders are correct to conclude that if the ANC aligns with either the EFF or MK, our constitutional protections will crumble along with the economy long before 2029. Whereas the DA routinely takes a not-without-a-fight stance, Ramaphosa has favoured compromises. This suggests that in the short- to intermediate-term, the DA can work with and benefit the ANC in various ways.\n\nIt is completely wrong to think that the DA helping the ANC to help needy South Africans would be treasonous. Indulging such a rush-to-judge impulse ignores how SA's democracy has evolved to accommodate coalitions. If there are legitimate elections in 2029, and the DA earns a promotion from 2nd to 1st, it will almost certainly still have to govern within a coalition.\n\nJob Creation\n\nA huge potential error is having job creation remain subordinated to increasing economic growth. The DA must sell the critical importance of having independent initiatives to pursue the two objectives separately.\n\nThe DA must push hard for high labour-absorbing export initiatives to enjoy long tax holidays and broad regulatory exemptions. We are entering the second quarter of the 21st century, and it has long been clear that this century's high-unemployment countries must carve out niches in global supply chains.\n\nThe one common characteristic which will help us transition from a mining-reliant economy to a competitive value-adding exporter is the need for exploration. The market opportunity which led to Red Bull giving Austria wings was not spurred by government regulators; quite the opposite.\n\nSA companies which make an impressive international splash, such as Investec, Discovery, or Nandos, employ few locals to support their international sales. Our patronage-inspired localization, labour and BEE policies unnecessarily lock our young adults out of the international labour market. While our economy gasps due to woefully insufficient purchasing power, the world's wealthiest nations have too few young workers.\n\nHoping to ride the wave of a big resource win is no way to build a 21st-century economy. We, like successful emerging economies, must wade deeply into the wide rivers of affluent consumer markets. As with digital nomads, this need not be contingent on attracting capital flows into SA.\n\nStewardship\n\nThe ANC is not seen as a trustworthy counterpart, as its political and economic stewardship has been so reckless. As a consequence, Ramaphosa dare not trust Putin or Xi. Nor are Western business leaders keen to trust a government aligned with Hamas. The DA is vastly better positioned to build job corridors into supply chains serving Western markets.\n\nPeter Thiel, the legendary technology investor, sees artificial intelligence (AI) threatening mathematically focused professionals while benefiting workers who interact well with people. AI will make it much easier for low-cost workers to routinely provide highly valued interactions. Sometimes geography will be important; other times it will be irrelevant.\n\nWhereas the ANC isn't able to rapidly upgrade its institutional capacity due to pervasive cadre deployment, the DA rightly prides itself on its impressive institutional capabilities. Yet the DA mustn't make the classic mistake of turning a strength into a weakness. The DA and ANC must avoid the temptation of relying unnecessarily on service-level agreements.\n\nInstead, there must be a clear upfront agreement to provide sweeping special dispensations for labour-intensive export initiatives. It is emblematic of how dysfunctional our political economics have become that this should not be difficult for the ANC to accept. There are no material concessions necessary. The beneficiaries of our labour and localization policies have been companies, workers, and governments of other countries.\n\nThe ANC has long been receptive to special economic zones (SEZs) which serve the interests and biases of their alliance partners, the unions, and SACP. Such arrangements were structured with little regard for how demanding global commerce has become.\n\nAll successful nations have adapted to the demands and opportunities that today's global economy presents. The DA must cut a deal where the ANC unambiguously agrees to stop blocking enterprising South Africans.", "source": {"uri": "politicsweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moneyweb"}, "authors":

ANC supporters voted for their beloved party and not the DA. If they were fans of the DA, they would have voted as such, and yet they have not,\" said Sisulu.\n\nSisulu argued that a partnership with the DA would hinder the healing process of the nation.\n\n\"Black history in South Africa is painful, and many still bear the scars just like me. A marriage between the ANC and DA may not help with the healing process of this beautiful nation,\" she said.\n\nSisulu warned that allowing the DA to co-govern could lead to a resurgence of discriminatory practices reminiscent of apartheid.\n\n\"Allowing the DA to co-govern could bring about a mini-apartheid, as we see how the life of black people is in the Western Cape where the DA governs,\" she said.\n\n\"Or should we be asking ourselves why would the ANC even consider a union with the DA and not our natural allies and brothers and sisters in the form of a Black Pact of Progressive Forces? After all, the struggle for our liberation was mainly to disentangle black people from colonialism and apartheid chains. So why are we donating ourselves, including our inherent rich and painful history, to our oppressors?\" said Sisulu.\n\nSisulu urged unity under a Black Pact flag, emphasising the importance of continuing the efforts towards black liberation.\n\nShe outlined an eight-point plan as the foundation for this proposed alliance which includes the following;\n\n1. Anti-Corruption Charter: To promote clean governance.\n\n2. Africanisation of the Law: Incorporating traditional leadership laws.\n\n3. Curbing Illicit Capital Flight: Addressing the unnecessary loss of money from the country.\n\n4. Revival and Stabilisation of SOEs: Restoring state-owned enterprises.\n\n5. Creation of a Sovereign Fund: Using mining industry profits to fund free education.\n\n6. Pushing National Health Insurance (NHI): Improving the safety and security of all citizens.\n\n7. Land Reform: Returning land to its rightful owners, along with its resources.\n\n8. Historical Mission: Emphasizing the significance of liberating black people.\n\n9. Support for Palestine: Taking a clear position in support of the Palestinian people.\n\nIn a clarion call to black leaders Sisulu urged cooperation.\n\n\"I beg you to unite under one Black Pact flag to continue with the efforts of black liberation and economic emancipation.\"", "source": {"uri": "bulawayo24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bulawayo24 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindiwe_Sisulu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lindiwe Sisulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_theology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black theology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkatha_Freedom_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inkatha Freedom Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Cape", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Cape"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Cape"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Land reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tribal chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Blackpowder", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Blackpowder", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.bulawayo24.com/articles/ramaphosa_zille.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Picture: FREDDY MAVUNDA/BUSINESS DAY\n\nI refer to past DA Fedex chair David Gant's letter, \"DA must not compromise\" (June 4). While I agree fully with his comments about the damage the ANC has done to our country, his attitude towards the coalition discussions presently under way is precisely what DA supporters and likely millions of others are fearing.\n\nNot because the party should not make every effort to uphold its principles -- it should -- but because what is also required in these fragile and potentially dangerous circumstances for our country is a commitment from the political parties involved to put SA first, and not their party. That includes the DA.\n\nTo suggest that the DA should seek a political \"reverse takeover\" of the ANC's governance is certainly desirable. However, shouldn't a determination to coalesce sensibly come first? It would also be a presumptuous stance to take at this early stage when considering the ANC and DA positions.\n\nWhile dropping from 57% to 40% is a horrible electoral beating in anybody's language, the ANC still attracted the votes of 6.5-million South Africans. The DA attracted 3.5-million votes, or 3- million less. Isn't that a reality to be respected as hard as it is to swallow?\n\nIn an ANC/EFF/MK coalition, which unquestionably would be a catastrophic outcome from these negotiations, having the DA in the opposition benches in the National Assembly, which Gant argues will be preferable to it conceding any principle, will be akin to voices bellowing into the Grand Canyon. They will not be heard and, if they are, they'll be ignored. It'll be chaotic.\n\nRather, let's hope that the DA's negotiating team achieves a wise combination of upholding its principles and simultaneously knowing when it is in our country's interests to compromise.\n\nWell done to DA leader John Steenhuisen, who has already assured the people of SA that the DA will \"always act in the interests of the people\".\n\nTrevor Munday\n\nvia email", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steenhuisen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Steenhuisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reverse takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OxuWNbnc-hVyv08rM2b1JMQ2MBmRXaYqGM_JxZKjWi8wzypfSdnQRAY15faPhV-0hiewVQq9JFAVZ4kGOcWMgy-uB7M7e1BdMgOrLmrbWrvr-g=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 144, "textEnd": 150}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The US currency weakened in part due to easing labour market conditions in the United States, which added to the case for Fed rate cuts this year.\n\nMarkets have priced in nearly 50 basis points of Fed rate cuts this year, with the first expected to come in September.\n\nData on Wednesday showed the US services sector switched back into growth mode in May after a short-lived contraction the month before, though details of the survey pointed to employment remaining in contraction territory.\n\n\"While new orders suggest continued demand, the selected industry comments and continued employment contraction reveal a touch of caution among service providers,\" said economists at Wells Fargo.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@news24.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South African rand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkatha_Freedom_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inkatha Freedom Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/11901/2c6082f4d3ce4af683489f45ae6679f1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626742", "eventUri": "eng-9626742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

In the highly competitive poll, ANC was relegated to the largest single party with 40 percent of the vote. The ANC founded in 1912 was no longer the majority party.\n\nIn 2019, it had lost its two-thirds majority. Voters felt that ANC had not done enough to stifle corruption. Unemployment is high, about 40 percent of the workforce. The ANC had delivered a lot of social infrastructure but it really lost the heart of young people who as elections should be are about the future not the past.\n\nThe ANC is likely to enter into either a leftist coalition with both MK, the party of former President Jacob Zuma and EFF, the rabble-rousing leftist party led by former head of the ANC's youth wing Justus Malema, both of whom are pushing ANC to redistribute land and other strategic economic resources. The two parties won 58 and 39 seats in the National Assembly respectively. This coalition would command 236 seats in the lower house.\n\nA right-left pro-business coalition is also possible, with Cyril Ramaphosa at its head, with the Democratic Alliance would command 246 seats. However, the bases of the two parties may not align.\n\nThe ANC would be seen moving further away from its roots unlike the ANC-MK-EFF coalition all branches cut from the same tree. The Democratic Alliance in power in the Western Cape is seen as a representative of the \"haves\". It leans right in many respects similar to Germany's Free Liberal Democrats.\n\nCape Town remains at the center of one of the country's richest urban centers but around it is crushing poverty. This coalition would likely address some of South Africa's Achilles heels, corruption and immigration. It would also address another problem, a steady stream of emigration of South Africa's white population.\n\nOne easy-to-discern result from South Africa will be the lowering of the rhetoric by EFF after they were squeezed into fourth place by MK. Interestingly prior to the election, South African Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nkaqila resigned on April 3 after she was arrested and charged with multiple counts of corruption dating from her tenure as Defence Minister.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Tories are staring down an uncertain future as a much smaller parliamentary party. Current projections indicate the Tories 350 seats may fall to as low as 66 seats, numbersunheard of in recent UK parliamentary history. Labour is projected to win from 400 to as many as 420 seats.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats may overtake the Scottish Nationalists with at least 50 seats in Parliament. Even the tiny Greens' long holding just one seat, Brighton Pavilion may win their second seat in the Commons. Britain's Reform Party also re-entered the fray announcing rabble-rouser Nigel Farage a candidate for their old seat of Clacton, 70 miles east of London.\n\nFurther east in India, the world's biggest democracy with over 600 million voters, the ruling BJP lost its outright parliamentary majority and the Congress-led opposition survived a death call. BJP saw its target of 400 MPs in the Lok Sabha shredded to just 242. BJP and its allies will hold 292 seats in Prime Minister Modi's third term, while Congress and her allies will hold 242 seats.\n\nModi seemed to turn off poorer voters and those who believe in India's secular democratic traditions. For now, he won't be able to amend the constitution.\n\nIn Mexico, voters gave a stamp of approval for the leftist party of the incumbent, electing the first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum, granddaughter of Jewish immigrants. The runner-up was a woman as well.\n\nPower sharing makes authoritarian rulers uncomfortable, but is inevitable. In the region, one or more forms of power sharing are on display in Kenya and the DRC.\n\nIn Kenya, though they have exposed two glaring problems. The ruling coalition is led by the regions that have benefited the most from independence, and the opposition coalition is the opposite.\n\nNeedless to say, the regions, in between provided the winning margin and were rewarded with the Speakership of Parliament and position of Prime Cabinet Secretary.\n\nOver the weekend, ANC, the party of Musalia Mudavadi who is increasingly likely to be President Ruto's running mate in 2027 announced plans to fold itself into UDA the largest party in the Kenya Kwanzaa coalition.

The African National Congress (ANC) he led won barely 40 per cent in South Africa\u2019s general election, a veritable collapse in support after garnering just 57.5 per cent of votes in 2019, a record low then.\n\nThe ANC has mainly lost support among young people. An AtlasIntel poll just before the election showed the ANC had the support of over half of those surveyed who were over 60 years but just 27 per cent of those aged 16-24 (16-18 years old can register but not yet vote).\n\nThe younger generation \u201cunderstandably didn\u2019t go through the struggle era, so they don\u2019t feel the loyalties to the ANC\u201d, said ANC member of parliament Yunus Carrim.\n\nThe changing youth vote is a familiar headache for many political parties, including in the West. Ahead of Poland\u2019s election last year, which unseated the Law and Justice (PiS) party after eight years, exit polls showed that while older voters supported establishment parties, young women increasingly favoured the far-left, while young men flirted with the far-right, even openly misogynistic parties.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has further radicalised young people, with elite college campuses in the United States erupting into confrontations between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters. Ahead of the November presidential elections, Joe Biden is facing pressure to stop supporting Israel or face the wrath of young voters.\n\nOpinion polls show that young people are broadly dissatisfied with Western institutions and society, and pushing for more radical changes.\n\nIn South Africa, opinion polls point to a slightly different picture: the discontent is general and unconfined to any demographic group. It\u2019s not hard to see why.\n\nAside from older issues of corruption and \u201cstate capture\u201d as well as the challenges of being stuck in the so-called middle-income trap, in recent years, South Africa has also seen rising food prices, extremely high unemployment and frequent rolling blackouts. The post-Covid hit to the popularity of most incumbent governments is likely to have affected the ANC too.\n\nThe country\u2019s largest opposition party, Democratic Alliance, has also seen an erosion of local support after being challenged by the upstart Patriotic Alliance. The former, which prides itself on being a \u201cnon-racial\u201d party, has been accused by the latter of taking its minority supporters for granted, in particular the community previously classified as \u201ccoloured\u201d under the apartheid regime (as opposed to \u201cwhites\u201d, \u201cblacks\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d).\n\nThis has international parallels: the US Democratic Party is panicking over the possibility that Latino and black voters might abandon it en masse.\n\nAnother major reason for ANC\u2019s defeat was the sudden political re-emergence of Jacob Zuma, whose new party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), won 14.6 per cent of the vote. Many suspect the return of the former president, who still faces corruption charges, is aimed at taking his fight for justice into the court of public opinion.\n\nComparisons with Donald Trump abound, not least because when Zuma was taken into custody in 2021, his supporters launched the worst riots South Africa had seen since apartheid.\n\nFor all its shortcomings, the ANC would say \u2013 and even critics from the West would agree \u2013 that it has managed the monumental task of leading a divided country out of the shadow of apartheid to form a united and dynamic multiracial democracy.\n\nSadly, this might no longer be the case. The real election story may be of growing divisions. The rise of Zuma\u2019s party, MK, is based on concentrated support among the Zulus, the largest ethnic group in South Africa, while the upstart Patriotic Alliance is swiftly positioning itself as a platform for minority interests.\n\nGiven South Africa\u2019s painful history, these are extremely troubling developments. While the trend of ethnic polarised voting in South Africa is still emerging, the sorting of demographic groups into parties means that each political battle also becomes a de facto fight between ethnic groups \u2013 a danger for any democracy. There might yet be more unscrupulous politicians like Zuma to exploit and enlarge divisions for personal gain.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen where this could lead, if unchecked. Religious-political polarisation in Lebanon led to decades of civil strife and societal dysfunction, while Bosnia is once again threatened by Serbian separatism. There are counter examples, to be sure, such as the eventual amity between French and English-speaking Canadians, where the answer seems to lie in prosperity and a willingness to compromise.\n\nIn South Africa, the only major piece missing for a truly Balkanised political landscape is the formation of more parties catering to black ethnic groups, in particular a Xhosa nationalist party.\n\nXhosas, the second largest ethnic group after the Zulus, are the support base of the ANC, with Mandela and many ANC elders hailing from the grouping, so a Xhosa nationalist party doesn\u2019t exist. But it\u2019s entirely plausible that this could change as the ANC tries to put out political fires everywhere and fails to centre on Xhosa issues.\n\nFor all its faults, the ANC has always worked across the aisle, offering leading opposition MPs seats in the cabinet. The same cannot be said of most opposition parties, which emphasise their refusal to work with certain others.\n\nIf South Africa, the country once hailed as the \u201crainbow nation\u201d and a symbol of racial reconciliation, finds itself going down the path of Lebanon and even Yugoslavia, it would not just be catastrophic to everyone who loves South Africa but also ominous for the idea of diverse, multiracial democracies.\n\nLee Jersey Wang is an associate with Beijing Club for International Dialogue and an international affairs analyst", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType":

As NUMSA we have consistently raised and registered the neoliberal and destructive nature of the macroeconomic policy in the form of GEAR that the ANC government adopted in 1996 which:\n\na. Liberalised trade leading to disastrous levels of deindustrialisation.\n\nb. Removed exchange controls, allowing money we desperately needed to be invested into productive sectors of the economy to leave the country both legally and illegally.\n\nc. In the past 3 decades we have bemoaned the crisis caused by the neoliberal macroeconomic framework which championed austerity measures and as such it hollowed out the role of the state in the economy and in delivering critical strategic infrastructure to our people such as roads, schools, hospitals, leading to closure of agriculture, nursing and teachers colleges. As a result of this macroeconomic framework and its belt-tightening, government failed to deliver free and compulsory education.\n\nd. These global market forces even dictated to the ANC government not to touch coal and as a result the whole country was plunged into the catastrophe of rolling blackouts, crippling the South African economy at the expense of many jobs that have been lost when all that was supposed to be done was to do all what other countries are doing which is a continuous quality maintenance of power stations in order to secure 75 % Energy Availability Factor. All of these countries and institutions who dictated to south Africa to follow a wrong transition in handling the movement from fossil fuels to renewables, their baseload is on coal, nuclear and gas but they had guts to dictate to South Africa and its people, despite us being a sovereign country, what energy mix we must have, instead of allowing us as a sovereign country to decide on an energy mix that will suit our economy and enable us to power our communities. This agenda of collapsing Eskom is not a neutral agenda. It is a dangerous agenda that has got a mission to privatise our country's energy provision and that as NUMSA, we remain firm in rejecting the breaking Eskom up into 3 separate divisions such as generation, transmission and distribution. -->\n\ne. When the National Development Plan (NDP) was introduced, which was supposed to be an alternative to GEAR, we were very clear then that this was nothing but pacification of the South African public and it did nothing to restructure the South African economy. It didn't prioritise job creation, the only jobs it talked about were window-office cleaning and hairdressing. What was extremely bad was that we discovered and exposed the fact that this was a clear policy of the Democratic Alliance, as we compared it clause by clause with the DA policy. That is why the NDP failed dismally to meet all its targets and objectives.\n\nIt is against this background that as a union we want to be on record and remind the ANC and its leadership that it has lost political power and the confidence of the masses, because of not implementing this revolutionary agenda we are talking about. Therefore, it is not in choosing any political party to be in coalition with the ANC that will not advance solutions to the frustrations of the masses of the people who are victims of poverty, unemployment and inequalities as a result of the ANC in 1994 political breakthrough having secured political power without economic power for the masses of our country, which will resolve the crisis in South Africa today.\n\nFor the ANC to regain the confidence of the people, it needs to move away from the hollow and now clearly expired negotiated settlement and go for the affirmation of the masses of our people into ownership and control of the economy, including addressing the burning land question through nationalisation without compensation as the only way of changing power relations in order to realise the fundamental vision and goals of our liberation struggle and genuine non-racialism, non-sexism and fundamental transformation of South Africa. This, the ANC cannot do through a coalition with the DA, as the DA in its political posture, its policies, define it it as the political axis of the ruling class, and it is its mission and reason for existence to oppose the liberation of the oppressed and still colonised Black and African peoples of this country. It advances nothing that is about the liberation of the Blacks and African people in our country who remain economically marginalised, landless and dispossessed in the past three decades.\n\nIt is NUMSA's clarion call for a couple of reasons, that yes the ANC must engage with all other black left political parties in order to form a government. It must leave out the Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus for obvious reasons. Freedom Front Plus champions no aspirations for blacks and Africans. -->\n\nThe DA is worse as it is has demonstrated that it is a right wing Zionist organisation, which supports Apartheid Israel. It supports Israel's ethnic cleansing andtherefore genocide of Palestinians. In its manifesto, it promises to abolish the National Minimum Wage, and it wants to make embarking on a strike even more difficult, by forcing unions to pay a deposit; the DA also wants a 'flexible' labour market which means that basic protections and benefits which workers have fought decades for, will be lost with a coalition with the DA.\n\nThe DA in its manifesto, vowed that if it were to win political power (which now we hear that it must win political power through a backdoor through a coalition with the ANC) has announced that it will abolish all incentives that are supporting the auto industry, the tyre industry, the component value chain in the manufacturing sector and the textile sector. and this is what they said in their manifesto:\n\n\"Perpetual subsidies, which provide benefits based on ongoing operational behaviour. Perpetual subsidies can become difficult to reduce as they eventually form part of the operational budget of beneficiary companies. These types of subsidies are aimed at creating or retaining industries that would not ordinarily reside in South Africa were it not for the subsidy. An example of these types of subsidies includes our automotive and clothing industries, which would unlikely continue operations within South Africa if subsidies were reduced. However, it is not clear that these industries produce benefits to South Africa that justify their high levels of subsidisation. If the subsidies are not yielding an economic benefit larger than the support provided, then their continued provision should be reconsidered. One example is the number of subsidies provided to the automotive industry, with only 9 out of 42 national departments receiving a budget larger than the R31 billion in automotive subsidies provided in 2021. Furthermore, from 2009 to 2021, subsidies to the automotive industry grew by 130 percent, while employment grew by 15 percent.\"\n\nIf this vision of the DA were to be implemented in partnership with the ANC in a coalition, it is poor provinces who are already victims of austerity measures of GEAR who will be rendered ghost towns where the poverty of our people will continue to be their life experience. If VWSA, Isuzu, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota South Africa, Ford Motor Company, and Nissan were to close as a result of this reckless policy of the DA, provinces like the Eastern Cape and rural towns, and KZN, community of Uitenhage in Nelson Mandela Metro, East London and the people of Mdantsane, the people of Tshwane, if these auto companies and the component value chain that benefit from the incentives to be closed by the DA, the levels of unemployment that is already worse will deepen. The level of crime, and all other social ills associated with it, will sky-rocket. It is against such a backdrop that we are asking permission from no-one, but we are calling on all of those who care in the ANC-led alliance and the rest of all other progressive political parties in the country, that there should be no coalition of the ANC with the DA. But the ANC can enter into coalition with the rest of other progressive political parties that have won seats from the 29 of May elections.\n\nThis call is in the interests of the working class and the poor of our country whose outcome of elections constitutes a clarion call to all progressive political parties that it is about time to go back to the revolutionary agenda which cannot be pursued with the Democratic Alliance, and John Steenhuizen and Hellen Zille.\n\nThe strategic important task is to put together a government that is going to address the crisis of unemployment, poverty and inequalities through an expansionary budget with a particular focus in building infrastructure in order to stimulate demand and that all our country's SOEs that have been weakened and collapsed must be recapitalised, to play their catalyst role in stimulating economic growth and that procurement and designations must be deployed to champion localisation, and create the most needed jobs, and deliver quality basic services and meet the basic needs of the people.\n\nWe reject with the contempt it deserves the misleading of the public that a coalition with the DA would create economic stability. The fundamental question is stability for what and for whom? The very same argument was advanced when GEAR was adopted in 1996, GEAR was adopted as a macroeconomic stabilisation policy for markets, but in South Africa the unemployment rate is 41.9%. South Africa is number one in the world in terms of inequality.\n\nNUMSA views the coalition with the ANC and DA as not a light at the end of the tunnel, but an oncoming train that will squash and liquidate the working class. Should the ANC/DA coalition happen, we shall be left with no option, but to go back to basics given the despondence of the working class and the poor and call on all trade unions and all left political parties that represent the working class to unite and embark on a rolling mass action in pursuit of the demands of the working class and to pursue class struggle for a Socialist South Africa as the only guarantee for fundamental change.\n\nThere will be no necessary \"stability\" of Black and African hunger, unemployment, poverty and inequality that will be provided by an ANC coalition with the DA, instead this would spell a final nail in the coffin of the ANC.", "source": {"uri": "politicsweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moneyweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The sun will still rise tomorrow. And despite Jacob Zuma's notorious and blasphemous prophecy, the ANC will not rule until Jesus comes again.\n\nThat the ANC has lost so badly and is unlikely ever to regain its majority is not bad news for our country. It is good news. Looking at the mess this once-impregnable party has made of South Africa, it is not surprising the voters have punished it. There is scarcely an aspect of life or government at every level that the ANC has touched that is not failing.\n\nUnlike some, I am optimistic about the opportunity for a new and better chapter to open. The proviso is that the Communists and others in the ANC do not pressure that party into entering into a coalition of doom with the EFF and MK. That would be utterly unacceptable to most voters and spell death to our chances of growth, investment, and tackling unemployment. Such a coalition would see the Rand plunging in value, even more skilled taxpayers leaving the country, and investors putting their money in other safer, developing economies.\n\nA government of National Unity (GNU) that included MK and the EFF would make it impossible for the DA to join. Can you imagine a cabinet with Julius Malema in it? He is already insufferable, even though his party had a reverse in the election, losing a number of seats, and one cannot imagine Ramaphosa, or anyone else, controlling his ego or his actions. Remember also that he demands his side-kick Floyd Shivambu be the minister of Finance. The hapless Des van Rooyen was the minister of finance for a weekend, but he is now a leading member of MK. One wonders whether Zuma will insist that van Rooyen be anointed again.

The only questions are how the power is to be shared and with whom you will share it.\n\nThe end point is far more complex, because these are not straightforward questions. There are myriad options.\n\nThe process of determining the outcome will go up a gear, once the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) has met today (Thursday). Since it is the structure of the organisation with the highest decision-making authority between national conferences, its view of life matters a lot.\n\nBut, an 80-person committee can't conduct the negotiations; it can merely steer the ship by providing guidance and, then, later, sign off on any final agreement, if indeed agreement is reached.\n\nWhat if no deal is reached? Patience please. I will get to that in a moment. First, however, an additional word about the NEC, which will apparently receive an initial position from the National Working Committee (NWC) of the ANC - a 15-person \"exco\" elected by the NEC that generally meets weekly.\n\nIn its wisdom, the NWC has suggested that because voters have decided that they want all parties to work together in government, then the right response is to have an all-encompassing \"government of national unity\" (GNU).\n\nEvery party elected to the National Assembly - all 18 of them - will be invited to join. This is self-evidently absurd.\n\nFirst of all, the electorate decided that it did not want any one party to have a majority and, therefore, that power must be shared. But it provided no mandate as to who should share power.\n\nDo MK voters want to share power with the DA? Methinks not. Nor so the DA with the EFF or MK.\n\nSecond, does any voter want their vote so diluted in government that nothing can get done because it will be well-nigh impossible to agree a policy agenda with so many players involved?\n\nAny coalition needs to go through a very careful, clear and candid phase of exchanging \"redline\" issues - the policies and principles that are non-negotiable to it, and which must be sufficiently catered for in the agreed programme for power-shared government. Such a process will be impossible with so many players.\n\nHence, such an all-encompassing GNU will be a never-ending negotiation at a time when South Africa needs a decisive government that can confront the myriad challenges the country faces.\n\nAccordingly, it would likely lead to the sort of transactional approach to coalition-building that has been the hallmark of the unstable and unsavoury coalitions in several local governments in recent years. The negotiations will be centred on who gets what, rather than what is it that the new government should do.\n\nBesides, politically it will fail to get out of the starting gate. The DA will walk away. Perhaps the IFP too. MK may refuse to participate in any case. What will be left will be the ANC and the EFF, and a bunch of mice and rats.\n\nNot an edifying prospect. And one that will place a high degree of influence in a party that is not known for its reliability as a coalition partner, and with the support of less than one in 10 voters, and a disproportionately high degree of power in the hands of some very small parties.\n\nIs that what the electorate decided it wants? Probably not.\n\nPerhaps the NWC knows that this will happen and wants first to show that it is fully open-minded to all parties and options before returning to a more sensible and stable option or options.\n\nWhich takes us to the range of options available. There is a spectrum. At one end is a full coalition agreement. Think of it as wedlock, with the deal wrapped up with a bow, and a commitment to share power through thick and thin and until death do us part.\n\nPotentially very stable and with potential to increase accountability, both within and without government, with the married couple keeping a close eye on each other.\n\nOf course, eyes can wander. Not every marriage lasts forever.\n\nOr it might be stronger as a threesome. For example, the IFP might join a \"grand coalition\" between the ANC and DA - \"grand\" because it contains the two biggest parties. One might call this a \"mini-GNU\".\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum there is no deal at all. Or, at least, no deal that can be struck within the tight time frame that the Constitution imposes: a new president must be elected at the first sitting of the National Assembly, which must take place 14 days from when the election result was declared last Sunday.\n\nIn this case, the ANC will no doubt nominate a candidate for president. With 159 of the seats, it is still by far the biggest party in the National Assembly. It would take 160 MPs from the other parties that make up the balance of the other 60% of seats in the National Assembly to agree to support the nomination of another candidate for president in order for the ANC's candidate to lose. That, of course, is highly unlikely, because it would require a deal, at the very least, between the DA and the EFF or the DA and MK, as well as some others. So, in one form or another, Cyril Ramaphosa should emerge from that first sitting as President.\n\nBut, in the absence of any agreed support for Ramaphosa from other parties, it will be an inherently weak government. And yet it may be preferable to having to negotiate complex coalition agreements with potential partners, all of whom bring political discomfiture of one sort or another.\n\nWhich brings us to the middle way: a confidence-and-supply agreement or framework. Such an agreement is one where the smaller party or parties agree to supply their support for as long as they have political confidence in the bigger party and its president (and Cabinet).\n\nThere is no power sharing in terms of executive power; the support parties do not take seats in Cabinet. The support parties would be given some other benefits as an incentive to stick to the arrangement, such as key positions in other parts of the state apparatus, including the legislature, or another executive (such as a provincial one); and/or a commitment that the minority government will pursue some specific points of law and policy, but not necessarily all.\n\nStable and accountable or unstable and unaccountable? It depends. On the precise terms of the confidence-and-supply agreement or framework. There are such agreements that are vague or obtuse, such as the ones that have existed in some city halls in South Africa in recent years, and which tend to be shallow and unstable.\n\nOr they can be deep and detailed, and potentially far more stable. The devil is in the detail, especially in relation to what does or does not constitute \"confidence\" and, specifically, when and on what basis a no confidence vote can be triggered - because that is the ultimate sanction for a minority government that does not have a coalition agreement in place.\n\nPolitical history is littered with both categories of confidence-and-supply arrangements. In Canada in 2022, for example, the smaller National Democratic Party (NDP) agreed to support the biggest party, the Liberal party, on an agreed - and published - confidence-and-supply package, which included agreement about when and for how long it would provide support, as well as agreement from the minority Liberal government as to which NDP policies it would advance in government. But, the NDP did not take up positions in the cabinet.\n\nOne upside of such a confidence-and-supply framework agreement is that one party in government decides on the government's programme. So, there should be greater policy coherence, at least in theory. Another is that the smaller parties can retain the independence and preserve their own political brand, and not risk having it diluted through power sharing in government.\n\nTransparency in relation to the terms of the arrangement and the reasons for it will be crucial for public legitimacy.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Elections dashboard\n\nThere is a great deal to think about. Current positions, some of which are trenchantly held, will have to either solidify or dissolve. Compromise will need to be the name of the game, otherwise no deal of any sort will emerge, and the period of uncertainty will be extended.\n\nMature and wise leadership is needed. Political leaders will need to rise to the moment.\n\nThe right questions will need to be asked. Not \"do we like this party?\" nor even \"which is the least bad option\". But rather, \"which plausible and realistic option will deliver a sufficiently stable and accountable government on which to serve our political interests and those of the country?\"", "source":

Picture: SHARON SERETLO/GALLO IMAGES\n\nThe elections in KwaZulu-Natal have ushered in a significant shift in the political landscape of the province. The results have delineated a clear picture of the populace's preferences, yet they also forewarn of potential challenges ahead. The outcomes are as follows: uMkhonto weSizwe party (MK) -- 37 seats, IFP -- 15 seats, ANC -- 14 seats, DA -- 11 seats, EFF -- two seats, and NFP -- one seat, out of a total of 80 seats in the provincial legislature.\n\nAt the forefront of this shift is the MK party, securing 37 seats. This victory, however, comes with substantial concerns. The MK party, led by Jacob Zuma, a figure synonymous with corruption, fraud and state capture, has a troubling foundation. Zuma's tenure as president of SA was marred by scandal, and his association with the MK party casts a long shadow over its legitimacy and governance potential.\n\nThe MK party's stance against free market enterprise, the constitution, nonracialism, and equality before the law poses a direct threat to the democratic and economic stability of KwaZulu-Natal. Their policies, though not formally recorded anywhere, suggest a move towards a more centralised and state-controlled economy, which historically has not yielded positive results for any region. This approach could stifle economic growth, deter foreign investment, and lead to increased unemployment and poverty.\n\nThe MK's potential coalition partner, the EFF, secured two seats. While their presence in the legislature is relatively small, their influence cannot be underestimated. The EFF, led by Julius Malema, is known for its authoritarian leadership, opposition to property rights, and racially divisive rhetoric. Their policies advocate nationalisation and a strong central state, aligning closely with the MK party's vision.\n\nA coalition government committed to democratic principles and economic stability could steer KwaZulu-Natal towards a prosperous future\n\nAn MK-EFF coalition government would be disastrous for KwaZulu-Natal. Such a coalition would likely steer the province away from the principles of free market enterprise, potentially leading to economic regression. The EFF's track record of racially charged politics could worsen social tensions in a province already grappling with its diverse demographic makeup.\n\nThe IFP, with 15 seats, and the ANC, with 14 seats, hold a significant portion of the legislature but fall short of forming a majority. The DA, with 11 seats, also represents a substantial share. These parties, while diverse in their political ideologies, generally uphold the principles of free market enterprise, constitutional democracy, and nonracialism.\n\nIn this fragmented legislature, the possibility of coalition politics looms large. The IFP, ANC and DA could potentially form a coalition to counterbalance the MK-EFF alliance. Such a coalition, though ideologically diverse, would be united in its commitment to maintaining democratic principles and promoting economic stability. This coalition could provide a crucial check against the MK-EFF's more extreme policies.\n\nHowever, forming and maintaining such a coalition would require significant political will and compromise. The IFP, ANC and DA would need to find common ground on key issues and present a united front. This task, while challenging, is not insurmountable and could provide a viable path forward for KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nThe election results also reflect the electorate's desire for change. The MK's significant win suggests a disillusionment with the status quo, particularly with the ANC, which has dominated SA politics for decades. This desire for change, however, must be carefully navigated to avoid replacing one set of problems with another.\n\nKwaZulu-Natal stands at a critical juncture. The choices made by its political leaders in the coming months will have far-reaching implications for the province's future. An MK-EFF coalition government would likely lead to economic decline and increased social tensions. Conversely, a coalition of the IFP, ANC and DA could provide a stabilising force, promoting economic growth and social cohesion.\n\nThe elections in the province have highlighted the complexities and challenges of the political landscape. The electorate has voiced a desire for change, but the path forward requires careful navigation. A coalition government committed to democratic principles and economic stability could steer KwaZulu-Natal towards a prosperous future. The alternative, an MK-EFF alliance, poses significant risks. It is incumbent on the political leaders to rise to the occasion, prioritise the province's best interests, and work towards a stable and prosperous future for all its citizens.\n\n* Pappas is the

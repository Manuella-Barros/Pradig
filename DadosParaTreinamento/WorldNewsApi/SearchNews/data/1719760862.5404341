Yet a significant portion of their day is consumed by tiring administrative tasks, with nearly 40% of their time spent on manually documenting and reviewing patient records. Although these tasks are essential for making informed decisions around screening, treatment and trial referrals, this exhausting routine inevitably pushes clinicians toward burnout. Moreover, patients can consult clinicians for a variety of conditions, with overlapping symptoms. This, combined with the time-intensive nature of manually reviewing patient records, means that important clinical features that warrant clinical attention can be easily missed. Consequently, patients can remain untreated (e.g., undiagnosed or misdiagnosed) and suffer worse health outcomes. For instance, research indicates that an estimated 50% to 65% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are undiagnosed and that delayed COPD diagnosis increases exacerbation rates. As patient health deteriorates, the financial and resource strain on healthcare facilities also intensifies. Annual treatment costs for very severe COPD, for example, are nearly three times higher compared to mild COPD. Taken together, these statistics paint a picture of how the limitations of manually reviewing patient records can create a vicious cycle of surging demands for healthcare provider sites (HCPs). To make matters worse, even diagnosed patients can still be missed for clinical trial recruitment or therapies, given that diagnostic coding errors occur in up to 89% of medical records. Potential Roles Of LLMs In Healthcare Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, sophisticated tools that can understand and generate language. Research indicates that LLMs can automate the laborious process of manually reviewing patient information, thereby improving clinician workflows. Companies such as my own are researching the application of LLMs for various clinical tasks, such as: MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A \u2018Tyrant\u2019 Outside Courthouse \u2022 Finding patients whose medical records meet certain clinical criteria for screening (pre- or post- diagnosis). Based on an earlier (much smaller) form of LLMs combined with clinical inputs, clinicians found six times more cachectic cancer patients based on their records who would have been missed by ICD-code searches. The integration of LLMs into these products could increase this number and the accuracy of such patient discovery tools, since LLMs can accurately and rapidly process large volumes of text. Additionally, LLMs are not limited to just textual data since they can help process patient data in different modalities, such as images, audio, blood tests and genomic data. \u2022 Summarizing patient records. Patient records are captured in formats such as unstructured clinical notes and structured data. The utility of this application has been supported by publications where clinical text summaries from adapted LLMs were deemed more complete and correct than human summaries. \u2022 Making scientifically sound suggestions for clinical investigations, treatments and diagnoses based on patient records. As demonstrated in this publication, LLMs can provide accurate, well-justified and complete answers about patients\u2019 likely primary diagnoses, secondary diagnoses and complications. LLMs could therefore corroborate clinicians\u2019 diagnostic and management decisions in a clinically valid manner. Overall, studies suggest that LLMs could support clinical workflows in numerous ways, enabling timely care, improved patient health and reduced clinician burnout. This could equally benefit pharmaceutical companies by enabling more suitable patients to be matched to clinical trials and commercial therapies. Challenges With LLMs And How To Overcome Them However, limitations of LLMs need to be addressed before they can be applied in the clinic. Various publications highlight the challenges that still need to be overcome, such as: \u2022 Finding Patients: LLMs can struggle to find patients consistently across conditions. This was evidenced by the above publication, which demonstrated that ChatGPT and GPT-4 achieved only 48% and 79% accuracy (respectively) when tasked with finding patients who had herpes simplex virus (HSV) based on patient records and existing guidelines. \u2022 Lack Of Explainability. In the same publication, ChatGPT struggled to explain patients\u2019 diagnoses in a \"scientifically correct\" manner when step-by-step reasoning was required\u2014for instance, when calculating and retrieving a potential COPD patient\u2019s exacerbation risk and GOLD group. \u2022 AI Hallucinations: LLMs are susceptible to artificial hallucinations and may present fake explanations. For instance, LLMs may assert that a patient\u2019s medical record contains a mention of a specific diagnosis when it does not. \u2022 Privacy Concerns: Privacy concerns may arise when applying LLMs in healthcare since medical data could be sent to external servers outside of HCPs, unless they develop the relevant infrastructure to run such LLMs locally. Previous studies, for instance, have highlighted twelve privacy risks associated with the application of artificial intelligence. While concerning, various software providers are looking to address these limitations in a variety of ways. For instance, LLMs typically perform better with more elaborate prompts and more training data. Evidence shows that GPT-4, being larger and more complex, outperforms smaller models like ChatGPT in clinical tasks; however, this performance difference can be reduced by providing ChatGPT with more elaborate prompts. Clearly presenting LLM-generated insights is also key to gaining clinicians\u2019 trust, although this is challenging due to the complexity of these models. One way to achieve this would be to prompt LLMs to justify their responses such that clinicians can verify the care recommendations before using them. Finally, deploying small and distilled LLMs locally where patient data is stored\u2014which are optimized for specific healthcare tasks\u2014could enable HCPs to use LLMs without moving patient data or breaching privacy. Smaller LLMs also do not require high specifications for infrastructure and should be easier for HCPs to deploy. Alternatively, federated learning (a decentralized training approach) can also help ensure data privacy. LLMs show promise in delivering patient insights to clinicians more quickly. Addressing the aforementioned issues could enable their use in clinics, thereby benefiting patients as well as the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.

a terrorist group", "body": "TORONTO -- Canada has listed Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, after years of pressure from opposition legislators and some members of the Iranian diaspora.\n\nAnnouncing the decision on Wednesday, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc called it a \"significant tool in fighting global terrorism\".\n\nThe move will mean that thousands of senior Iranian government officials, including top IRGC officials, will be barred from entering Canada.\n\nThe IRGC is a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with close ties to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIt is estimated to have more than 190,000 active personnel with its own ground forces, navy and air force that oversee Iran's strategic weapons.\n\nThe IRGC exerts influence elsewhere in the Middle East by providing money, weapons, technology, training and advice to allied governments and armed groups through its shadowy overseas operations arm, the Quds (Jerusalem) Force, according to the government.\n\nThe Quds Force was already listed as a terrorist group by Canada, but Wednesday's announcement extends the designation to the entire IRGC.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, LeBlanc said the action \"sends a strong message that Canada will use all of the tools at its disposal to combat the terrorist entity of the IRGC\".\n\n\"The Iranian regime has consistently displayed disregard for human rights, both inside and outside of Iran as well as a willingness to destabilize the international rules-based order,\" he said.\n\nAfter this designation, current and former senior Iranian government officials already in Canada may also now be investigated and removed.\n\nCanada's foreign affairs minister, Melanie Joly, warned that Canadians in Iran could be at risk of arbitrary detention following the announcement.\n\n\"My message is clear: for those who are in Iran right now, it's time to come back home,\" she said.\n\n\"And for those who are planning to go to Iran, don't go.\"\n\nThe Canadian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had previously declined to extend the terrorism designation to the IRGC, despite pressure from some diaspora members -- including the families of those who died after Flight PS752 was shot down by the IRGC in January 2020 in Tehran.\n\nAll 175 passengers onboard the plane were killed, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents of Canada.\n\nTehran had claimed that the missile strike on the plane was done by mistake.\n\nTrudeau had previously said in 2022 that he feared a terrorism designation would unfairly target Iranians in Canada who opposed the regime and fled, but had to serve in the IRGC in the past.\n\nAsked why now by reporters, LeBlanc said the decision to designate a group as a terrorist entity is a \"deliberative process\" made on advice of security services and with foreign policy considerations.\n\n\"It is a threshold that must be met under the criminal code of Canada,\" he said.\n\nThe move makes Canada the second country in North America after the US to label the IRGC as a terrorist organization, which did so in 2019.\n\nThe UK had previously indicated its intent to make a similar move as recently as 2023, but has yet to do so. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title":

Its \"Quds Force\" is the wing primarily responsible for terrorist activity, including bombings that killed or injured hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq and Syria. The regime uses the IRGC generally, however, to maintain ties with terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Hamas, and other associates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration designated the IRGC a terrorist organization 2019 on the grounds that \"Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,\" according to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nCanada followed suit on Wednesday, stating through Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc that \"there are reasonable grounds to believe that the IRGC has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity.\"\n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani responded to the designation on Thursday, insisting that the IRGC is a legitimate entity as per the Iranian Islamic regime's Constitution and calling Canada's measure \"political, unconventional and ill-advised.\"\n\n\"Such irresponsible and provocative move follows the same wrong path that the Canadian government has been taking for over a decade under the influence of the group of warmongers,\" Kanaani said, \"true violators of human rights, and chief sponsors of terrorism.\"\n\nKanaani repeated the regime's claims that, rather than engage in terrorism, the IRGC fights terrorist entities, and he accused Ottawa of making a \"hostile move\" against Tehran.\n\nHe concluded, according to the IRGC-affiliated Tasnim News Agency, that Iran would consider an \"appropriate and retaliatory response\" to the measure. The outlet did not elaborate on what such a response may look like.\n\nLeBlanc, the Canadian public safety minister, said in his announcement Wednesday that the designation of the IRGC was necessary due to Iran's \"complete disregard for human rights, both inside and outside Iran, as well as a willingness to destabilize the international rules-based order.\"\n\n\"Listing the IRGC builds on the Government of Canada's broader efforts to ensure that there is no impunity for Iran's unlawful actions and its support of terrorism,\" LeBlanc asserted. \"Our government will always promote human rights and take action against those seeking to disrupt our way of life, here in Canada and around the world.\"\n\nIn addition to designating the IRGC, the Canadian government warned citizens in Iran to leave as soon as possible in anticipation of potential retribution.\n\nWhile many in the international community applauded the measures, conservatives in Canada recalled that radical leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not make any moves towards designating the IRGC for years, delaying the process despite support in the House of Commons.\n\n\"Trudeau and his Liberal government took six years to list the IRGC... As a result of that delay, the IRGC has been able to grow stronger as a result of Trudeau's inaction,\" lamented Conservative Party officials Michael Chong and Melissa Lantsman in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCalls for Canada to designate the IRGC increased significantly after the terrorist entity shot down a commercial airliner, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, in early 2020, killing 85 Canadian citizens and permanent residents out of the 176 passengers killed altogether. The flight had taken off from Tehran, on its way to Kyiv, shortly before the shootdown, which took place in the days immediately after President Trump ordered an airstrike to eliminate Qassem Soleimani, who was head of the Quds Force at the time. The IRGC reportedly shot down the plane by mistake, confusing it with an American missile.\n\nThe Iranian government blamed the United States for the incident and rapidly cleared the crash site of any incriminating evidence. Despite this, relatives of the innocents killed on the flight pursued legal action against the state of Iran and succeeded in overriding sovereign immunity in Canada. In January 2022, a Canadian court ruled that the Iranian state must pay $84 million in damages to the families, a ruling Tehran has ignored. In turn, the Iranian state has conducted legal proceedings against Trump and Pompeo under the Islamic law, sharia, for ordering an airstrike against Soleimani.\n\nIn July 2023, Canada joined several other states that lost citizens on the flight to sue Iran at the International Court of Justice over the incident, demanding an apology.\n\nThe Association of Families of Flight PS752 welcomed the announcement this week that Canada had declared the IRGC a terrorist group.\n\n\"It has been a long journey. Long and painful,\" board member Hamed Esmaeilion, who lost his wife and daughter on the flight, said. \"It's very important to punish those people or those organizations that were involved in atrocities against Canadians and Iranians.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances

Kanaani stated that this action by Canada would not impact the IRGC's \"legitimate and deterrent power,\" and that Tehran reserved the right to respond accordingly.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canada officially listed the IRGC as a terrorist group, a move that may lead to investigations into former senior Iranian officials residing in Canada. This follows a similar decision made by the US in 2019, accusing the IRGC of orchestrating a global terrorist campaign, a claim Tehran vehemently denies, maintaining that the IRGC is a national security institution.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc emphasized Canada's commitment to combating terrorism, stating, \"Canada will use all possible tools to combat terrorist activities carried out by the IRGC,\" citing \"very strong and compelling evidence.\" Opposition legislators had long advocated for this listing, but the Liberal government had previously hesitated, citing potential unintended consequences. LeBlanc noted that the decision was made based on legal advice and security services, not political pressure.\n\nThe IRGC, a dominant force in Iran, manages a vast business empire and elite military units, including the Quds Force, which Canada had already listed as a terrorist group. Canada severed diplomatic ties with Tehran in 2012. LeBlanc mentioned that current and former senior Iranian officials in Canada might face investigations and removal, although details were not provided. Designating a group as a terrorist organization allows for the freezing of assets and legal action against those who provide financial or material support.

The IRGC shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 above the skies of Tehran in January 2020, killing 175 passengers, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly warned that Canadians in Iran might face a heightened risk of arbitrary detention after Wednesday's announcement.\n\n\"For those who are in Iran right now, it's time to come back home. And for those who are planning to go to Iran, don't go,\" Joly said.\n\nThis latest development comes after years of pressure on the federal government to list the IRGC.\n\nThe association representing family members of Flight PS752 victims, members of the Iranian Canadian community, the Conservative Party and the NDP have all called on the government to designate the entire militia group as a terrorist entity. MPs voted unanimously last month to do so.\n\nHamed Esmaeilion, a board member with the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims, said the families are \"happy to hear\" the government is moving forward with this designation after they demanded it at every rally and event they held over the past four years.\n\n\"It has been a long journey. Long and painful,\" said Esmaeilon, who lost his daughter and wife on Flight PS752. \"It's very important to punish those people or those organizations that were involved in atrocities against Canadians and Iranians.\n\nConservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said his party has been calling on the government to list the IRGC as a terrorist organization for six years, ever since the House of Commons first adopted a Conservative opposition motion to do so in 2018.\n\n\"Because of the government's inaction over the last six years, the Iranian regime's capabilities here in North American have only increased,\" Chong said Wednesday. \"The government is only taking action now because of recent reports outlining that increased capacity by the Iranian regime.\"\n\nNDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson called the move a \"good step,\" adding that \"it should not have taken this long.\"\n\nWhen asked why it took the government so long to make the move, LeBlanc said the decision was made based on the advice of security services and foreign policy considerations.\n\n\"The decision to list an organization under Canada's Criminal Code as a terrorist entity isn't made because of comments on Twitter or question period,\" he said.\n\nLeBlanc added that Canada's security services hold a monthly review to determine whether to recommend that various entities be listed as terrorist entities under the Criminal Code.\n\n\"The government of Canada has concluded after a deliberative process, based on very, very strong and compelling evidence that the cabinet received, that now is the time,\" he added.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in Iran; it cut diplomatic ties with the country in 2012.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre renewed his calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to list the IRGC as a terrorist entity after Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, according to Israeli government estimates.\n\nHamas, which is listed as a terrorist organization, is also a member of a Tehran-backed alliance of militant groups in the Middle East known as the \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\nThe government's news release cited the IRGC's \"known association\" with Hamas and Hezbollah, another listed terrorist group.\n\n\"Based on their actions, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the IRGC has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity, or has knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with an entity that has knowingly carried out terrorist activity,\" the news release said.\n\nIsrael's Ambassador to Canada Iddo Moed welcomed the new designation.\n\n\"We appreciate the decision of the Government of Canada and at the same time recognize the importance of the broad and long standing cross-party parliamentary support in this regard,\" he said in a news release.\n\nAfter years of reluctance by the government, Trudeau told victims' families at a ceremony on the fourth anniversary of the destruction of the plane that his government was looking at ways to \"responsibly\" move forward with that designation.\n\n\"We know there is more to do to hold the regime to account and we will continue our work, including continuing to look for ways to responsibly list the IRGC as a terrorist organization,\" the prime minister said on Jan. 8.\n\nThat comment came after the government explained for years why it hadn't listed the IRGC.\n\nIn 2022, the government said that including the militia group on the terrorist list could unfairly affect Iranians in Canada who opposed the regime and fled, but had to serve with the IRGC in the past as part of mandatory military service. Then-justice minister David Lametti said designating the IRGC as a terrorist entity could be too much of \"a blunt instrument.\"\n\nInstead, the government opted to take action that year through immigration laws by designating the Islamic Republic of Iran as a \"regime that has engaged in terrorism and systematic and gross human rights violations\" under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n\nOn Wednesday, Lametti's successor, Justice Minister Arif Virani, said the government remains concerned about the impact of the listing on those conscripted into the IRGC, but is being \"careful and measured\" in its approach.\n\n\"If an individual was conscripted at one point in time and no longer serves with the IRGC, that would affect the analysis,\" he said.\n\nThe government has also argued it already listed the Quds Force -- a branch of the IRGC -- as a terrorist organization. But the victims' families said that wasn't enough because the Quds Force was not the branch responsible for shooting down Flight PS752.\n\nAt a media conference earlier this week, Iranian Canadian human rights activist Nazanin Afshin-Jam MacKay, speaking for Iran's Justice Collective, called on the government to act. She said IRGC regime officials and affiliates are living in Canada and buying up expensive properties, and they pose a risk.\n\n\"For us, it's extremely important to list them on the terrorist list, not just because of what they do to Iranians but the security risks they pose to all Canadians,\" she said at the Tuesday media conference about an NDP motion targeting Iran.\n\nThe Canada Border Services Agency said last year it had denied entry to dozens of senior Iranian regime officials trying to enter Canada and was investigating about 100 more with status in Canada.\n\nThe U.S. listed Iran as a terrorist organization in 2019, when Donald Trump was president.", "source": {"uri": "kmaupdates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kmaupdates.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Britain has resisted a parallel move. The foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said there is no demand for the move from the UK security services and it would almost inevitably lead to Iran cutting off all diplomatic ties with Britain.\n\nLabour, which is ahead in the polls before the UK's 4 July election, has said it would proscribe the IRGC, a move that had strong cross-party support in the previous parliament, but the proposal was not included in its recent manifesto, which may indicate that the party is aware there are competing views in the intelligence services.\n\nLord Cameron has said he would prefer to deal with Iranian leaders directly and not through third parties as the US is required to do by using the Swiss embassy in Tehran as its conduit.\n\nCanada has a large and politically active Iranian diaspora, in part because it has been generous in providing visas to dissident fleeing the regime, and the diaspora has been pressing for the move for years.\n\nIn January 2020 the IRGC shot down Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shortly after it left Tehran airport for Kyiv, killing 176 people including many with strong ties to Canada, and in Canada the IRGC has been accused of foreign interference, seeking to threaten and intimidate members of the Iranian diaspora and of wanting to carry out cyber-attacks.\n\nIran has said the Ukrainian plane was mistaken for a missile at a time of heightened tension between the west and Iran.\n\nCanada had previously included the Quds force, the IRGC's clandestine foreign intelligence and paramilitary wing, on its terror group list. In October 2022 it banned the entry of senior IRGC leaders into Canada and promised to impose sanctions on them. Ottawa severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 2010.\n\nAn Iranian activist, Nazanin Afshin-Jam, told MPs this month as they debated the listing: \"If we do not do something now, their terror will spread like cancer and cost us even more - politically through foreign interference, economically through cyberwarfare and money laundering, and in lives through terrorism here in Canada.\"\n\nThe Canadian decision comes in the midst of a convulsive presidential election campaign in Iran, after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, in which the impact of Iran's difficult relations with the rest of the world on its weak domestic economy is a central issue.\n\nIn response to Canada's decision, Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, highlighted the IRGC role in fighting Islamic State and said Ottawa would be held responsible for its actions.\n\nThe Canadian public safety minister, Dominic LeBlanc, did not give a specific single reason why the decision had finally been taken after so much discussion, but denied it had been because of political pressure.\n\nA letter in December 2023, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Justin Trudeau's government to list the IRGC as a terrorist group, arguing it had played a role supporting Hamas before and after the group's 7 October assault on Israel that sparked the current Gaza war.\n\nThe designation means that if a financial institution such as a bank has an account in the name of someone who has been publicly identified as a member of the IRGC, it will freeze, seize and restrain that account or property.",

List IRGC As 'Terrorist Group,' Vows Response", "body": "Canada designates IRGC as \u00e2\u20ac~terrorist group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 under country's Criminal Code.\n\nIran has condemned Canada's decision to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a \"terrorist group,\" describing the move as \"irresponsible and provocative.\"\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said the move by the Canadian government will have \"no effect\" on the IRGC's \"legitimate and deterrent power.\"\n\nHe said Iran \"reserves the right to respond appropriately and reciprocally,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"This irresponsible and provocative move is in line with the wrong path that the Canadian government has been following for more than a decade under the influence of war-mongers, real human rights violators, and the main sponsors of terrorism,\" Kanaani said.\n\nCanada on Wednesday listed the Iranian elite military force as a \"terrorist group\" under the country's Criminal Code.\n\nA statement issued by Ottawa noted that there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that it has \"knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated a terrorist activity or has knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with an entity that has knowingly carried out terrorist activity.\"\n\nThe Canadian government said it will \"use all tools at its disposal to combat the terrorist activity of the IRGC.\"\n\nActing Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani also denounced the Canadian move as \"a malicious provocation that violates the principles and rules of international law and is just a gift to the 'genocidal' regime.\"\n\nThe \"Canadian government will be responsible for the consequences of this provocative and irresponsible decision,\" he added on his X account.\n\nAs a result of the designation of the IRGC, Canadian financial institutions are required to immediately freeze the military force's properties, and Canadian nationals are also not allowed to cooperate with it.\n\nImmediately after the announcement was made on Wednesday, Iran's top human rights official and deputy judiciary chief, Kazem Gharibabadi, termed the move as a \"hostile action\" and said it was \"contrary to the principles of international law.\"\n\n\"It is a bitter irony that a country which itself is a major violator of human rights and a supporter of terrorism has placed the IRGC, which is responsible for national security and counter-terrorism in the region, on its self-proclaimed terrorist list,\" the official said.\n\nWhile the IRGC is designated as a \"foreign terrorist group\" by the US, other countries have so far been hesitant to push ahead with the move due to legal issues.\n\nIn January last year, the Iranian Parliament warned of a \"decisive and prompt\" response after the European Parliament moved to designate the IRGC.\n\nIt came after European lawmakers overwhelmingly voted for a resolution that called for \"the EU and its member states to include the IRGC on the EU's terrorist list.\"\n\nIran has maintained that designating the elite force as a terrorist entity is an \"illegal\" move as it is the official military branch of the Iranian government.\n\nExperts believe that the move by the Canadian government is likely to escalate tensions between the two countries.

Britain has resisted a parallel move. The foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said there is no demand for the move from the UK security services and it would almost inevitably lead to Iran cutting off all diplomatic ties with Britain.\n\nLabour, which is ahead in the polls before the UK's 4 July election, has said it would proscribe the IRGC, a move that had strong cross-party support in the previous parliament, but the proposal was not included in its recent manifesto, which may signal that the party is aware there are competing views in the intelligence services.\n\nLord Cameron has said he would prefer to deal with Iranian leaders directly and not through third parties as the US is required to do by using the Swiss embassy in Tehran as its conduit.\n\nCanada has a large and politically active Iranian diaspora, in part because it has been generous in providing visas to dissident fleeing the regime, and the diaspora has been pressing for the move for years.\n\nIn January 2020 the IRGC shot down Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shortly after it left Tehran airport for Kyiv, killing 176 people including many with strong ties to Canada, and in Canada the IRGC has been accused of foreign interference, seeking to threaten and intimidate members of the Iranian diaspora and of wanting to carry out cyber-attacks.\n\nIran has said the Ukrainian plane was mistaken for a missile at a time of heightened tension between the west and Iran.\n\nCanada had previously included the Quds force, the IRGC's clandestine foreign intelligence and paramilitary wing, on its terror group list. In October 2022 it banned the entry of senior IRGC leaders into Canada and promised to impose sanctions on them. Ottawa severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 2010.\n\nAn Iranian activist, Nazanin Afshin-Jam, told MPs this month as they debated the listing: \"If we do not do something now, their terror will spread like cancer and cost us even more - politically through foreign interference, economically through cyberwarfare and money laundering, and in lives through terrorism here in Canada.\"\n\nThe Canadian move comes in the midst of a convulsive presidential election campaign in Iran, after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, in which the impact of Iran's difficult relations with the rest of the world on its weak domestic economy is a central issue.\n\nIn response to the move, Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, highlighted the IRGC role in fighting Islamic State and said Canada would be held responsible for its actions.\n\nThe Canadian public safety minister, Dominic LeBlanc, did not give a specific single reason why the decision had finally been taken after so much discussion, but denied it had been due to political pressure.\n\nA letter in December 2023 from a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged Justin Trudeau's government to list the IRGC as a terrorist group, arguing it had played a role supporting Hamas before and after the group's 7 October assault on Israel that sparked the current Gaza war.\n\nThe designation means that if a financial institution such as a bank has an account in the name of someone who has been publicly identified as a member of the IRGC, it will freeze, seize and restrain that account or property.", "source":

The move comes after years of pressure from Canada's parliament, opposition, and Iranian diaspora, which have repeatedly highlighted the IRGC's longstanding role in fomenting international terrorism, including against Canadians. The move follows last month's unanimous passage by Canada's House of Commons of a motion calling on the government to make the designation.\n\n\"As an immediate consequence of this listing, Canadian financial institutions, such as banks and brokerages, are required to immediately freeze the property of a listed entity,\" the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. \"It is a criminal offence for anyone in Canada and Canadians abroad to knowingly deal with property owned or controlled by a terrorist group.\"\n\n\"Now let's see if the Canadian government actually enforces the law and cracks down on IRGC members tormenting Iranian-Canadians, as well as on the IRGC-linked assets that have long found a safe haven in Canada's economy.\" -- Mark Dubowitz, FDD CEO\n\n\"This designation is welcome but long overdue. It should not have taken Prime Minister Trudeau so many years to recognize the obvious: The IRGC is a terrorist organization that Ottawa must punish using every tool at its disposal.\" -- Tzvi Kahn, FDD Research Fellow and Senior Editor\n\nIn January 2020, the IRGC shot down Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752, killing all 176 passengers -- including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents. Ontario judge Edward Belobaba later ruled that \"the shooting down of Flight 752\" by the IRGC \"was an act of terrorism.\" He said the IRGC \"knew Flight PS 752 was a civilian airplane and purposefully shot it down with the intent to destroy it.\"\n\nThe victims' families repeatedly pressed Ottawa to hold the IRGC accountable, but the Trudeau government took only limited action until now. In November 2022, Ottawa designated the Islamic Republic of Iran pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \"as a regime that has engaged in terrorism and systematic and gross human rights violations.\" The designation barred more than 10,000 Iranian officials, including IRGC personnel, from entering Canada.\n\nThe United States designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization in 2019. \"We're doing [this] because the Iranian regime's use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government,\" then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. \"This historic step will deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world.\"\n\nIn December 2023, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Reps. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) and Jared Moskowitz (D-FL), sent a letter to Trudeau urging him to designate the IRGC. \"It is vital that Canada recognizes the threat posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran and takes all appropriate steps to address it,\" the lawmakers said. In May 2023, another bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Reps. Tenney and Brad Schneider (D-IL), sent a similar letter to Trudeau.\n\nThe European Union (EU) has not designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization. In 2023, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution calling on the EU to make the designation, but EU leaders thus far have refused.\n\nWhile the IRGC's role in international terrorism dates back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the case for designation significantly grew following the October 7, 2023, atrocities in Israel carried out by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists. The IRGC has trained, armed, and funded Hamas, making the IRGC complicit in the October 7 attack. The IRGC has also trained, armed, and funded Hezbollah, its proxy terrorist group in Lebanon, which has killed more than 20 Israeli soldiers in cross-border attacks in the wake of October 7. The IRGC has similarly trained, funded, and armed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have conducted more than 50 strikes against commercial shipping in the Red Sea since November.\n\nThe IRGC fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel directly from Iranian territory in April. The air defense systems of Israel and allied nations shot down 99 percent of them.\n\n\"October 7 attacks strengthen case for designating IRGC as a terrorist organization,\" by Tzvi Kahn\n\n\"Canada's

Earlier this week, the US signalled that it would back Israel in a potential offensive against the Lebanese group, which is backed by Iran.\n\nThe IRGC was formed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran and is part of the Islamic Republic's official military structure.\n\nLeBlanc added that the designation could allow Canada to investigate any former Iranian government officials living in the country.\n\nUnder Canadian law, once a group is designated as a terrorist entity, police are allowed to charge or go after anyone who supports the group.\n\nThe move could also potentially affect Iranians who have sought refuge in Canada, given that some have previously served in the IRGC as a part of Iran's mandatory military service.\n\nSeveral countries in Europe, including Germany, are also pushing the European Union to designate the IRGC as a terrorist group.\n\nIran and Canada have had tense relations over the past decade. Eight years after Ottawa cut diplomatic ties, in 2020 Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane that had dozens of Canadian citizens and residents on board.\n\nThe strike came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US, which had just killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nIran said the downing of the plane was an accident spurred by human error, and last year a court in Iran issued initial sentences for 10 unnamed people accused of playing a role in the downing.\n\nBut in a case at the International Court of Justice, Canada said Iran had failed \"to conduct an impartial, transparent and fair criminal investigation and prosecution consistent with international law\".", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

Global Affairs said that since registration is voluntary, this figure might underestimate the actual number of Canadians there.\n\nThe department is recommending that people leave Iran on commercial flights if it's safe to do so.\n\nCanada severed diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012. Joly warned that the government cannot offer Canadians at risk in Iran the same level of support they could access in countries where Canada has embassies.\n\n\"We do not have an embassy in Iran,\" said Joly. \"We've cut diplomatic ties for years now, and therefore, we won't be able to provide the consular expertise that would be required.\"\n\nDennis Horak was Canada's head of mission in Iran from 2009 to 2012, when the embassy closed. He said Iran has a \"very active ... cyber army\" which monitors social media and online activity, including email; he said Tehran may decide to \"step that up.\"\n\nWhen he was in Iran, he said, he and his colleagues operated on the \"full assumption\" that their phones were tapped, and embassy staff were followed from time to time.\n\nTehran could take retaliatory measures against individuals to send a message to other countries not to follow Canada's lead, Horak said. The U.S. has already listed the IRGC as a terrorist entity. The U.K. has signaled it plans do so and there's a push underway for EU countries to list the IRGC as well.\n\nHorak said he doesn't think Iran is \"overly bothered by\" the terrorism listing because it's mostly a \"symbolic gesture.\" But he warned that Iran could still try to send the international community a signal through arbitrary arrests.\n\n\"The big concern is arbitrary detention,\" Horak said. \"We've seen this in the past with the Canadian dual nationals and that's always a risk. Iran has a habit of doing this ... to try and send a message.\"\n\nHamed Esmaeilion is a prominent Canadian critic of Iran's regime; his wife Parisa and nine-year-old daughter Reera died on Flight PS752. The IRGC shot down the plane in 2020 over the skies of Tehran.\n\nEsmaeilion said his family members in Iran have been harassed and intimidated by Iran's intelligence ministry through repeated phone calls.\n\nHis parents, who are permanent residents of Canada, have also been banned by Iran's regime from leaving the country, he said. His mother was stopped at the airport in December 2023 and was told she couldn't leave.\n\n\"I can go back, but there's no way to leave Iran after that,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by CBC News about the risk of Iran retaliating on Canadian soil, the RCMP said it would be \"inappropriate for us to speculate.\"\n\n\"Through established networks, the RCMP in collaboration with police of jurisdiction across Canada are engaging with the various diaspora communities to increase their awareness on these criminal behaviours and encourage them to report these crimes,\" RCMP spokesperson Robin Percival told CBC News in a media statement.\n\nIranian-Canadians have reported being monitored, threatened and followed on Canadian soil by those they believe are agents of the Iranian regime. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service also warned in 2022 that it was investigating \"credible\" death threats from Iran against individuals in Canada.\n\nEsmaeilion is among those who have reported suspicious activity to authorities. He said he believes his Toronto-area home is being monitored. He said that when his mother was visiting him last year, someone posted the information online when she flew back to Iran.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"},

It was brought down by two Iranian surface-to-air missiles launched by the IRGC.\n\nAll 176 people onboard, including 55 Canadian citizens -- nine from Winnipeg's Iranian community -- were killed.\n\n\"This by itself was a war crime and a crime against humanity. They were innocent passengers in a civilian airline,\" said Doustshenas, who is a real estate agent in Winnipeg.\n\n\"Our loved ones would have been alive today if they would have not been a target of the IRGC.\"\n\nThe federal government made the announcement Wednesday afternoon after years of mounting pressure.\n\nOnce a group is placed on the country's terror list, police can charge anyone who financially or materially supports the group and banks can freeze its assets.\n\nThe government's news release cited the IRGC's \"known association\" with Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which are on Canada's terrorist list. A Tehran-backed alliance of militant groups in the Middle East, which includes Hamas and Hezbollah, has been called the \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\nThe IRGC was created following the 1979 Iranian Revolution specifically to protect the new government.\n\n\"This is not a national army of any kind. They have been supporting the terrorist organizations of all kinds ... financially and also with supplying arms,\" Doustshenas said.\n\n\"They're trying to destabilize the whole region and also they're trying to influence the democratic discourse in Canada by suppressing and intimidating the Canadian voices from the Iranian diaspora.\"\n\nArian Arianpour, president of the Iranian Community of Manitoba, agreed.\n\n\"Their evilness has never had any limits. They are involved with executions, with murders, with torture, with systemic rape,\" he said.\n\nAmini was arrested in Iran's capital for \"improper attire\" after she allegedly did not wear a hijab properly. The 22-year-old died in police custody three days later.\n\nIranian police said the cause of death was a heart attack, which caused Amini to fall into a coma before being brought to a hospital. Other women detained with her alleged she suffered police brutality.\n\nHe cited the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which sparked a widespread anti-Iranian government protest movement.\n\nAmini was arrested in Tehran by Iran's morality police for \"improper attire\" after she allegedly violated the theocracy's mandatory headscarf law. The 22-year-old died in police custody three days later.\n\n\"The Iranian diaspora all over the world and Iranian people inside the country are relieved by this decision [by Canada],\" Arianpour said.\n\n\"Now that we have this designation, we are awaiting more targeted sanctions and more support from not only the people of the world, but the governments of the world.\"\n\nIt's a single battle victory in a larger war, he said.\n\n\"The people of Iran are not backing down until they get rid of this regime, because there is no future in Iran if the Islamic Republic is still in power,\" Arianpour said.\n\n\"It is upon all of us to help the people of Iran, because it is not only their human rights. We should not forget that the Islamic Republic regime and IRGC are terrorizing people not only inside Iran, but in the Middle East, in Africa, in Latin America and recently in Canada.\"", "source":

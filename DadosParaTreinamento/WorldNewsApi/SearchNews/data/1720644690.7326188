{"id": 231293436, "title": "Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, Israeli hostages rescued", "text": "The group of hostages freed from Gaza on Saturday includes a student, security guards and a recent immigrant to Israel. All four were at the Nova music festival on October 7 near the Israel-Gaza border when they were taken captive by Hamas on what many consider to be one of the darkest days in Israel's history. Here's what to know about each of them, according to a hostage campaign group, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum: Almog Meir Jan is a 22-year-old from the small city of Or Yehuda, outside Tel Aviv. Meir Jan had been due to start a new job at a technology company on October 8, the day after the Hamas attacks. The advocacy group described him as a \"polite\" and \"helpful\" young man with a \"wide warm smile.\" Shlomi Ziv is a 41-year-old who was working as a security guard at the music festival when he was kidnapped. Ziv had lived in the local moshav, or agricultural settlement, for 17 years with his wife Miren. The group described him as a \"big brother\"-type figure who is \"always the first to help\" those in need. Andrey Kozlov is a 27-year-old resident of Rishon LeZion, a city about 5 miles south of Tel Aviv. He was also working as a security guard at the Nova festival on October 7. He is a Russian citizen who immigrated to Israel one year ago. Back in January, senior Russian diplomat Mikhail Bogdanov called for the release of Kozlov and two other Russian citizens also being held by Hamas. Noa Argamani is a 25-year-old who had been studying information systems management at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. She quickly became a symbol of the October 7 attacks after video surfaced of her being kidnapped by Hamas fighters on a motorbike. Argamani's boyfriend, Avinatan Or, was also kidnapped from the festival and remains in Hamas captivity. According to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, Argamani is a yoga and art enthusiast who enjoys hiking in her spare time.", "summary": "The Israeli military says it rescued four hostages in a military operation in central Gaza.

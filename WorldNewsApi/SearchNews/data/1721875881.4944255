In 2011, they banned using phones in schools. But kids being kids, the ban was ignored more often than not. And media have changed significantly since then, phones becoming practically appendages, with kids\u2019 eyeballs glued to TikTok and other social media apps. The board meeting is on YouTube, so, ironically, you have to use social media to watch it. The cell ban is discussed in the first hour under the title, \u201cSupporting Student Mental Health and Learning by Ensuring a Phone-Free School Day,\u201d item number 23, starting at the 38-minute mark. The Agenda also describes much of what would be discussed.

Murthy published the day before, in which Dr. Vivek called for putting cigarette-like warning labels on social media sites and apps.However, unlike cigarettes, cell phone content largely is protected by the First Amendment.Learning LossThe meeting then moved on to phone testimony from Dr. Kara Anderson, a pediatrician. She said students already have been suffering from \u201cpost-pandemic learning loss.\u201d And cell phones add to the problem. Gov. Gavin Newsom is also supporting the cell phone ban in schools. Shortly after Mr. Murthy\u2019s op-ed appeared, the governor said in a statement, \u201cAs the surgeon general affirmed, social media is harming the mental health of our youth. Building on legislation I signed in 2019, I look forward to working with the Legislature to restrict the use of smartphones during the school day. When children and teens are in school, they should be focused on their studies\u2014not their screens.\u201d Some LAUSD schools already have enacted bans. Westside Global Awareness Magnet School stipulates on its website: \u201cCell phones will be collected during Home-Room class and stored in a secure locker. The lockers will be kept in the Principal\u2019s office. Phones will be returned to students at the end of Period 6 (before they go home).\u201d Mervyn Dymally High School maintains: \u201cCell Phones are not permitted to be used on campus during the school day. Cell phones and all electronics must be in the Yonder Pouch. Confiscated cell phones, can be picked up Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday by a parent only.\u201d A Yondr Pouch\u2014the school misspelled it\u2014prevents students from accessing their phones and can only be unlocked outside the phone-free area. A 2022 study in the journal Applied Economic Analysis looked at two governments in Spain banning cell phones in schools. \u201cThe results show noticeable reductions of bullying incidence among teenagers in the two treated regions,\u201d it found. \u201cThe authors also find positive and significant effects of this policy on the PISA scores of the Galicia region that are equivalent to 0.6\u20130.8\u2009years of learning in maths and around 0.72 to near one\u2009year of learning in sciences.\u201d PISA tests are an international comparison of student abilities. And a 2016 study of schools in four English cities in the journal Labour Economics concluded, \u201cWe find that student performance in high stakes exams significantly increases post ban, by about 0.07 standard deviations on average. These increases in performance are driven by the lowest-achieving students. This suggests that the unstructured presence of phones has detrimental effects on certain students and restricting their use can be a low-cost policy to reduce educational inequalities.\u201dThe AI ChallengeThe LAUSD ban on cell phones in schools inevitably will be followed by bans in other districts. And Mr. Newsom likely will succeed in a statewide ban.

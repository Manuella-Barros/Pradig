Deer Park Fire Department Assistant Chief Dominic Albanese explained at a press conference that the incident happened shortly before 5 p.m. at the Hawaii Nail & Spa, which is part of a strip mall. \"Upon arrival, we immediately identified this as a mass casualty incident. We transported nine patients to area hospitals, one by aviation,\" Albanese said. \"There were four patients who were deceased upon arrival. We had nine departments total respond and eight ambulance companies, and we had about 150 firefighters and EMS personnel on scene to handle this incident.\" The fire chief said that it appeared the minivan driver \u2014 who was \"partially conscious\" when officials arrived on the scene and later transported to the hospital \u2014 drove \"all the way through the building.\" \"Almost all of the way to the back of the salon, the vehicle traveled,\" he later emphasized. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by Suffolk County Police Department major case unit detectives, per the Associated Press. PEOPLE has reached out to the department for comment. Witnesses told WABC-TV that before the incident, the minivan \"raced\" through the parking lot, seemingly in an effort to leave the area. It reportedly then went around another car that was stopped at a traffic light and crashed into the salon while trying to turn onto the street. Albanese said that it appeared that the people who were killed were inside the building at the time of the crash and noted that some individuals had to be \"extricated\" before also being taken to local hospitals. \"This was very difficult for all the firefighters and EMS personnel on the scene, and we will be meeting with the crisis team this evening for anybody that needs it [and] for all departments involved,\" Albanese said. While the identity of the driver or the victims has yet to be released, Albanese said that the incident is a \"horrible\" situation.

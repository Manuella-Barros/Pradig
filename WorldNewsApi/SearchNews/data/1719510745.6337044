[+] the Los Angeles Convention Center on June 11, 2013. Getty Images Since the dawn of the computer, adventure games have been an important part of the evolution of the machine. Titles like Zork, King\u2019s Quest and Maniac Mansion showed people that computers could be fun. These titles told stories just as dramatic as any novel, or comedic as any Hollywood movie. These games changed as the video game industry evolved but they never really went away. This article contains a mix of timeless experiences and modern classics in the greatest adventure games. What Is An Adventure Game? Adventure games tell a story by challenging the player to explore their environment, interact with other characters and solve puzzles. While these games may have some elements of role playing games or open world environments, the stories remain fairly linear compared to those genres. The story usually remains the same regardless of player action and side quests rarely expand beyond finding collectible elements in the environment. Colossal Cave Adventure, released in 1976, is considered the first entry in the genre. Early games often used a text parser for input using simple sentences like \u201ceat food\u201d or \u201cgo west\u201d to describe action. Some of the best adventure games came from companies like Sierra On-Line and Lucasarts who developed the \u201cpoint and click\u201d style of game. Top Adventure Games The games chosen for this list have been selected as excellent examples in each category. Please note that in the modern era, many of these games are available on multiple platforms, so anyone looking to try them shouldn\u2019t disqualify them if they don\u2019t possess the platform the game is listed under. 15. Gabriel Knight: Sins Of The Fathers Sierra On-Line was best known for family friendly stories like King\u2019s Quest but Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers took the genre in a gloriously 90s direction full of voodoo murders, secret monster hunting bloodlines and gorgeous painted artwork. The 20th anniversary edition features an updated interface for modern gamers but for those who can handle old school, the original features some amazing voice work from Mark Hamill and Tim Curry as the titular hero.

This game is the best choice for fans of the Cthulhu Mythos. 13. God Of War: Ragnarok Sony also brought God of War forward to the Playstation 4 in 2018. Earlier titles focused more on action than adventure, but the shift to a new console allowed for a more character centric story from developer Santa Monica Studio. Kratos continues to battle gods, this time from Norse mythology, but he also must come to terms with being a father and raising his son, Atreus. 12. Life Is Strange Dontnod Entertainment recently released a remaster of Life Is Strange.

The grown up fairy tables setting compels fans of fantasy and hard boiled noir. 10.

Stray Stray became an unexpected hit for early Playstation 5 owners in 2022. BlueTwelve studio combined two unlikely ideas that work surprisingly well together; explore a run down cyberpunk city as a cat through jumping puzzles and an unusual narrative in the background. Plus, there\u2019s a meow button which never ceases to amuse. 8. Control Remedy Entertainment brought Control to consoles in 2019 and upgraded the game in 2021. This surreal game features the Federal Bureau of Control, a secret government agency tasked with invetigating strange phenomena. Don\u2019t expect the usual ghosts and vampires, however; this game has much bigger ambitions and much stranger creatures for the main character to slay. 7. The Last Of Us The Last Of Us also began as a Naughty Dog Playstation game in 2014. The two titles in this series tell the story of survivors making their way across a post-apocalyptic landscape with a human who might just offer a cure for the infection that turns people into monsters.

Return To Monkey Island Return to Monkey Island offers a modern take on the genre. Terrible Toybox brought back series creator Ron Gilbert for more comedic adventures with hapless pirate Guybrush Threepwood. For fans that played the originals it offers a great run through franchise history. For new players, the game shows off why it has such a legendary reputation. 5. The Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom The Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom is one of the reasons to pickup a Switch in the first place. The Zelda games tell the same story in each generation. Link searches for Zelda while trying to stop Ganondorf from taking control of Hyrule. The Switch editions have shifted to more of an open-world style gameplay but the classic story underneath remains the same. 4. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Naughty Dog collects the two most recent Uncharted titles with Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves.

Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis We can\u2019t talk about the best adventures games without discussing Indiana Jones And The Fate Of Atlantis. This Lucasarts classic offers three paths through the story; using Indy\u2019s fists, using Indy\u2019s wits and teaming up with sassy redhead Sophia Hapgood to find the lost city. It\u2019s also one of the funniest games on this list thanks to Indy\u2019s weary lines directly to the player. 2.

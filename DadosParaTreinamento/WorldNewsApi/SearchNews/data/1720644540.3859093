Letby, 34, was found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six more while working as a nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital\u2019s neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. She was given a whole life sentence in August 2023 following a ten-month trial. Letby is due to face a retrial at Manchester Crown Court this month on one charge of attempting to murder a baby girl in February 2016. Now, Bodyguard creator Mercurio, 58, is set to create a televised drama about the neonatal nurse, with Killing Eve star Jodie Comer and Game Of Thrones\u2019 Sophie Turner both tipped for the lead role. According to The Sun, the director will be working alongside hospital consultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram on the show, who was a whistle-blower in the Letby case. \u2018Jed sees this as an important story that should not just be chronicled in a drama but also explored,\u2019 a source told the publication.

Letby lodged an application to challenge all the counts in September, which was denied last month.

Also in September, Nick Johnson KC, for the prosecution, told Manchester Crown Court that a decision had been made to pursue a retrial in the case of Baby K, a girl born in February 2016. The prosecution is not pursuing a retrial on the five other charges of attempted murder, relating to four babies \u2013 two girls, Baby H and Baby J, and two boys, Baby N and Baby Q \u2013 after the jury in Letby\u2019s trial was unable to reach verdicts. Cheshire Constabulary is continuing to review all units where Letby worked, and said in a statement to BBC: \u2018During the course of the review if anything of concern medically is identified then the relevant family would be contacted by the investigation team as part of the process.\u2019 Got a story?

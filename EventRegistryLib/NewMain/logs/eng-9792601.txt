There is a hurricane hitting Florida right now, and while I'm not sure how that is impacting Miami specifically, the entire state is getting at least rained on right now. With that in consideration, know this bet could be voided due to the game being called. If that's the case, I apologize, but I liked something about this game between the Reds and Marlins and thought it would be a good one to share.\n\nThe Reds are not out of playoff contention, but it isn't likely to happen. I think you can probably describe it like someone telling you \"Maybe\" when you request something. Sure, in theory, the possibility is there, but you know it isn't likely to happen even if the door has been left open a crack. If I am a Reds fan, I have a few reasons to view this season positively. They don't really have any dominant starting pitcher and their offense has been rough all season, but they still are just five games below .500. Tonight's opponent can be described similarly and they are 28 games below .500. The other thing about the Reds is that you can point to a specific stretch of baseball that really hurt them. From April 25th to May 23rd, they lost 20 baseball games, going 6-20 over that span. If you take that out of their record, they are 47-38, nine games above. You obviously can't just throw games out, but that large sample indicates the team should probably have gone 14-12 instead of 6-20. Regardless, the results are what they are. Tonight's starter is Nick Martinez. Martinez comes into the game making his sixth start of the season for the Reds. Over the season he has a 3.65 ERA and a 1.13 WHIP. If he can keep these numbers as a starter, he will be a valuable rotation piece for the Reds. He has been better on the road for the club than he has at home, but he has made just one road start this season, so we will have to see if his relief appearances and starting splits matchup. He has faced the Marlins twice this season, going a total of four innings, allowing four hits and no walks or runs.\n\nThe Marlins are not White Sox-bad, but they are pretty bad. They threw in the towel early on the season as they traded away their best hitter. Then later on in the year, they had Josh Bell playing very well for the club and they decided that it didn't make sense to have a player doing good things on their roster so they traded him away too. He was placed on waivers first, and then traded for a player-to-be-named later or cash, so clearly you can tell what the Marlins priorities are. There needs to be a rule in all sports that if your team loses for a set number of years, or is under payroll or something for a set number of years the team needs to be put for sale immediately. I understand the Marlins made the playoffs last season, and this is the cycle they go through, but can they at least pretend to try and field a sustainable winning team? Tonight, they put Roddery Munoz on the hill with his 2-5 record, 5.45 ERA, and 1.38 WHIP. In July, Munoz tossed 25 innings and allowed 15 earned runs. Almost half of them came in one game against the Orioles, and three games had him under three earned runs allowed, so there is some promise there. He hasn't faced anyone on the Reds, so he could have an opportunity to at least make the game a little tough on them to start. Batters are hitting just .227 against him the first time through the lineup.\n\nThis is the case of a game where neither team truly benefits from winning. The Reds were somewhat sellers at the deadline, and the Marlins gave up a long time ago. However, I think the Marlins actually have a good chance to win this game - I will say this goes against how the line is moving, but Martinez doesn't pitch deep into games. The Reds have a strong bullpen, but so do the Marlins, surprisingly. I'll back the fish to steal one from the Reds here to start the series.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bell_(first_baseman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Bell (first baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/Miami-Marlins-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-25", "dateEnd": "-05-23", "textStart": 1218, "textEnd": 1240}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Odds and Insights with Carlos SME - Sports Talk Florida", "body": "As the Marlins gear up to face the Reds in an exciting four-game series starting tonight at loanDepot park, there's a lot to analyze. Let's delve into some insights that might help you make informed betting decisions.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds have had a challenging run lately. With a current record of 53-58, they've lost three of their last four games. Despite this, their season has been somewhat of a roller coaster, showcasing moments of brilliance alongside bouts of inconsistency. Their most recent series against San Francisco saw them lose two out of three games, blowing a 2-0 lead on Sunday. Prior to this, they managed to secure victories against the Cubs and Braves but fell short against the Rays. A record of 3-5 in their last eight games doesn't exactly scream stability, but it's evident that the Reds have potential.\n\nOn the mound, Cincinnati sports a 3.91 ERA, a 1.25 WHIP, and holds their opponents to a .237 batting average. Offensively, they've managed to score 485 runs, maintaining a batting average of .227 and an on-base percentage of .301. Elly De La Cruz stands out with a .255 batting average, 18 home runs, and 45 RBIs. Notably, the Reds have scored at least four runs in four of their last six games.\n\nOn the other side, the Miami Marlins, holding a 42-70 record, are experiencing a mixed period of form. They've won three out of their last five games and come off a series split with Atlanta. Before that, they showed resilience by splitting a series with Tampa Bay and winning subsequent series against Milwaukee and Baltimore. With a 7-5 record in their last 12 games, the Marlins appear to be slightly more consistent recently.\n\nPitching-wise, Miami holds a 4.46 ERA, a 1.36 WHIP, and a .253 opponent batting average. Their offensive stats include 408 runs scored, a .238 batting average, and a .291 on-base percentage. Jake Burger has been a standout performer with a .240 batting average, along with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. Impressively, the Marlins have managed to score at least four runs in ten of their last 14 games.\n\nStarting tonight, Cincinnati will likely field Nick Martinez, who has a balanced record of 5-5 with a 3.65 ERA and a 1.13 WHIP over 79.0 innings pitched. While Martinez has given up just one earned run in his last six outings, his short stints mean the bullpen will be crucial.\n\nIn contrast, Miami's Roddery Munoz, with a 2-5 record and a 5.45 ERA over 66.0 innings, will take the mound. Munoz has shown flashes of potential, allowing two earned runs or fewer in three of his last five starts. However, his shorter outings also put pressure on the bullpen to keep the game competitive.\n\nWhen examining recent betting trends, several noteworthy patterns emerge. For instance, the Reds have failed to cover the run line in five of their last six road games against teams with a losing record, while the Marlins have covered the run line in eight of their last nine home games. Meanwhile, total runs have frequently gone under the line in recent encounters -- with both teams experiencing this trend in their most recent games.\n\nPlayer Prop Insights:\n\nFor Miami, Jake Burger has been in top form, hitting at least one RBI in each of the Marlins' last four games against NL opponents. Additionally, he's recorded a double in three of his last four appearances against the Reds. Similarly, Nick Gordon has scored a run in each of the Marlins' last four games at home.\n\nFor Cincinnati, Elly De La Cruz has consistently contributed, recording at least one total base in each of the Reds' last eight games against NL East opponents, and notching a double in four of their last five road games against teams with losing records.\n\nEngaging with these patterns and recent player performances can provide valuable insights for those interested in betting on this series.", "source": {"uri": "sportstalkflorida.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Talk Florida - N"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carlos_sme@sportstalkflorida.com", "name": "Carlos Sme", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoanDepot_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LoanDepot Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportstalkflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/miami_marlins_and_cincinnati_reds_logos_with_a_baseball_field_background_featuring_players_in_action_with_the_crowd_and_stadium_lights_in_the_backdrop-1024x585.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Miami (42-70), meanwhile, has the third-worst record in the majors.\n\nDespite those numbers, however, the Reds can't afford to play sloppy baseball against the Marlins, who just completed a 5-4 road trip that included two straight wins over the Braves.\n\nMarlins first baseman Jonah Bride hit a three-run homer in Miami's 7-0 win over Atlanta on Sunday.\n\nBride has made eight straight starts for Miami, and he has hit three homers in his past five games.\n\n\"They've put a lot of trust in me,\" Bride said of the Marlins organization.\n\nThe Marlins are 9-7 since the All-Star break, and they continue to find ways to win even after dumping several standouts before the July 30 trade deadline.\n\nEven so, it's hard to argue that Miami's lineup is stronger than it was last year.\n\nFor example, second baseman Otto Lopez is hitting .227. Last year, Miami's second baseman was Luis Arraez, who averaged .354 and won the NL batting title. The Marlins traded Arraez to the San Diego Padres in May.\n\nOutfielders Bryan De La Cruz and Jazz Chisholm Jr. were dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees, respectively.\n\nDe La Cruz hit 18 homers and drove in 51 runs in 105 games with Miami this season. Chisholm is an explosive talent. In his final 198 games with the Marlins, dating back to the start of the 2023 season, he posted 32 homers, 101 RBIs and 44 steals.\n\nIn addition, the Marlins traded away closer Tanner Scott, who had a 1.18 ERA and 18 saves before he was shipped to San Diego.\n\nOn Monday, the Marlins are set to start rookie right-hander Roddery Munoz (2-5, 5.45 ERA).\n\nMunoz, who has never faced the Reds, has a 6.43 ERA in six home games (five starts), covering 28 innings. He has been better in his seven road starts with a 4.74 ERA in 38 innings.\n\nClearly, he needs to get off to better starts, having posted a 7.50 ERA in the first inning this year.\n\nThe Reds are expected to counter Munoz with Nick Martinez (5-5, 3.65).\n\nMartinez, a 33-year-old Miami native, has made 26 relief appearances this year (5-2, 1.86). But Martinez is 0-3 with a 7.36 ERA in five starts.\n\nHowever, Martinez is 3-0 with a 1.23 ERA in nine career appearances against the Marlins, including two starts. In five career appearances in Miami -- including one start -- Martinez is 2-0 with a 1.80 ERA.\n\nThe Reds, who have lost three of their past four games, boast another South Florida starter. Second baseman Jonathan India was born in Fort Lauderdale, about 30 minutes north of Miami.\n\nIndia was the NL Rookie of the Year in 2021, producing 21 homers and an .835 OPS. This year, he has nine homers and a .767 OPS.\n\n\"I love it here -- I've said that a million times,\" India said about playing for the Reds. He had been the subject of many trade rumors leading up to the deadline. \"This is a special place.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Gambling is not offered on this website in any form.\n\nThe Reds travel to south Florida to take on the Miami Marlins Monday night. This game will continue our MLB odds series as we hand out a Reds-Marlins prediction and pick. We will also ley you know how to watch the game.\n\n2024 Road Splits: 13 games, 1 start, 2.40 ERA, 0.77 WHIP, 30 innings pitched, 21K/3BB, .177 oBA\n\nRoddery Munoz (2-5) with a 5.45 ERA, 1.38 WHIP, 66 innings pitched, 57K/32BB, .236 oBA\n\nLast Start: at Tampa Bay Rays: Win, 5 innings, 4 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk, 7 strikeouts\n\n2024 Home Splits: 6 games, 5 starts, 6.43 ERA, 1.64 WHIP, 28 innings pitched, 23K/17BB, .261 oBA\n\nThe Reds should be able to get Munoz out of the game early. One thing Munoz does not do well is keep the ball in the zone. His walk rate is in just the 16th percentile in the MLB. He really struggles when it comes to limiting the free passes. If the Reds can stay patient at the plate, and force Munoz in the zone, they should have a good chance at winning the game.\n\nIf the Reds are able to force Munoz in the zone, there is a good chance the Reds can put good wood on the ball. Munoz allows a barrel percentage of 13.8 percent. That is in just the first percentile in the MLB. He allows hitters to really hit the ball hard, and the Reds need to take advantage of that. Cincinnati is is not a team that will chase pitches, but they really do not barrel the ball often. If the Reds can actually barrel the ball in this game, they will come out on top.\n\nWhy The Marlins Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nYes, Munoz has some control issues, and he gets hit around when he is in the zone, but the skill is there. Along with that, the Reds are in the bottom-10 in the MLB in barrel percentage, hard hit percentage, average exit velocity, batting average, and expected slugging percentage. Munoz is facing a team that will play to his strengths if he can limit the walks. With the Reds struggles at the plate, expect Munoz to have one of his better games Monday night.\n\nThe Marlins are facing Nick Martinez, who is making his first start in over two months in this game. He might not be fully conditioned to go deep into this game, which will work to their advantage. Along with that, Martinez allows opponents to hit .348 and slug .527 off him when he starts. He has been much better out of the bullpen, so this being a start for him could favor Miami. If Martinez goes back to pitching the way he was when he was starting games, the Marlins should win.\n\nFinal Reds-Marlins Prediction & Pick\n\nI would be surprised if this was a lower scoring game. I am expecting both teams to put up four or five runs in this game. With that said, I think the Reds will end up on top. If it comes down to which bullpen can hold the other team off for longer, my answer is the Reds. I will take Cincinnati to win this game straight up.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Reds-vs.-Marlins-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

What? No stolen base? It was his explosive response to his 0 for 14 when the game began.\n\nDe La Cruz was the hub cap of a big wheel 15-hit attack, eight for extra bases, that added up to a 10-3 Cincinnati Reds victory over the Miami Marlins.\n\nAnd De La Cruz continues to etch his name all over the Reds' record books. He is only the second Reds player since 1901 to have two doubles and two home runs in a game. Paul O'Neill did it in 1991 against the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field.\n\nHis offensive legend continues in his first full MLB season -- 20 homers, 57 RBI, a four extra-base hits game and the flashiest oven mitts in the game.\n\nNot even a broad smile reveals what kind of night De La Cruz has because he goes through life with a perma-press smile.\n\nAsked why playing Miami brings out his best (9-16, four homers, three doubles), De La Cruz smiled even wider and told Bally Sports Ohio, \"As I always say, it doesn't matter what team I play against, I'm gonna play hard.\"\n\nTry telling that to Miami.\n\nAnd about hitting two home runs and not stealing a base, even though he likes stealing bases best of all, he said, \"That felt great ... amazing, amazing.\"\n\nAdd a couple more amazings to that one.\n\nBy the way, those weren't the Miami Marlins the Reds crushed. They are the Miami Minnows.\n\nThe franchise traded nine players at the deadline -- its top three run producers, three of its top four home run hitters and its closer.\n\nNevertheless, Miami was 9-7 since the All-Star break and just split four games against the Atlanta Braves.\n\nBut the Reds continued turning loose big sticks, crashing four more home runs, nine in their last three games.\n\nAnd in four games, three wins, the Reds have scored 30 runs. They are beating up on baseball's have-nots -- 12-2 this season against Miami, Colorado and the Chicago White Sox.\n\nDe La Cruz, Noelvi Marte and Ty France homered to give the Reds a 7-0 lead in five innings as Reds starter Nick Martinez pitched five scoreless four-hit innings.\n\nMiami, though, had one big moment.\n\nJesus Sanchez, the highest paid Miami player at $2.1 million, hit the longest home run in MLB this season.\n\nHe was the first batter relief pitcher Jakob Junis faced in the sixth inning and Sanchez planted it high into the upper deck, 480 feet from home plate. It was three feet farther than the 477 footer Jorge Solar hit earlier this season.\n\nAnd Junis gave up three straight singles to open the seventh. One run scored on a double play and another scored on a single by Jonah Bride, cutting Cincinnati's lead to 7-3.\n\nThat ended the night for Junis. Buck Farmer replaced him and gave up a quick single, but retired Emmanuel Rivera on a ground ball.\n\nAt that point, Miami had outhit the Reds, 11-10, but stranded nine runners in seven innings.\n\nMiami starter Roddery Munoz lasted only 3 2/3 innings, the shortest start of his short career and probably wished his identical twin brother, Rolddy Munoz, had started the game.\n\nBut Rolddy is pitching in the Atlanta Braves minor league system.\n\nJonathan India opened the game with an infield hit and De La Cruz picked on the first pitch and lined it so fast into seats that right fielder Sanchez didn't budge and it was 2-0.\n\nIndia singled with one out in the third. De La Cruz grounded to the mound and Munoz threw wild to first base. Second baseman Otto Lopez picked it up and threw it into center and India scored from first on the double error. De La Cruz end up on third and scored on TJ Friedl's sacrifice fly and it was 4-0.\n\nIt became 6-0 in the fourth when Jake Fraley beat out an infield hit and Marte launched a two-run home run.\n\nThe lead expanded to 7-0 in fifth. France, 1 for 14 since arriving from Seattle via trade, ripped his first home run.\n\nAfter Miami made its little run, De La Cruz struck again, a 428-foot home run into the right field upper deck for an 8-3 lead.\n\nIt was Deuces Wild for the Reds as they scored two runs in the first, third, fourth, eighth and ninth.\n\nThe two in the ninth came on a two-run double by Jake Fraley after singles by TJ Friedl and France, who followed his home run with a double and a single for a three-hit night.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"},

His homers were clocked at 109 and 108 mph, and one of his doubles was clocked at 113 mph.\n\nMiami was led by Jesus Sanchez, who hit a mammoth 480-foot homer in the sixth inning off of reliever Jakob Junis. It was the longest homer in the majors this year.\n\nThe Reds took the lead just six pitches into the game on De La Cruz's two-run homer. Cincinnati also got a two-run homer from Noelvi Marte in the fourth and Ty France (three hit) socked a solo blast in the fifth. De La Cruz capped Cincinnati's power show with his second long ball of the night in the eighth.\n\nMartinez (6-5) allowed four hits and no walks.

Jonah Bride's RBI single was the key hit in the latter rally.\n\nHowever, De La Cruz's homer in the eighth stretched Cincinnati's lead to 8-3, and the Reds cruised from there. Jake Fraley capped the scoring with a two-run double in the ninth.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bradenton.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_France", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Junis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Junis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Greek", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Greek", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/nia9xd/picture290781254/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/a85d5c3b-6198-46bc-b168-bfe3f53dc81a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-22", "textStart": 967, "textEnd": 973}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS (AP) -- Sean Manaea won consecutive starts for the first time this season, Tyrone Taylor hit a three-run double from the No. 2 slot in the batting order and the New York Mets beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-0 Monday in the makeup of a May 8 rainout.\n\nManaea (8-4) allowed six hits in seven innings, struck out 10 and walked none. He has pitched 14 scoreless innings in his last two starts, giving up eight hits, striking out 21 and walking one. The Mets have won eight of his last 10 starts.\n\nRyne Stanek and Edwin D\u00edaz finished with hitless relief in the Mets' fourth shutout -- all from July 11 on.\n\nNew York (59-53) won the season series 4-2 and holds the tiebreak advantage over the Cardinals should it be needed to determine a wild-card berth or postseason homefield advantage. The Mets are 10-7 since the All-Star break.\n\nGIANTS 4, NATIONALS 1\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Matt Chapman homered in his third straight game, Logan Webb pitched into the sixth inning and San Francisco beat Washington.\n\nThe Giants have won nine of their past 12 games and at 57-57 have reached the .500 mark for the first time since they entered play on June 1 at 29-29 before an eventual loss to the Yankees.\n\nSan Francisco's Tyler Fitzgerald had two hits and went deep for the second straight game. He has homered in 10 of his past 17 games, with 11 homers total.\n\nWebb (9-8), coming off a five-hit shutout against the A's, allowed a run on four hits over 5 2/3 innings. He struck out four and walked three while throwing 95 pitches. Camilo Doval struck out the side in the ninth for his 21st save.\n\nWashington starter Patrick Corbin (2-12), who was seeking his 100th career win, allowed four runs on seven hits in six innings.\n\nREDS 10, MARLINS 3\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- Elly De La Cruz became the youngest Cincinnati player with four extra-base hits in a game since at least 1901 and the Reds overcame Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez's 480-foot home run, the longest in the major league this season, in a 10-3 win over Miami.\n\nNick Martinez (6-5) pitched five scoreless innings to win on his 34th birthday in his first start since May 22.\n\nDe La Cruz entered in an 0-for-13 slide and put Cincinnati ahead with a two-run homer off Roddery Mu\u00f1oz (2-6) in the first inning. He doubled in the fourth and sixth innings and hit a solo homer in the eighth against Shaun Anderson, his 20th home run this season. De La Cruz has three multihomer games, including two this season.\n\nIt was the 20th four-extra-base hit game by a Reds player since 1901 and at 22 years, 207 days De La Cruz became the youngest Cincinnati player to accomplish the feat since then.\n\nDe La Cruz has a major league-leading 57 steals and joined Hall of Famer Joe Morgan and Eric Davis as the only Reds with 20 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. De La Cruz has four homers against Miami this year.\n\nTy France had three hits, including his first homer since he was acquired from Seattle on July 30, and Noelvi Mart\u00e9 also went deep for the Reds.\n\nMartinez, who had been pitching out of the bullpen, allowed four hits, struck out five and walked none in a 70-pitch in outing.\n\nDIAMONDBACKS 7, GUARDIANS 6, 10 INNINGS\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) -- Eugenio Su\u00e1rez singled off All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase in the 10th inning to score automatic runner Corbin Carroll, lifting Arizona to a victory over Cleveland.\n\nThe Guardians had forced extra innings on Daniel Schneemann's sacrifice fly in the ninth off Ryan Thompson, which plated Bo Naylor. There were four lead changes and five ties in the wild, interleague matchup.\n\nKetel Marte and Gabriel Moreno hit back-to-back homers off Logan Allen to start the game, helping the Diamondbacks move within a percentage point of the top National League wild-card spot and win for the 22nd time in 31 games since June 29.\n\nGold Glove catcher Moreno exited the game with a left groin strain in the second.\n\nThompson (6-3) allowed one run in one inning for the victory, while Justin Martinez picked up his first save of the season. Clase (4-2) had his eight-inning scoreless streak end with the unearned run.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Miami is on a two-game winning streak as they split the series with the Atlanta Braves over the weekend at Truist Park.\n\nThe Reds aren't having a good season. They currently hold a 53-58 record, which puts them in last place in the National League Central division. They are coming off a disappointing series against the San Francisco Giants over the weekend, in which they got no-hit by Blake Snell on Friday and managed just four in an 8-2 loss on Sunday.\n\nAs for pitching matchups, Marlins right-hand pitcher Roddery Mu\u00f1oz (2-5, 5.45 ERA) takes the mound hoping to get his third win of the season. It's been a bit of a struggle for him since being called up in April for a doubleheader. However, he had a decent outing in his last start against the Tampa Bay Rays, only allowing two runs on four hits with seven strikeouts in five innings, leading to a Marlins 6-2 victory.\n\nMu\u00f1oz will pitch against Nick Martinez (5-5, 3.65 ERA), who will make his first start since May 22. He pitched four innings in relief behind opener Tony Santillan in a 6-3 win over the Chicago Cubs last Tuesday, and he is only getting two days' rest after working an inning on Friday against the Giants. However, since he only threw 17 pitches, he probably won't be on any limits.\n\nHere are the lineups for both teams\n\nCincinnati Reds\n\n1.) 2B Jonathan India\n\n2.) SS Elly De La Cruz\n\n3.) LF Spencer Steer\n\n4.) CF TJ Friedl\n\n5.) C Tyler Stephenson\n\n6.) DH Jeimer Candelario\n\n7.) 1B Ty France\n\n8.) RF Jake Fraley\n\n9.) 3B Noelvi Marte\n\nSP Nick Martinez\n\nMiami Marlins\n\n1.) SS Xavier Edwards\n\n2.) 1B Jake Burger\n\n3.) RF Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez\n\n4.) DH Jonah Bride\n\n5.) LF Kyle Stowers\n\n6.) 3B Emmanuel Rivera\n\n7.) 2B Otto Lopez\n\n8.) CF Vidal Bruj\u00e1n\n\n9.) C Nick Fortes\n\nSP Roddery Mu\u00f1oz\n\nHow to watch\n\nThe first pitch is scheduled for 6:40 p.m. ET. Marlins fans can watch it on Bally Sports Florida.

This was the game after the Marlins won two in a row against division-rival Atlanta Braves.\n\nDespite the Marlins getting 11 hits in this game, they only managed to score three runs. The biggest highlight on offense for them was a long 480-foot home run by Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez to get a run on the board after being down 7-0. S\u00e1nchez followed up with a double play that scored a run from third base in the seventh inning. Jonah Bride had an RBI single in the seventh. Otherwise, there wasn't much to show for on offense against Reds starting pitcher Nick Martinez, who went five innings and only gave up four hits and struck out five batters. It was his first start since May 22.\n\nMarlins starting pitcher Roddery Mu\u00f1oz didn't have a good start. He went three and two-thirds innings, allowing six runs on seven hits, three walks, and struck out two batters. Two of the runs were unearned due to a couple of errors on the same play in the third inning. Mu\u00f1oz allowed Elly De La Cruz to reach base safely via a throwing error, and then Jonathan India scored on a ball thrown away to left field by second baseman Otto Lopez.\n\nThe Marlins are now 42-71 while the Reds tentatively keep their season alive with a 54-58 record. The Reds have lots of catching up to do in the National League wild-card race as they are currently six and a half games out of the third spot.\n\nThe series continues tomorrow night with Game Two at loanDepot Park featuring two pitchers with ERAs below four. Nick Lodolo will start for the Reds while Max Meyer goes for the Marlins.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_gibberman@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jordan Gibberman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes\u00fas_S\u00e1nchez_(outfielder)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez (outfielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An\u00edbal_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoanDepot_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LoanDepot Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lodolo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Lodolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-22", "textStart": 802, "textEnd": 808}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

He has pitched 14 scoreless innings in his last two starts, giving up eight hits, striking out 21 and walking one.

He has homered in 10 of his past 17 games, with 11 homers total.\n\nWebb (9-8), coming off a five-hit shutout against the A's, allowed a run on four hits over 5 2/3 innings. He struck out four and walked three while throwing 95 pitches. Camilo Doval struck out the side in the ninth for his 21st save.\n\nWashington starter Patrick Corbin (2-12), who was seeking his 100th career win, allowed four runs on seven hits in six innings.\n\nTravis Blankenhorn had two hits for the Nationals.\n\nFitzgerald led off the game with a home run.\n\nIn the third, Corbin walked Michael Conforto with two outs and a runner on second and Chapman hit the first pitch to him for his 18th homer to give the Giants a 4-0 lead.", "source": {"uri": "s24526.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_erzar@s24526.pcdn.co", "name": "John Erzar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Clase", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Clase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edwin D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryne_Stanek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryne Stanek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

I am stunned we are still getting this price on Jake Burger to drive in a run when the Miami Marlins host the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night. And you are going to think it's even crazier when I break down this MLB pick for you.\n\nLet's start with Burger himself. The Marlins slugger is on a heater. He's been solid since the start of July, hitting .294 with a .987 OPS, 10 home runs, and 20 RBI but he's really turned it on lately going 12-35 (.385) with five dingers and nine RBI over his last nine games. He's also driven in at least one run in seven of his last nine and the last six in a row overall.\n\nA big reason for that is because Burger now gets to hit behind breakout rookie Xavier Edwards. The 24-year-old is hitting a ridiculous .396 with a .952 OPS since taking over as the Marlins' everyday shortstop at the start of July. He's also scored 17 runs over that 28-game stretch.\n\nThen there is the pitching matchup. Burger, Edwards, and the rest of the Bottom Feeders lineup will face off against Reds' veteran right-hander Nick Martinez.\n\nWhile Martinez doesn't give up hard hits, he gives up a lot of them, surrendering a .251 opponent expected batting average which is well below the league average. This will also be Martinez's first start since May after spending most of the season as the Reds' long reliever. As a starter his ERA balloons to 7.36 while surrendering a .348 batting average and a .905 OPS.\n\nI like the Fish to keep thrashing and Burger to stay hot and I am backing him to drive in another run tonight.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/3259f0c6-7b94-4ed2-afbd-6d50198b9e64.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He finished 4-for-5 with three RBIs and three runs.\n\n\"I typically don't give guys too much credit from the other side,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said when asked about De La Cruz, \"but Elly had some incredible at-bats (Monday).\n\n\"He can put up some crazy numbers because his power/speed combo is super rare. He is a talented and special player in the league.\"\n\nSo far this season, De La Cruz has 24 doubles, seven triples, 20 homers, 48 RBIs and a major-league-high 57 steals.\n\nWith De La Cruz on his side, it's no wonder why Bell likes the Reds' chances even though they are 6 1/2 games out of the last National League playoff position.\n\n\"The goal is still the postseason,\" Bell said. \"We have to focus on our strength as a team. We continue to believe that we are going to achieve our goal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Miami has the third-worst record in the major leagues.\n\nKnown for their good young pitching when they surprisingly made the playoffs last year, the Marlins have struggled on the mound in 2024. In fact, they haven't had a quality start since June 27.\n\nMost of that is due to season-ending injuries to star pitchers such as Sandy Alcantara, Eury Perez and Jesus Luzardo.\n\nIn addition, the Marlins traded away dominant closer Tanner Scott and other relievers prior to the July 30 deadline.\n\nBehind the plate, the Marlins have another issue, as catcher Nick Fortes left Monday's game due to what Schumaker called \"a quad issue.\"\n\nBright spots for the Marlins include right fielder Jesus Sanchez and rookie shortstop Xavier Edwards.\n\nSanchez drilled a 480-foot homer on Monday, the longest blast in the majors this season.\n\n\"Sanchez has that power,\" Schumaker said. \"He has the ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark to all sides of the stadium, line to line. He's got real raw power. I think he's got some of the best power in the game, so it's good to see.\"\n\nEdwards, through 115 at-bats, is batting .383 with a .926 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. After going 2-for-5 in the series opener, he has reached base in 22 consecutive games.\n\nThe Tuesday pitching matchup features a pair of former first-round draft picks: Reds left-hander Nick Lodolo (8-4, 3.99 ERA) and Miami right-hander Max Meyer (2-1, 3.81).\n\nLodolo, 26, was the seventh overall pick in the 2019 draft, taken by the Reds out of TCU. In 43 games in the majors (all starts), he is 14-12 with a 4.18 ERA. Lodolo is 1-0 with a 1.69 ERA in two career starts against the Marlins, but he has never pitched in Miami.\n\nMeyer, 25, was the third overall pick in the 2020 draft, taken by the Marlins out of Minnesota. In seven games in the majors (all starts), he is 2-2 with a 4.50 ERA. Meyer has never faced the Reds.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He doubled in the fourth and sixth innings and hit a solo homer in the eighth against Shaun Anderson, his 20th home run this season. De La Cruz has three multihomer games, including two this season.\n\nIt was the 20th four-extra-base hit game by a Reds player since 1901 and at 22 years, 207 days De La Cruz became the youngest Cincinnati player to accomplish the feat since then.\n\nDe La Cruz has a major league-leading 57 steals and joined Hall of Famer Joe Morgan and Eric Davis as the only Reds with 20 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. De La Cruz has four homers against Miami this year.\n\nS\u00e1nchez drove a changeup from Jakob Junis into the right-center field upper deck in the sixth. The drive outdistanced a 478-foot homer by San Francisco's Jorge Soler at San Francisco on July 21.\n\nTy France had three hits, including his first homer since he was acquired from Seattle on July 30, and Noelvi Mart\u00e9 also went deep for the Reds.\n\nMartinez, who had been pitching out of the bullpen, allowed four hits, struck out five and walked none in a 70-pitch in outing.\n\nXavier Edwards singled twice for the Marlins, extending his on base games streak to 22.\n\nMu\u00f1oz gave up six runs -- four earned -- seven hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nReds: INF Matt McClain (rib cage stress reaction) has not been scheduled for rehab games, manager David Bell said.\n\nMarlins: C Nick Fortes left after singling in the seventh inning and limping when he reached first base.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Nick Lodolo (8-4, 3.99) will start the second game of the series for the Reds on Tuesday while the Marlins will go with RHP Max Meyer (2-1, 3.81).\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It started off looking like a bullpen day but it turned out to be just a normal game. The bats woke up and hopefully, they saved a little juice for the remaining three games. It marked the 10th time the Reds scored 10 runs. Four different Reds logged multiple hits on the day.\n\n1. What Bullpen Day?\n\nHeading into Monday night's game, it looked like Nick Martinez was going to just open for a bullpen day. Don't tell him that because he went out there and had one of the best outings of his season.\n\nMartinez threw 70 pitches and turned in a five-inning effort while allowing just four hits. Most impressively, Martinez didn't walk a single batter and did not allow a run to score.\n\nEarlier in the season, Martinez came on as the long reliever for a bullpen day and tossed five innings of shutout baseball and just one hit.\n\nThe Reds obviously believe he can be an integral piece of next year's ballclub. Martinez was often named as a potential trade piece. Considering he has a 0.519 ERA over his last seven outings (17 1/3 innings), that decision might have been the correct one.\n\n2. Another Home Run Derby\n\nIt seems like this season has been either scoring in bunches or nothing at all for the Reds. On Monday, the bunches won the day.\n\nElly De La Cruz (twice), Noelvi Marte, and Ty France all found the seats. De La Cruz had another one of his quintessential days where he got on base five times, four of which were extra-base hits. Those four extra-base hits were recorded at over 100 MPH exit velocity. Before Jesus Sanchez's 480-foot bomb in the sixth, De La Cruz had each of the three hardest-hit balls on the night.\n\nThe Reds chased Roddery Munoz in the fourth after managing seven hits and four earned runs off the starter (six total runs). The offense quieted down a bit, only managing three hits and one run after.\n\nTonight's performance needs to not be a few-and-far-between kind of thing. It was recently unearthed that while the Reds' Pythagorean win-loss record is about six games better than the actual record, it's a tad disingenuous. The Reds' run differential against three of the worst teams in baseball (Los Angeles Angels, Colorado Rockies, Chicago White Sox) is +63. Against everyone else (heading into tonight's game), it was -35.\n\nHowever, beating up on bad teams is how the Reds have gotten to this point. Why not continue it and maybe run into a little momentum for the trip to Milwaukee?\n\n3. Bullpen struggles\n\nHeading into the sixth, the Reds led, 6-0. Then, the newly acquired right-handed reliever Jakob Junis continued his struggles. In his first appearance last Wednesday, Junis was lit up for three runs off four hits in his 1 1/3 innings. Tonight, it was more of the same.\n\nJunis' final line tonight was 1 2/3 innings, six hits, and three runs.\n\nAfter just a week of baseball, it's feeling like the Brewers won the trade. Junis has not looked at all like the competent reliever with shutdown upside as was expected. He has been more of one of those relievers you throw in during a blowout to eat innings.\n\nHe gave up a 480-foot home run to Sanchez that was 116.4 MPH off the bat. The RBI double play, also given up to Sanchez, was 108.2 MPH off the bat.\n\nThere is some disconnect here between the Reds and Junis. Hopefully, Junis can get this a bit more under control as the season progresses because if the Reds want to even remotely entertain going to the playoffs, throwing a guy with an 18.00 ERA since joining the club isn't going to get it done.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "drew_crabtree@postandcourier.com", "name": "Drew Crabtree", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_reliever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long reliever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_France", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Junis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Junis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Run_Derby_(Major_League_Baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

After Skip Schumaker's promise of notching better success from last season, it looks like the squad will fall short of expectations. However, it looks like there are some bright spots that they could continue to work on such that they get back into postseason contention in the coming years. One of those moments happened when Jesus Sanchez blasted an insane moonshot of a home run at the expense of the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThe Marlins are on the verge of winning their series against the Reds. Skip Schumaker has led this squad to two wins already and can cap off everything with a sweep. However, the team from Ohio came out swinging. All hopes of crushing the Reds would then come to an end. So, a lot of Marlins fans were chasing for a consolation. The loss cost them what could have been a three-game winning streak.\n\nHowever, this was not the mind of every Marlins and baseball fan. What they cared about was how insane Jesus Sanchez's home run was. He sent the ball out of LoanDepot Park which dropped a lot of individuals' jaws. How crazy was this feat? Well, he ended up notching a 480-foot home run which is the farthest that anyone has accomplished in the ongoing MLB season.\n\nMarlins fans go nuts despite the loss to the Reds\n\nThe Marlins faithful quickly took to social media to unveil their amazement.\n\n\"Jesus Sanchez...WOW! Exit velo: 116.4 mph (hardest hit ball of the season for Sanchez). Distance: 480 ft (longest home run by an MLB player this season).13th home run of the season for Sanchy,\" a fan wrote.\n\nSome were even recalling what Sanchez did with the Marlins two years ago when they faced the Colorado Rockies. Back then, he obliterated the ball and sent it on a course for 496 feet up in the air.\n\nOthers are looking forward to the Marlins slugger breaking a big record, \"With his #13, Dominican Jesus Sanchez hit the longest HR in the current GL season (480 feet) tonight. With one more he will equal his highest total: 14 in 2021 and 2023.\"\n\nJesus Sanchez's home run might just be a good sign that the Marlins' future is going to be better.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Schumaker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skip Schumaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoanDepot_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LoanDepot Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Fans-go-bonkers-after-Jesus-Sanchez-crushed-2024s-longest-home-run.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792601", "eventUri": "eng-9792601", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

As we dive into FanDuel Sportsbook's odds and get ready to put our money where our mouths are, let's break down some essential insights to help you make the most informed calls.\n\nCincinnati Reds:\n\nThe Reds are coming into this four-game series after a rough weekend at home, having dropped two out of three games to the San Francisco Giants. Their offense has been sputtering, averaging just over three runs per game over their last nine outings. On the road, they're 25-27 and 60-51 against the spread (ATS).\n\nMiami Marlins:\n\nThe Marlins just split a four-game series with the Braves, capping it off with a stellar 7-0 shutout thanks to Edward Cabrera's dominant performance (5 IP, 0 ER, 3 H, 2 BB, 8 K). Slugger Jonah Bride's three-run homer in the fourth was the big offensive highlight. At home, they hold a 22-34 record and are 53-59 ATS.\n\nWe're looking at RHP Nick Martinez taking the mound for the Reds. Martinez, with a 5-5 record and a 3.65 ERA, has been quite dependable. However, his last outing was a struggle; he gave up five earned runs in just over four innings against the Padres.\n\nOn the other side, RHP Roddery Munoz will start for the Marlins. Munoz has had a shaky season with a 2-5 record and a 5.45 ERA. However, he bounced back in his last start against Tampa Bay, securing a win by giving up only two earned runs over five innings.\n\nWhen it comes to betting, here are three key insights to consider:\n\nIf you're still scratching your head over how to play this, think about the recent scoring trends and pitching struggles. Both hurlers today haven't exactly been locked down on the mound, which could lead to a high-scoring game. This may be why the Over on 8.5 runs (-122) looks particularly attractive.\n\nIt's definitely a game that makes you pause -- you've got a Reds team struggling to put runs on the board and a Marlins team that's inconsistent at best.

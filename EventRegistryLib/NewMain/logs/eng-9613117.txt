He was 33.\n\nGordon grew up in San Jose and was a McDonald's All-American at Archbishop Mitty High School. He played two seasons each for the Bruins and Lobos before a professional career that also included stints in the NBA's G League and numerous leagues overseas.\n\nHis younger brother, Aaron Gordon, is a starting forward for the Denver Nuggets. Drew Gordon was in attendance for a number of Nuggets games this season.\n\n\"Drew was far too young to leave this world, but his legacy will live on through his three beautiful children and all of his loved ones,\" the Nuggets posted on X Thursday night. \"Our hearts are with Aaron and the Gordon family during this extremely difficult time.\"\n\nAs a freshman at UCLA during the 2008-09 season, the 6-foot-9 Gordon averaged 3.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 34 games off the bench. He was the Bruins' starting center for the first six games of his sophomore season -- averaging 11.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2 blocks a game -- before leaving the program abruptly upon mutual agreement after butting heads with then-coach Ben Howland.\n\n\"Our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Drew Gordon, a former UCLA forward who has passed away at the age of 33,\" the UCLA men's basketball program posted on X Thursday night.\n\nGordon transferred to New Mexico and found his fit with the Lobos, starting in 53 of his 61 games and averaging 13.4 points and 10.8 rebounds over two seasons.\n\n\"I'm just in a better place,\" Gordon, then a senior, told The Times in November 2011. \"I loved my teammates at UCLA; I love my teammates here, and playing for [coach] Steve Alford is one of the best experiences I could possibly have.\"\n\nThe New Mexico men's basketball program posted on X Thursday night: \"We are heartbroken over the passing of Drew Gordon. A two-time all-conference forward, he helped lead us to the 2012 Mountain West title.\"\n\nGordon went undrafted out of college but landed with the 76ers organization, which posted its condolences to Gordon's family and friends Friday morning.\n\nDuring the 2014-15 season, Gordon played nine games with the 76ers, averaging 1.9 points and 2 rebounds in 7.9 minutes a game. In 41 games with the organization's G League team, the Delaware Blue Coats, he averaged 13 points and 10.6 rebounds in 32.9 minutes a game.\n\nGordon also played 35 games for the Brooklyn Nets G League affiliate in Long Island during the 2018-19 season, averaging 7.3 points and 6.7 rebounds in 16.1 minutes a game.\n\n\"Drew Gordon was my roommate, one of the best teammates I've ever had, and my brother for life,\" Gideon Gamble, who played with Gordon on the Blue Coats, posted on X. \"He encouraged me when I wasn't active and was excited for me whenever I did have good games. His wonderful family, Parents and Wife, treated me like family. My [heart] goes out to them.\"\n\nGordon's basketball career took him around the world and included All-Star stints in Italy and Russia. He was playing for BC Budivelnyk Kyiv in early 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a 2022 ESPN Andscape article, Gordon left the area with his wife, Angela, and their family -- which at the time included 3-year-old Zayne and 3-month-old Brody -- to reside in Denver near his brother and their parents.\n\n\"Me and my family have literally been able to travel the world and see things that most people wouldn't be able to see, whether it be one of the big cities in Russia or Turkey or France, Greece, you name it,\" Gordon told ESPN Andscape. \"We've been able to go and be a part of that culture and that lifestyle.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType":

Despite two relatively successful years as a Bruin, Gordon elected to transfer to New Mexico for his junior season. He averaged at least 13 points and 10 rebounds per game in each of his two seasons as a Lobo, and with that performance, he put himself on the NBA's radar.\n\nHe ultimately was not drafted in 2012, but played for the Dallas Mavericks in Summer League. From there, he bounced between foreign leagues and the G League before ultimately signing with the Philadelphia 76ers, his only NBA team. He played in nine games for the 76ers during the 2014-15 season before ultimately getting waived in December.\n\nHe played nearly a decade of professional basketball after that, most of it coming abroad.

I love you and I'm sorry for your loss.\"\n\nAs of Friday morning, Nuggets star Aaron Gordon had not yet commented on the death of his older brother.\n\nIn 2022, Drew made headlines when he recounted fleeing Ukraine with his family when the war began.\n\nHe was playing in Kyiv on a one-year basketball contract and initially planned to stay until the end of the deal. However, he decided to leave after receiving a message from the US Embassy advising him to leave the city.\n\n\"My advice to him was get your family out of a war that you don't need to fight,\" Aaron Gordon told Andscape at the time.\n\nCareer Never Ended\n\nDrew then returned to Denver to be near his brother and spoke about his love for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. \"Ukraine is a proud country,\" he said. \"The people are proud to be Ukrainian. There's a lot of history that goes along with being Ukrainian and they fight hard for what they believe. They also make sure that whoever visits Ukraine sees its beauty for what it is.\n\n\"There's a lot of monuments that are decades old from past run-ins and past conflicts that they were able to prevail with. And they're good people, man.\n\n\"I really respect all of the people of Ukraine, not just because it's a country I played in and they're nice to basketball players. I've seen how they interact with each other. I've seen how just the day-to-day life is.\n\n\"And they're just super-solid, solid people. And I hope that this war and the conflict right now is resolved soon, and they are able to keep the same energy that they've had about them, because it's honestly something that people can take note of and learn from, because they're good people, and I wish them well.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

In 1995 and 1997 Gordon would finish on the podium but still walk away without the win.\n\nHowever, in the final years of the 20th century, Gordon would start his winning run at Sonoma as he qualified for pole position in 1998 and 1999 and held the lead for back-to-back wins.\n\nNot looking to let his dominant streak fade, in 2000 Gordon would return to the winner's circle and secure a three-peat victory.\n\nGordon remains the only NASCAR Cup Series driver to take three consecutive victories at Sonoma Raceway.\n\nMartin Truex Jr. is the only driver to come close to matching Gordon with wins in 2018 and 2019. He would lose out to Elk Grove's Kyle Larson in 2021 to secure the third consecutive win.\n\nIn 2001, Gordon would return to pole position at the Northern California track but lose out to one of his strongest rivals, Tony Stewart.\n\nGordon would not return to the top step of the podium at Sonoma until 2004 after leading an impressive 92 of 110 laps.\n\nIn 2005, Gordon would again secure pole at a track he was now well known for being dominant at, but would once again lose out to Stewart.\n\nThe now four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion would secure his fifth and final win at Sonoma Raceway in 2006.\n\nGordon would come close to securing three more race wins at Sonoma in 2011, 2013 and 2014 after finishing in second at each race.\n\nIn his 23 races at Sonoma Raceway Gordon secured five race wins, 13 podium finishes, five starts from pole position and led a combined 457 laps.\n\nGordon's Northern California Roots\n\nBorn in Vallejo on Aug. 4, 1972, to Vacaville residents Carol Ann Bickford and William Grinnell Gordon, the boy would show his racing chops at the age of five.\n\nWhen Gordon was five he began oval-racing in quarter midget cars and is believed to have competed in his first ever race at the Roy Hayer Memorial Race Track in Rio Linda.\n\nGordon's talents would shine even as a child as he won 35 main events and set five track records. By 1979 he had secured 51 wins in children's small-car races called quarter midget races.\n\nThe family was not long for California though as they wanted to move somewhere that would provide more racing opportunities for Gordon.\n\nIn the 1980s the family moved from Vallejo to Pittsboro, Indiana.", "source": {"uri": "fox40.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox40 KTXL"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_nobert@fox40.com", "name": "Matthew Nobert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt_concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asphalt concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallejo,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vallejo, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vallejo, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Truex_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Truex Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_Grove,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elk Grove, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Elk Grove, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_midget_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarter midget racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacaville,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vacaville, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vacaville, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Linda,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Linda, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Linda, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsboro,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsboro, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsboro, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://fox40.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/05/GettyImages-71295133.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613117", "eventUri": "eng-9613117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

PC: Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine Debris Project\n\nA team of 12 from the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine Debris Project (PMDP), a Hawai\u02bbi-based nonprofit organization, returned to Honolulu, having conducted their first of three marine debris cleanups planned for 2024. The latest mission lasted 19 days, from April 15 to May 3, with crews removing a total of 70,080 pounds of marine debris and cleaning 10.7 miles of shoreline at Kuaihelani (Midway Atoll) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands within Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument (PMNM).\n\nThe cleanup mission targeted the removal of entanglement and ingestion hazards to wildlife from the shorelines of Eastern, Spit, and Sand Islands within Kuaihelani. Home to more than 70 endangered Hawaiian monk seals, the atoll also serves as the nesting grounds for the world's largest colony of m\u014dl\u012b (Laysan Albatross) and nearly two million birds of 19 different species, including the world's most endangered duck, the Laysan duck.\n\nSydney Luitgaarden of PMDP remarked, \"PMDP came to Kuaihelani with the goal of removing 35,000 pounds of marine debris to preemptively protect the wildlife, and I'm proud to say we more than doubled our goal.\"\n\nUS Sen. Brian Schatz reflected on the mission, \"Thanks to the great work of PMDP, more than 70,000 pounds of debris has been removed from Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea, allowing us to protect endangered wildlife, sustain coral reefs, and explore new ways to conserve the marine monument going forward.\"\n\nBreakdown of the 70,080 Pounds of Marine Debris Removed:\n\nMarc and Lynne Benioff, private matching donors to the project said, \"We are so grateful to PMDP and their partners for this latest success in removing plastic pollution and other marine debris that threaten our ecosystems and ocean health, and for all they do to protect this place that is sacred to Hawai'i.\"\n\nThis cleanup mission was supported by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Elaine Johnson, USFWS Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge Manager, stated, \"The blitz-style work achieved by PMDP was amazing to behold. The Fish and Wildlife Service is proud to partner with PMDP once again to keep Kuaihelani safe for the wildlife that depend on this atoll year-round\".\n\nNancy Wallace, Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Program, added, \"The NOAA Marine Debris Program has been a proud supporter of marine debris removal efforts in the Monument since 2006. We are pleased to continue NOAA's legacy in this culturally and ecologically significant place, and support the efforts of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine Debris Project.\"\n\nPMDP extends a huge thank you to our major funding partners for making this work possible. The NOAA Marine Debris Program is supporting this work through a 5-year grant to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation using $5.8M in funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding to NFWF is being matched by Marc and Lynne Benioff for a total investment of $12M over FY22-FY26. Additional funding for this mission is being provided by the NOAA Damage Assessment, Remediation, and Restoration Program and the M/V Casitas Trustee Council. Additional support comes from the Pahlmeyer 'Ohana, McPike-Zima Foundation, the JEM Project, the Bruce G. Geary Foundation, The Hawaiian Islands Trading Company, numerous community donors, and in-kind support from USFWS.\n\n\"Climate change is upon us, and the hard work being done by the NOAA Marine Debris Program has been necessitated by human impacts on our oceans,\" said Hawai'i Gov. Josh Green, M.D. \"I was a young lawmaker in 2007 when then-First Lady Laura Bush dedicated the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument, and it filled me with hope for the preservation of the 7,000 marine species there, 25% of them, endemic to the Hawaiian islands. The State of Hawai'i is a co-manager of the Monument, including management of the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Sanctuary on Kure, which is the northernmost island in Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea. Hawai'i is so fortunate to have benefactors like Marc and Lynne Benioff to help remove the debris that endangers our already endangered species.\"\n\nOver the past four years, PMDP has removed over 785,000 pounds of marine debris from the remote islands and atolls within PMNM. They aim to remove an additional 215,000 pounds later this year during two 30-day, ship-based cleanup missions scheduled for August through October 2024.", "source": {"uri": "mauinow.com", "dataType":

At some point, humans decided that dumping trash into the oceans was a consequence free choice. But they were sorely mistaken.\n\nA team of twelve from the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine Debris Project (PMDP), a non-profit based in Hawai\u02bbi, returned to Honolulu after completing their first of three planned marine debris cleanups for 2024.\n\nDuring a 19-day mission from April 15 to May 3, they removed 70,080 pounds of marine debris and cleaned 10.7 miles (130 acres) of shoreline at Kuaihelani (Midway Atoll) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands within the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument (PMNM).\n\nThe cleanup targeted entanglement and ingestion hazards for wildlife on Eastern, Spit and Sand Islands within Kuaihelani.\n\nThe atoll, home to over 70 endangered Hawaiian monk seals and the world's largest colony of m\u014dl\u012b (Laysan Albatross), also hosts nearly two million birds from 19 species, including the critically endangered Laysan duck.\n\nSydney Luitgaarden of PMDP noted, \"PMDP came to Kuaihelani with the goal of removing 35,000 pounds of marine debris to preemptively protect the wildlife, and I'm proud to say we more than doubled our goal.\"\n\nUnited States Senator Brian Schatz praised the effort. He stated, \"Thanks to the great work of PMDP, more than 70,000 pounds of debris has been removed from Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea, allowing us to protect endangered wildlife, sustain coral reefs, and explore new ways to conserve the marine monument going forward.\"\n\nBreakdown of the 70,080 Pounds of Marine Debris Removed:\n\nMarc and Lynne Benioff, private matching donors, expressed their gratitude. They had this to say about the cleanup: \"We are so grateful to PMDP and their partners for this latest success in removing plastic pollution and other marine debris that threaten our ecosystems and ocean health, and for all they do to protect this place that is sacred to Hawai'i.\"\n\nThe mission was supported by the U.. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).\n\nElaine Johnson, USFWS Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge Manager, commented, \"The blitz-style work achieved by PMDP was amazing to behold. The Fish and Wildlife Service is proud to partner with PMDP once again to keep Kuaihelani safe for the wildlife that depend on this atoll year-round.\"\n\nNancy Wallace, Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Program, added, \"The NOAA Marine Debris Program has been a proud supporter of marine debris removal efforts in the Monument since 2006. We are pleased to continue NOAA's legacy in this culturally and ecologically significant place, and support the efforts of the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine Debris Project.\"\n\nPMDP expressed gratitude to major funding partners, including the NOAA Marine Debris Program, which supports this work through a 5-year grant to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, using $5.8M in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nThis is matched by Marc and Lynne Benioff for a total investment of $12M over FY22-FY26. Additional funding comes from the NOAA Damage Assessment, Remediation and Restoration Program and the M/V Casitas Trustee Council, along with support from various other donors and organizations.\n\nHawai'i Governor Josh Green, M.D., remarked, \"Climate change is upon us, and the hard work being done by the NOAA Marine Debris Program has been necessitated by human impacts on our oceans. The State of Hawai'i is a co-manager of the Monument, including management of the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Sanctuary on Kure, which is the northernmost island in Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea. Hawai'i is so fortunate to have benefactors like Marc and Lynne Benioff to help remove the debris that endangers our already endangered species.\"\n\nOver the past four years, PMDP has removed over 785,000 pounds of marine debris from the remote islands and atolls within PMNM. They aim to remove an additional 215,000 pounds during two 30-day, ship-based cleanup missions scheduled for August through October 2024.", "source": {"uri": "khon2.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

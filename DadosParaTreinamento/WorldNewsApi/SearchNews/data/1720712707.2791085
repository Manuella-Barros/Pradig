{"id": 232079454, "title": "BJP rejigs Bihar caste calculus as two new faces find place in Modi govt", "text": "While Nityananad Rai and Giriraj Singh, two veteran BJP leaders from Bihar, again found a place in the Union Council of Ministers on Sunday, two new faces from the state, Raj Bhushan Nishad and Satish Chandra Dubey, made the cut. The BJP, however, bypassed its core voter base of Vaishyas (Baniyas) while accommodating Nishad who is from the Mallah community (categorised as an Extremely Backward Class) and Dubey who is Brahmin. Rajputs and Kayasthas have also not found a place in the Union Council of Ministers unlike in 2019 when R K Singh, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Radha Mohan Singh (all Rajputs) and Ravi Shankar Prasad (Kayastha) were inducted. Giriraj Singh The three-time MP is an upper caste Bhumihar leader who served as a minister in the Nitish Kumar government from 2005 to 2013. Known to be an ardent Modi supporter, the 71-year-old rose in politics on a hardcore Hindutva line. Singh previously served as Union Rural Development and Panchayati Raj minister and this time edged out another Bhumihar leader \u2014 newly elected Nawada MP Vivek Thakur \u2014 for the ministerial berth. In the recently concluded polls, Singh defeated CPI(M)\u2019s Abdhesh Kumar Roy by more than 81,000 votes from Begusarai and was brought back to the Council of Ministers despite the BJP\u2019s Bihar ally JD(U) nominating Rajiv Ranjan Singh, also a Bhumihar. Nityanand Rai Rai (58), now a third-time MP from Ujiarpur, also took oath on Sunday. He has previously served as the Minister of State for Home Affairs and is seen as close to Union Minister Amit Shah who had made it clear that Rai would be given a \u201cbigger role\u201d. Rai\u2019s chances were boosted after BJP\u2019s Ram Kripal Yadav lost to RJD\u2019s Misa Bharti and he won from Ujiyarpur, defeating his nearest rival Alok Kumar Mehta of the RJD by more than 60,000 votes. Raj Bhushan Choudhary Also known as Raj Bhushan Nishad, the 46-year-old Mallah leader\u2019s inclusion into the Council of Ministers was no surprise. Nishad, who lost the 2019 polls from Muzaffarpur as a nominee of the Vikasheel Insaan Party (VIP), contested on a BJP ticket this time and defeated Congress candidate Ajay Nishad by more than 2.3 lakh votes. The Muzaffarpur MP is a doctor by profession and first set up his medical practice in Rosera in Samastipur. He switched to the BJP after the 2019 polls and was appointed state BJP vice-president as the party eyed Mallah and other allied castes\u2019 votes. Satish Chandra Dubey Dubey (49) is a Rajya Sabha MP and Brahmin leader from the Champaran region. He represented the Valmiki Nagar seat between 2014 and 2019. Dubey, who rose to prominence as a farm activist taking up the issues of sugarcane farmers, is seen to have pipped Darbhanga MP Gopalji Thakur, another Brahmin leader, to the ministerial post.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bjp-bihar-caste-calculus-two-new-faces-in-modi-govt-9382055/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/nityanand-pulse.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:44:35", "author": "Santosh Singh", "authors": ["Santosh Singh"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.311}

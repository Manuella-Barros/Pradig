Meehan, a prominent LGBTQ+ campaigner, is also the first openly gay man to be elected as a public representative in Donegal. He said he is humbled to be a part of history: \u201cI would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who came out and voted, to those who worked tirelessly on my campaign and to all those who came before, paving the way for me to stand here today as a proud gay man and a proud member of our community.\u201d Meehan ran a campaign that championed community development, social inclusion and rural regeneration.

He also spearheaded successful community integration projects following new arrivals of refugees into north Donegal. \u201cI am proud to be elected today to represent the interests of all people in our local area. At a time when we are seeing increasing divisions nationally, Friday\u2019s vote is a ringing endorsement of what we in Donegal all know; our community is welcoming and progressive \u2013 we are unified and not divided,\u201d said Meehan, this afternoon from the count in Letterkenny.

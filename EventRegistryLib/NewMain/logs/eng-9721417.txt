said Wednesday \"it's up to the president to decide\" if he should stay in the race despite President Joe Biden's insistence he is still running, showing how unsettled the question remains among prominent Democrats and Capitol Hill.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC.\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's imperiled candidacy, and her comments will be viewed as important for the party's direction as they weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nPressed on whether she personally wants Biden to stay on the top of the ticket as he has defiantly insisted he is staying in the race, Pelosi said, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do.\" The lack of a full endorsement from Pelosi for Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most, suggesting that despite the president's insistence he is not stepping aside, his party still has questions.\n\nPelosi said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and while foreign leaders are in Washington this week she encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\" Democrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the presidential debate with Trump last month and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden show voters he is up for another four-year term.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

The decision is the president's. I don't know what's happened to The New York Times that they make up news. It isn't true.\"\n\nIn the interview, Ms. Pelosi said she wanted to delay the conversations about Mr. Biden's future until after the NATO summit he is hosting this week in Washington, which on Thursday will include the president's first news conference since his disastrous debate performance, which raised questions about his mental acuity and fitness to remain in the race.\n\nBiden has remained defiant this week, penning a letter to House Democrats saying he's \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race.\n\nJUST IN: Joe Biden Remains Defiant, Sends Letter To Congressional Democrats Saying He's \"Firmly Committed\" To Race", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

Instead of a clear endorsement of the president's candidacy, viewers got another sign of disarray among Democrats as Pelosi stopped well short of voicing her support for Biden.\n\nAsked on Tuesday whether Biden is the best candidate to run against former President Donald Trump this cycle, Pelosi demurred. \"I'm not making any statement right now here in the hall,\" she told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"When I'm ready to make a statement I will.\" By Wednesday, she was seemingly ready to make such a statement with her appearance on MSNBC.\n\nAsked on \"Morning Joe\" whether Biden has her support to be the Democrat candidate at the top of the ticket in November, Pelosi refused to directly answer. \"As long as the president- it's up to the president to decide if he's going to run,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi emphasized.\n\nPelosi insisted that, among Democrats on the Hill at least, Biden is \"beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision.\" That's a far cry from saying people want him to remain in the race.\n\nPelosi was reminded that Biden has made his decision, defiantly stating -- repeatedly, in his ABC News interview and a letter to congressional Democrats -- that he was not stepping aside and would continue to run for president.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do and that's - that's the way it is,\" Pelosi reiterated, again refusing to answer the question of whether she believes Biden should remain in the race or supports his re-election bid.\n\nCiting this week's NATO summit in D.C., Pelosi urged Democrats to \"let [Biden] deal with\" the gathering of world leaders and \"hold off\" the pontificating -- for a day or two at least. \"I've said to everyone, let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately- but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nThat is, Pelosi still sees an opening for Democrats to jettison their own incumbent president from the ticket before November.\n\nNotably, Biden's \"Big Boy\" (the White House's description) press conference as part of the NATO summit on Thursday is seen as a test that the president needs to ace if he's going to quell concern within his party after a disastrous debate and less-than-inspiring interview with George Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe fact that Pelosi, formerly one of Biden's strongest allies on Capitol Hill through which he muscled massive spending bills through Congress, won't publicly back him is... not a good sign. It could be partly due to Pelosi's desire to stay relevant after being stripped of her gavel following the 2022 midterms -- everyone wants to know what she thinks about Biden's fitness, but if she tells them then the chase is over and reporters will move on to other lawmakers.\n\nWhile Biden might have hoped for a firm declaration of support from Pelosi, it sounds like she's as nervous as many other Democrats -- including multiple Democrat senators who this week said they don't believe Biden can win in November -- seeing round after round of post-debate polling showing Trump surging in swing states and among key voter groups. For lawmakers appearing down-ballot from Biden in November, the fears are real and growing.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, for example, just adjusted six of its state Electoral College ratings in Trump's direction including Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada -- triggering even more hand-wringing from Biden's fellow Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Spencer Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report_with_Amy_Walter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/97/781347ed-207d-430e-9ba7-ad0042b4f355.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president,\" Pelosi added.\n\nPelosi led House Democrats for the first two years of the Biden administration, helping pass some of his signature policy achievements such as the bipartisan infrastructure law and gun safety legislation. As a Democratic leader who has worked closely with Biden, Pelosi's thoughts on the president's ability to hold the office could carry a lot of weight in an election year where Biden's rematch with former President Donald Trump is expected to be a close race.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, in Biden's first post-debate television interview, repeatedly pressed the president what he would do if Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Pelosi were to tell him they were worried his presence in the race would impact the party's chances of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nBiden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\"\n\nSchumer on Tuesday largely declined to engage in questions on Biden's path forward, simply telling reporters multiple times: \"I'm with Joe.\"\n\nJeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward.\n\nSome described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Some described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance.\n\nAfter the meeting, a seventh House Democrat -- New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill -- publicly called on Biden to exit the race.\n\nSenate Democrats also met for their own conference meeting on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, during an interview with CNN, said during the meeting he expressed to colleagues his belief that Biden will not defeat Trump this November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this is not a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to ABC that Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown conveyed similar concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting. Brown and Tester are both facing difficult reelection campaigns of their own this cycle.\n\nThe Biden campaign pushed back on Bennet's comments, saying the race was always going to be close and is \"far from over.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2024/07/6ca918e53069a0617378e9609b00f990.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" rather than declaring Biden should stay in. While Biden has said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners showcasing his skills. His party at a crossroads, Biden faces the next national public test Thursday at a scheduled news conference that many Democrats in Congress will be watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly, even as she told ABC later she believes he can win. Her remarks came as actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nAnd Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters, \"I have complete confidence that Joe Biden will do the patriotic thing for the country. And he's going to make that decision.\"\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the president met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nThe president's team is sending senior Biden advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, and Biden Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon to meet with Democratic senators privately Thursday for a caucus lunch, according to both a Senate leadership aide and the Biden campaign.\n\nThere were some concerns, however, that it could backfire. One Democratic senator who requested anonymity to speak about the closed-door meeting said it could be a waste of time if Biden would not make the case to senators himself.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ocregister.com",

Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats met privately Tuesday, their first group meetings back in Washington since the debate. While seven House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nPodiatrist Specializing In Charcot Foot Reconstruction Comes to Lake Mary, Casselberry\n\n[Not Banned] Failed to Detect Location 12 Error Fixed by

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in February. \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said Wednesday. Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press\n\nIn a Wednesday morning interview, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., repeatedly urged President Biden to decide whether to stay in the presidential race, despite the president's insistence that he should remain at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \" ... He is beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision.\"\n\nBiden so far has been adamant that he should continue running for reelection, amid increasingly public concerns within the party about his candidacy after his halting performance against Donald Trump in the first debate of the contest last month. Biden has insisted that he is the best person to beat Trump, who he warned would usher in a radical right-wing agenda if allowed to return to the White House. On Wednesday, Biden has a full slate of events as host of this week's NATO summit in Washington, where dozens of world leaders are discussing, among other issues, how to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance should the former president be reelected.\n\nRelated Biden's support on Capitol Hill grimly uncertain. A seventh Democrat says he should drop out\n\nSince the debate, Biden has held campaign rallies, sat for an interview with ABC News, sent a lengthy letter to congressional lawmakers and agreed to hold a news conference Thursday, all in the hope of quelling doubts about his ability to serve a second term. Biden and his team also have met with key party leaders who have voiced strong support for his candidacy - including New York's Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, as well as members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nBut Pelosi's remarks in her TV appearance Wednesday suggested that Biden had yet to make a final decision about whether to continue running, and dissent within the party has continued to trickle out. Pressed on whether she wanted him to stay in the race, Pelosi said: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's - that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nPelosi also implied that she had told Democratic lawmakers to refrain from voicing any opinions about Biden's candidacy until after the NATO summit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Over 30 heads of state are here. ... It means [Biden is] orchestrating the discussion and setting the agenda, and he's doing so magnificently,\" Pelosi said. \"And I've said to everyone - let's just hold off whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I'm very proud of the president.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, Pelosi told a CBS News reporter that she thought Biden was \"great\" and that she never said Biden should \"reconsider\" his decision.\n\nIn an email Wednesday, Pelosi spokesman Ian Krager said: \"Speaker Pelosi fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do. We must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.\"\n\nRelated George Clooney and the growing celebrity revolt against Biden\n\nDemocratic lawmakers remain divided on Biden - and have certainly not remained quiet about their opinions on the president. So far, about a dozen Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., a moderate who represents a swing district, told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would be \"doing a grave disservice\" if he said Biden was the best Democratic candidate.\n\n\"For the good of our country, for my two young kids, I'm asking Joe Biden to step aside in the upcoming election and deliver on the promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders,\" Ryan told the Times.\n\nLate Tuesday, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told CNN that Trump was on track to win the election \"by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House\" if Biden remained in the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For me, this isn't a question about polling; it's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country,\" Bennet said. \"It's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nAsked to respond to Bennet's comments, Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said: \"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters. This was always going to be a close race.\"\n\nActor and filmmaker George Clooney, a longtime Biden supporter who has helped raise funds for the campaign, including in a major event last month in Los Angeles, published a guest op-ed in the New York Times on Wednesday calling for a new Democratic nominee.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nCNN political commentator Kate Bedingfield, who served as communications director for Biden's 2020 campaign and in the White House, suggested Wednesday that voters want to see data supporting the idea that Biden can win in November.\n\n\"I know firsthand better than almost anyone how smart the Biden team is about data and about ignoring the noise. They are right that the game here is to convince voters, not pundits,\" Bedingfield wrote on X. \"But when the battle over the public data is so overwhelmingly negative, it's a good moment to put forward your theory of the case. If they have data that supports the path to victory that they see, they should put it out there now and help people who badly want to beat Trump rally around it. People want to see the path.\"\n\nLiz Goodwin and Maeve Reston contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines George Clooney and the growing celebrity revolt against Biden Biden's support on Capitol Hill grimly uncertain.

Whatever he decides to go with.\"\n\n\"I said to everyone -- let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president,\" Pelosi added.\n\nThe Biden campaign's response to Pelosi's comments was, \"He's running.\"\n\nPelosi led House Democrats for the first two years of the Biden administration, helping pass some of his signature policy achievements such as the bipartisan infrastructure law and gun safety legislation. As a Democratic leader who has worked closely with Biden, Pelosi's thoughts on the president's ability to hold the office could carry a lot of weight in an election year where Biden's rematch with former President Donald Trump is expected to be a close contest.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, in Biden's first post-debate television interview, repeatedly pressed the president what he would do if Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Pelosi were to tell him they were worried his presence in the race would impact the party's chances of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nBiden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\"\n\nSchumer on Tuesday simply told reporters multiple times, \"I'm with Joe\" -- but declined to engage in broader questions on Biden's path forward.\n\nJeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward.\n\nSome members described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Others described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance.\n\nAfter the meeting, a seventh House Democrat -- New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill -- publicly called on Biden to exit the race.\n\nBut others, including Rep. Jerry Nadler and Rep. Jim Clyburn, expressed support for Biden.\n\n\"Right now, President Biden is the nominee. We support the Democratic nominee,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said at a press conference.\n\nSenate Democrats also met for their own conference meeting on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, during an interview with CNN, said in the meeting he expressed to colleagues his belief that Biden will not defeat Trump this November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this is not a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to ABC that Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown conveyed similar concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting. Brown and Tester are both facing difficult reelection campaigns of their own this cycle.\n\nThe Biden campaign pushed back on Bennet's comments, saying the race was always going to be close and is \"far from over.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person",

Movie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race. Clooney says in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden's imperiled re-election campaign hit new trouble Wednesday as House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said merely \"it's up to the president to decide\" if he should stay in the race, celebrity donor George Clooney said he should not run and Democratic senators and lawmakers expressed fresh fear about his ability to beat Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe sudden flurry of grave pronouncements despite Biden's determined insistence he is not leaving the 2024 race put on public display just how unsettled the question remains among prominent Democrats. On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC rather than declaring Biden should stay in. Though he's said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the president met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_mascaro@register-herald.com", "name": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Ryan (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Democrats are facing a choice: Whether to stick with Biden or call on him to drop out.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, appearing on MSNBC on Wednesday morning, declined to directly answer when asked if President Joe Biden had her support as he seeks reelection amid debate between Democrats on his viability as a candidate.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi told \"Morning Joe\" co-host Jonathan Lemire. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\n\"I think overwhelming support of the caucus -- it's not for me to say, I'm not the head of the caucus anymore -- but, he's beloved, he is respected and people want him to make that decision,\" Pelosi added.\n\nBiden, in a defiant statement to congressional Democrats on Monday, has said he's \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race to the end.\n\nLemire followed up by asking Pelosi directly, \"Do you want him to run?\"\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi responded. \"And that is the way it is. Whatever he decides to go with.\"\n\n\"I said to everyone -- let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president,\" Pelosi added.\n\nThe Biden campaign's response to Pelosi's comments was, \"He's running.\"\n\nPelosi led House Democrats for the first two years of the Biden administration, helping pass some of his signature policy achievements such as the bipartisan infrastructure law and gun safety legislation. As a Democratic leader who has worked closely with Biden, Pelosi's thoughts on the president's ability to hold the office could carry a lot of weight in an election year where Biden's rematch with former President Donald Trump is expected to be a close contest.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, in Biden's first post-debate television interview, repeatedly pressed the president what he would do if Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Pelosi were to tell him they were worried his presence in the race would impact the party's chances of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nMORE | Biden dismisses diminishing poll numbers, low approval rating after debate\n\nBiden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\"\n\nSchumer on Tuesday simply told reporters multiple times, \"I'm with Joe\" -- but declined to engage in broader questions on Biden's path forward.\n\nJeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward.\n\nSome members described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Others described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance.\n\nAfter the meeting, a seventh House Democrat -- New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill -- publicly called on Biden to exit the race.\n\nMORE | House Democrats huddle behind closed doors amid debate over Biden's path forward\n\nBut others, including Rep. Jerry Nadler and Rep. Jim Clyburn, expressed support for Biden.\n\n\"Right now, President Biden is the nominee. We support the Democratic nominee,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said at a press conference.\n\nSenate Democrats also met for their own conference meeting on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, during an interview with CNN, said in the meeting he expressed to colleagues his belief that Biden will not defeat Trump this November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this is not a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to ABC that Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown conveyed similar concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting. Brown and Tester are both facing difficult reelection campaigns of their own this cycle.\n\nThe Biden campaign pushed back on Bennet's comments, saying the race was always going to be close and is \"far from over.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "abc11 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Aguilar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Aguilar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15048654_joe-biden-nancy-pelosi-img.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC rather than declaring Biden should stay in. Though he's said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the president met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

It's a moral question about the future of our country.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden's imperiled re-election campaign hit new trouble Wednesday as House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said merely \"it's up to the President to decide\" if he should stay in the race, celebrity donor George Clooney said he should not run and Democratic Senators and lawmakers expressed fresh fear about his ability to beat Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe sudden flurry of grave pronouncements despite Biden's determined insistence he is not leaving the 2024 race put on public display just how unsettled the question remains among prominent Democrats. On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC rather than declaring Biden should stay in. Though he's said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the President and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for re-election.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the President to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House Speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the President's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the President last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the President \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private -- that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the President met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic Senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great President\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Whatever he decides to go with.\"\n\n\"I said to everyone -- let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president,\" Pelosi added.\n\nThe Biden campaign's response to Pelosi's comments was, \"He's running.\"\n\nPelosi led House Democrats for the first two years of the Biden administration, helping pass some of his signature policy achievements such as the bipartisan infrastructure law and gun safety legislation. As a Democratic leader who has worked closely with Biden, Pelosi's thoughts on the president's ability to hold the office could carry a lot of weight in an election year where Biden's rematch with former President Donald Trump is expected to be a close contest.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, in Biden's first post-debate television interview, repeatedly pressed the president what he would do if Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Pelosi were to tell him they were worried his presence in the race would impact the party's chances of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nMORE | Biden dismisses diminishing poll numbers, low approval rating after debate\n\nBiden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\"\n\nSchumer on Tuesday simply told reporters multiple times, \"I'm with Joe\" -- but declined to engage in broader questions on Biden's path forward.\n\nJeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward.\n\nSome members described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Others described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance.\n\nAfter the meeting, a seventh House Democrat -- New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill -- publicly called on Biden to exit the race.\n\nMORE | House Democrats huddle behind closed doors amid debate over Biden's path forward\n\nBut others, including Rep. Jerry Nadler and Rep. Jim Clyburn, expressed support for Biden.\n\n\"Right now, President Biden is the nominee. We support the Democratic nominee,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said at a press conference.\n\nSenate Democrats also met for their own conference meeting on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, during an interview with CNN, said in the meeting he expressed to colleagues his belief that Biden will not defeat Trump this November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this is not a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to ABC that Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown conveyed similar concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting. Brown and Tester are both facing difficult reelection campaigns of their own this cycle.\n\nThe Biden campaign pushed back on Bennet's comments, saying the race was always going to be close and is \"far from over.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Aguilar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Aguilar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15048654_joe-biden-nancy-pelosi-img.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC rather than declaring Biden should stay in. Though he's said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the president met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., from Marine One to attend a fundraiser in San Francisco on Wednesday Feb. 21. Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press file\n\nIn a Wednesday morning interview, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., repeatedly urged President Biden to decide whether to stay in the presidential race, despite the president's insistence that he should remain at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \" ... He is beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision.\"\n\nBiden so far has been adamant that he should continue running for reelection, amid increasingly public concerns within the party about his candidacy after his halting performance against Donald Trump in the first debate of the contest last month. Biden has insisted that he is the best person to beat Trump, who he warned would usher in a radical right-wing agenda if allowed to return to the White House. On Wednesday, Biden has a full slate of events as host of this week's NATO summit in Washington, where dozens of world leaders are discussing, among other issues, how to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance should the former president be reelected.\n\nSince the debate, Biden has held campaign rallies, sat for an interview with ABC News, sent a lengthy letter to congressional lawmakers and agreed to hold a news conference Thursday, all in the hope of quelling doubts about his ability to serve a second term. Biden and his team also have met with key party leaders who have voiced strong support for his candidacy - including New York's Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, as well as members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nBut Pelosi's remarks in her TV appearance Wednesday suggested that Biden had yet to make a final decision about whether to continue running, and dissent within the party has continued to trickle out. Pressed on whether she wanted him to stay in the race, Pelosi said: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's - that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nPelosi also implied that she had told Democratic lawmakers to refrain from voicing any opinions about Biden's candidacy until after the NATO summit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Over 30 heads of state are here. ... It means [Biden is] orchestrating the discussion and setting the agenda, and he's doing so magnificently,\" Pelosi said. \"And I've said to everyone - let's just hold off whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I'm very proud of the president.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, Pelosi told a CBS News reporter that she thought Biden was \"great\" and that she never said Biden should \"reconsider\" his decision.\n\nIn an email Wednesday, Pelosi spokesman Ian Krager said: \"Speaker Pelosi fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do. We must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers remain divided on Biden - and have certainly not remained quiet about their opinions on the president. So far, about a dozen Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., a moderate who represents a swing district, told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would be \"doing a grave disservice\" if he said Biden was the best Democratic candidate.\n\n\"For the good of our country, for my two young kids, I'm asking Joe Biden to step aside in the upcoming election and deliver on the promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders,\" Ryan told the Times.\n\nLate Tuesday, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told CNN that Trump was on track to win the election \"by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House\" if Biden remained in the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For me, this isn't a question about polling; it's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country,\" Bennet said. \"It's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nAsked to respond to Bennet's comments, Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said: \"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters. This was always going to be a close race.\"\n\nActor and filmmaker George Clooney, a longtime Biden supporter who has helped raise funds for the campaign, including in a major event last month in Los Angeles, published a guest op-ed in the New York Times on Wednesday calling for a new Democratic nominee.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nCNN political commentator Kate Bedingfield, who served as communications director for Biden's 2020 campaign and in the White House, suggested Wednesday that voters want to see data supporting the idea that Biden can win in November.\n\n\"I know firsthand better than almost anyone how smart the Biden team is about data and about ignoring the noise. They are right that the game here is to convince voters, not pundits,\" Bedingfield wrote on X. \"But when the battle over the public data is so overwhelmingly negative, it's a good moment to put forward your theory of the case. If they have data that supports the path to victory that they see, they should put it out there now and help people who badly want to beat Trump rally around it. People want to see the path.\"\n\nLiz Goodwin and Maeve Reston contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines George Clooney and the growing celebrity revolt against

We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running out.'\n\nReminded that Biden has made up his mind, Pelosi said: 'I want him to do whatever he decides to do.'\n\n'Whatever he decides, we go with.'\n\nIt comes as the typically united House Democrats have devolved into chaos with knives out for the leader of their party. As Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., put it, not only are Democrats not on the same page, 'we are not even in the same book.'\n\nNancy Pelosi said it is 'up to the president' to decide whether he wants to stay in the race but 'time is running out' in pointed comments Wednesday morning\n\nBiden wrote in a letter to hill Democrats on Tuesday: 'I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.'\n\nPelosi, 84, and Biden, 81, have crossed paths in Washington for decades. She's one typically of his biggest defenders on Capitol Hill.\n\nPelosi said Democrats should 'let him deal with the NATO conference' happening in Washington, D.C. this week and 'hold off' on public judgment 'until we see how we go this week.'\n\nThe remarks seemed to ignore the fact that President Biden has publicly insisted he's made his decision - he'll remain at the top of the Democratic ticket in November\n\nRead More Keir Starmer dodges questions about whether 81-year-old Joe Biden is too old to continue as US President\n\nPelosi was silent upon leaving an all-caucus meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday where they discussed the future of their presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nAsked about Pelosi's comments, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters he would not comment on them until he had spoken with her.\n\nDemocratic Whip Katherine Clark said of the remarks: 'Our view has not changed. President Biden is the nominee. There is no light between our caucus and the work we have done with this administration and the work that we will do in the future.

That was the question circulating after an early Wednesday appearance on MSNBC. It wasn't just Republicans pondering the thought either.\n\nAppearing on \"Morning Joe,\" Pelosi gave an extremely peculiar answer when asked about current calls for Joe Biden to step down. The president has been besieged by accusations about his mental competence after a disastrous debate performance in late June.\n\nPerhaps Pelosi was just exhibiting some of her own senility, but from her answer, it sure sounded like something was happening behind the scenes.\n\nLEMIRE: So Madam Speaker, you just went through the president's record, but let me ask you about the current moment. Does he have your support to be the head of the Democratic ticket?\n\nPELOSI: As long as the president has, it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. The, I think the overwhelming support of the caucus, it's not for me to say, I'm not the head of the cause anymore, but he's beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision, not me.\n\nLEMIRE: He has said, he has made the decision. He has said firmly this week that he is going to run. Do you want him to run?\n\nPELOSI: I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with. I think it's really important, and I would hope everyone would join in, to let him deal with this NATO conference. This is a very big deal. 30 heads, over 30 heads of state are here. He is the host of it, and that means not just hosting, but that means orchestrating the agenda, and he's doing so magnificently.\n\nAnd I say to everyone, let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell someone privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\n\nThat clip is absolutely wild. Pelosi seems unaware that Biden has already pledged to stay in the race multiple times since the debate. Yet, when it's pointed out to her that he's already made that decision, she doubles down, stating that the issue should be picked back up after \"we see how we go this week.\"\n\nSEE: Joe Biden Gives Definitive Answer About His Future, and Democrats Are Going to Need a Stiff Drink\n\nI mean, what? Talk about knee-capping your own candidate. Even Democrats were perplexed by her answer.\n\nThere are a few possibilities here. One is that Pelosi is just old and doesn't comprehend that Biden has already made his decision. Another is that she's not-so-gently nudging the president to reconsider staying in the race, which is astonishing given the tensions within the party. Then there's the possibility that Pelosi does know something we don't and that some kind of surprise move is coming, whether that be Biden dropping out or him being forced out.\n\nRegardless of the reason, everything seems to hinge on the president's \"big boy\" press conference on Friday. As RedState reported, Democrats have set that as the deadline to have Biden out of the race. If he flubs that presser despite how low the bar is already set, the rush to get him out of the race will be overwhelming. Pelosi seems to be hedging her bets, waiting to see how he performs.\n\nThe fact that a major Democrat leader (who has been given the fake title \"Speaker Emerita\") won't just commit to Biden being the nominee at this stage is pretty incredible. The longer this festers, the lower the president's chances of winning re-election become. That Pelosi and others know the stakes are still not willing to speak with confidence about Biden's future is telling.

On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC rather than declaring Biden should stay in. Though he's said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable - having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the president met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As a Democratic leader who has worked closely with Biden, Pelosi's thoughts on the president's ability to hold the office could carry a lot of weight in an election year where Biden's rematch with former President Donald Trump is expected to be a close race.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, in Biden's first post-debate television interview, repeatedly pressed the president what he would do if Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Pelosi were to tell him they were worried his presence in the race would impact the party's chances of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nBiden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\"\n\nSchumer on Tuesday largely declined to engage in questions on Biden's path forward, simply telling reporters multiple times: \"I'm with Joe.\"\n\nJeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward.\n\nSome described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Some described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance.\n\nAfter the meeting, a seventh House Democrat -- New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill -- publicly called on Biden to exit the race.\n\nSenate Democrats also met for their own conference meeting on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, during an interview with CNN, said during the meeting he expressed to colleagues his belief that Biden will not defeat Trump this November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this is not a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to ABC that Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown conveyed similar concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting.

On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside.\n\nLamont: Biden should go on the offensive about his health\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC rather than declaring Biden should stay in. Though he's said repeatedly that he's made his decision, she said, \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.", "source": {"uri": "rep-am.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republican American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_lewis@rep-am.com", "name": "Lee Lewis", "type":

But the California congresswoman notably stopped short of saying she thought Biden should continue his reelection bid, instead offering a decidedly mixed, yet clear, message that he should reconsider.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi said.\n\nShe continued, \"He is beloved. He is respected. And people want him to make that decision, not me.\"\n\nBiden made it clear earlier this week that he has, in fact, made his decision, sending a letter to congressional Democrats stating that he has no plans of dropping out and that he's the strongest possible candidate to run against Donald Trump. The president followed up his statement by calling in to Morning Joe -- which Pelosi knows he watches religiously -- daring his critics to challenge him at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nPelosi also suggested that members of the party wait to address the question of Biden's fitness while the eyes of the world are on the president as he hosts the NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., adding that he's doing so \"magnificently.\" \"Let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" she said.\n\nWhen pressed on whether she wants Biden to run, Pelosi once again deferred to the president. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do and that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with,\" she said.\n\nPelosi's comments mark a strong contrast from other leaders in the Democratic Party, who have offered either full-throated or medium-throated support of Biden. On Monday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that he is still backing the president. \"I made clear publicly the day after the debate that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket. My position has not changed,\" he said. Since Biden's disastrous debate performance last month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has repeated one consistent refrain when asked whether he should step aside: \"I'm with Joe.\"\n\nJim Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman and former House majority whip whose 2020 endorsement played a key role in Biden's eventual win, has also stood by the president among the calls by some party members for him to drop out. \"We're riding with Biden,\" he said following the House Democrats caucus meeting Tuesday morning.\n\nHowever, Pelosi's remarks demonstrate that there's still some uneasiness within the Democratic Party despite the many members who have voiced their support of Biden in recent days. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Senator Michael Bennet confirmed that he said in a closed-door caucus meeting that Biden will likely lose in November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" he said. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country, and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on a path to electing Donald Trump again.\"", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_prater@nymag.com", "name": "Nia Prater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/807/29a/163bb7848262bbdd61e658ad23f49f504d-Nancy-Pelosi.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He's seeking to quell a rebellion from lawmakers, donors and other prominent figures in the party who have called for him to step aside and allow a new candidate to take on Trump.\n\nread more Actor, Democratic donor George Clooney urges Biden to end campaign NATO summit: Biden shores up support but doubts remain among some Democrats White House dodges questions over Parkinson's doctor, says Biden is fine Fresh round of hazards: This week absolutely critical for Biden, says Senator Chris Murphy\n\nBiden reiterated his intention to remain in the race again hours after Pelosi's comments, telling labour leaders gathered in Washington he was \"staying\" atop the ticket.\n\nThe outcry, though, extended to one of the party's biggest celebrity supporters and donors, George Clooney, who called for a new nominee Wednesday just a few weeks after he attended a fundraiser with Biden.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed, adding that Biden, at the fundraiser, was \"the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said he had spoken to senators, members of the House, and governors about his concern - and that \"every single one\" believed Democrats would lose control of both chambers of Congress.\n\n'Hold off'\n\nPelosi urged lawmakers not to publicly air their concerns about the president until the NATO summit being held in Washington concludes. Biden is expected to hold a high-stakes news conference Thursday afternoon, while foreign allies attending the event are closely watching the US president.\n\n\"I said to everyone, let's just hold off - whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe poor debate performance from Biden, 81, raised worried about the fitness and mental acuity of the already oldest US president in history to defeat Trump and serve another four-year term. Those worries have been amplified by fears that a weak presidential candidate at the top of the ticket could wreck Democratic hopes of retaking the House and holding onto Senate control.\n\nThe issue even came up as Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell testified on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Powell said that while he had not met with Biden for years, he had not seen cognitive decline in the president.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll after the debate found Trump ahead of Biden by six percentage points and Democratic worries intensified on Tuesday after the Cook Political Report updated their Electoral College analysis to show a more favourable map for the Republican candidate.\n\nStill, many prominent Democrats have been reluctant to outright call on Biden to exit the race. In the hours after her MSNBC comments, Pelosi told CBS News she had not intended to signal Biden \"should reconsider his decision.\"\n\nShe subsequently released a statement saying Democrats \"must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.\"\n\nJim Clyburn, a South Carolina congressman who has long championed Biden in Democratic politics, said he would ask Pelosi what she meant by her remarks.\n\n\"I'm still riding with Biden,\" he added.\n\nNew defection\n\nBut Pelosi's comments were followed by another Democratic lawmaker - Pat Ryan, a congressman from New York - calling on Biden to step aside.\n\n\"I'd be doing a grave disservice if I said he was the best candidate to serve this fall,\" Ryan told the New York Times. \"I'm asking Joe Biden to step aside in the upcoming election and deliver on the promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.\"\n\nOther prominent Democratic lawmakers simply echoed Pelosi's tepid support. Katherine Clark, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Biden is the party's nominee but like Pelosi did not explicitly stand behind him.\n\n\"As always this decision is up to the president,\" Clark said.\n\nRitchie Torres, a Democratic congressman from New York, said \"there must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\" nodding to the risk that an unpopular Biden could drag down House and Senate candidates.\n\n\"What matters is not how we feel but what the numbers tell us,\" Torres said in a written statement Wednesday.\n\nKate Bedingfield, who was Biden's deputy campaign manager in 2020, said the president's current team needed to demonstrate that the president still has a viable path to victory.\n\n\"If they have data that supports the path to victory that they see, they should put it out there now,\" Bedingfield wrote on X.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) indicated President Biden's political fate remained an open question, while pressing colleagues to hold off on any judgments until after this week's North Atlantic Treaty Organization conference concludes.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run,\" Pelosi said in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\n\nBiden has said repeatedly and forcefully in the past week that he plans to stay in the race against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, in the face of mounting questions about whether he can win and serve another term. With her comments, Pelosi is joining many Democrats who, while stopping short of saying he should leave, have signaled he should continue to think about his decision to stay in the race. To date, only seven House Democrats, and no senators, have called on him to step aside.\n\n\"I've said to everyone, 'let's just hold off,'\" Pelosi said. \"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\" She also praised the president, saying he \"is beloved, he is respected\" by Democratic colleagues.\n\nPelosi worked closely with Biden during his first two years in office. While no longer leading the party, she remains a prominent and influential figure.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill discussed the president's candidacy in closed-door caucus meetings on Tuesday, and some members remain unconvinced that Biden should stay in the race. Many lawmakers are increasingly doubtful he can win, and fear he could drag House and Senate candidates down with him. Two people familiar with internal House Democratic discussions said they expected the number of people calling for Biden to step down to soon increase.\n\nThere is no clear means of replacing Biden atop the ticket unless he decides to drop out of the race, given that he controls almost all of the party's delegates thanks to sweeping the primaries earlier this year. If he were to step aside, Democrats would have to quickly coalesce around a new nominee, also a tall order.\n\n\"Right now, President Biden is the nominee, and we support the Democratic nominee that will beat Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.), a member of party leadership, said Tuesday. \"Let's see. Let's see the press conference. Let's see the campaign stops. Let's see all of this, because all of it is going to be necessary.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) told colleagues in their meeting that he didn't think Biden would prevail this fall. Speaking to CNN, he said he thinks Trump is on track to \"maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House.\" But he declined to say Biden should step aside.\n\nSome members skeptical of the president's candidacy spoke at caucus meetings on Tuesday, including Rep. Seth Moulton (D., Mass.), who has called for Biden to step aside.\n\n\"Everyone was listening very carefully to the variety of positions in the room, and it's exactly the kind of debate and discussion that we should be having as a party,\" Moulton told reporters. \"This is what democracy is about.\"\n\nPelosi, who worked with Biden on major legislation including his infrastructure law and sweeping climate package as speaker, has been a steadfast supporter of the president. She noted that he has a jam-packed schedule this week as world leaders descend on Washington for the NATO summit.\n\nBiden spoke to NATO leaders Tuesday night for the summit's opening ceremony. It was the latest in a string of appearances under heavy scrutiny from the public, as the president works to convince voters that he can deliver a strong message after his disastrous debate performance in June.\n\nPelosi heaped praise on Biden for the address. \"He was absolutely spectacular,\" she said.\n\nThe president has received notable backing from members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and progressives, as well as longtime allies who point to his legislative accomplishments during his first term in office.\n\n\"He has to make a decision,\" said Rep. Julia Brownley (D., Calif.). \"You could say he's already made a decision. Is that a final decision? If it is, then I don't think there's another alternative.\"\n\nWrite to Owen Tucker-Smith at Owen.Tucker-Smith@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Aguilar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Aguilar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Moulton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Moulton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Hispanic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Brownley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julia Brownley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-978167/social", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The staunch ally of the 81-year-old president ignored his insistence he will be taking on Donald Trump in November and hinted he should reconsider the decision.\n\nAsked if Biden has her support on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the former speaker said: 'It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running out.'\n\nReminded that Biden has made up his mind, Pelosi said: 'I want him to do whatever he decides to do.' 'Whatever he decides, we go with.'\n\nIt comes as the typically united House Democrats have devolved into chaos with knives out for the leader of their party. As Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., put it, not only are Democrats not on the same page, 'we are not even in the same book.'\n\nBiden wrote in a letter to hill Democrats on Tuesday: 'I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump .'\n\nPelosi, 84, and Biden, 81, have crossed paths in Washington for decades. She's one typically of his biggest defenders on Capitol Hill. Pelosi said Democrats should 'let him deal with the NATO conference' happening in Washington, D.C. this week and 'hold off' on public judgment 'until we see how we go this week.'\n\nPelosi was silent upon leaving an all-caucus meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday where they discussed the future of their presumptive presidential nominee. Asked about Pelosi's comments, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters he would not comment on them until he had spoken with her.\n\nDemocratic Whip Katherine Clark said of the remarks: 'Our view has not changed. President Biden is the nominee. There is no light between our caucus and the work we have done with this administration and the work that we will do in the future. As always, this decision is up to the president.' So far at least seven House Democrats have demanded Biden step aside in on-the-record statements. Others have flirted with the idea or expressed a similar sentiment behind closed doors.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said he believes Biden will lose Democrats the election on Tuesday. 'Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,' Bennet said. 'I think that we could lose the whole thing,' he told CNN.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Jim Clyburn (D-SC), a congressional confidante of the president.\n\nSeveral swing-state Democrats nervous about competitive races had a vent session before the meeting that resulted in \"actual tears,\" one lawmaker spilled to Axios on Tuesday, and a recognition that Biden would \"stay in -- which sucks for our country.\"\n\n\"As someone who wanted the reckoning and is really disappointed that it's over, trust me: it's over,\" another House Democrat told the outlet.\n\nOnly seven Democratic members of Congress have come out against the oldest-ever president, urging their party to reconsider before a potentially disastrous electoral outcome up and down the ballot in November.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pelosi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2014, "textEnd": 2021}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nPelosi also commented about Biden earlier this week, saying, \"I've always been committed to him,\" The Hill reported.\n\n\"I'm not making any statement right now here in the hall. When I'm ready to make a statement I will,\" Pelosi said.\n\nJoshua Darr, an associate professor of political communications at Syracuse University, told Newsweek that \"Pelosi's plea for Biden to decide is at odds with his clear statements that the only way he's dropping out is if 'the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me to.' I can't know what she's thinking, but I doubt she'd still be imploring him to decide if he'd come to the decision she thought was best.\"\n\nPelosi's comments brought responses across social media as Biden continues to face concerns about his age and mental acuity following his performance in his recent debate with Donald Trump. Biden has vowed to stay in the race despite some members of his party calling on him to step aside.\n\n\"This statement from Pelosi is earth shaking. Hardly an endorsement of Biden from congress's most prominent Democrat,\" Jake Sherman, the founder of Punchbowl News, wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nJournalist Jamie Dupree wrote, \"The fact that Pelosi doesn't automatically say, 'Yes, Biden should run' is a giant [alarm].\"\n\nConservative commentator Steve Cortes said, \"Wow. Nancy Pelosi still won't back Joe Biden.\"\n\nPolitico reporter Daniella Diaz said, \"Rank-and-file have been watching Pelosi/Clyburn/Jeffries very closely to see how they'll handle Biden, as we've repeatedly reported...This could sway some folks to speak out...\"\n\nAnthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University College of Law, wrote, \"When you closely study American politics over time, one thing is always clear: messaging is the most important thing for representatives and senators. Position-taking is everything. Sometimes, slips are slips. But paying attention to the subtleties matters.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Pelosi's office and Biden's campaign via email for comment.\n\nOn Monday, Biden sent a letter to House Democrats that said, \"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end.\"\n\nHe went on: \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nDarr said that Pelosi is \"right that time is running out, and Biden is probably happy to run out the clock.\"\n\n\"If the NATO press conference Thursday goes poorly for Biden, that might lead more Democratic officials to take the leap,\" he continued. \"Pelosi's hesitation leaves the door open for those who want to speak out, without clearly staking out her own opinion.

That's About It", "body": "A ringing endorsement of Joe Biden for President this is not. Biden has already decided to stay in the race, and sent a rather emphatic letter to Congress on Monday to that effect. Or at least someone at the White House did, under his signature, although Biden had said the same publicly for several days prior to that as well.\n\nEither Nancy Pelosi literally didn't get the memo, or she didn't like the decision. Appearing on Morning Joe earlier today, Pelosi emphasied that she supports whatever Biden decides about the 2024 race. When confronted by the fact that Biden has already decided to stay in, Pelosi continues to endorse ... Biden's ability to decide whether to stay.\n\nHuh?\n\nThe translation appears to be: I will fully support whatever decision you make as long as you make the decision I can support. Whatever Pelosi actually meant with this word salad, she clearly doesn't mean that she supports Biden staying in the presidential race. She wants to leave the decision window open even after hearing Biden's declaration to retain his party's nomination.\n\nWhat does that tell you about Democrat enthusiasm heading into the Chicago convention?\n\nFox & Friends did their own translation shortly afterward, via Mediaite:\n\nJONES: I tell you at I think it means, no one more precise with words than Nancy Pelosi. She knows exactly what she's saying.\n\nKILMEADE: Even when she slurs them.\n\nJONES: The translation is: 'We have encouraged him behind the scenes to step aside but whatever he wants to do, if he's staying in it, we're with him.' And that is what's been happening behind the scenes. This is cover for the Democrats that have been causing a stir.\n\nEven Politico got caught off-guard by Pelosi's dodge. What happened to \"full confidence,\" they wondered:\n\nPelosi previously expressed \"full confidence\" in Biden, and she spoke glowingly of his record in office on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt briefly seemed like Biden's team had weathered much of the political storm on Tuesday -- Senate Democrats were mum after a 'family discussion' on the president's viability, and no flood of new calls for the incumbent to step aside materialized from the House side.\n\nBut Pelosi's comments come after Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) went public with his private concerns late Tuesday, telling CNN former President Donald Trump could win this fall in a \"landslide\" and that the Biden White House has done \"nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nSeven House Democrats have called on Biden to withdraw, and haven't changed their position since. Biden's firm declaration appears to have stanched the bleeding, even while not impressing Pelosi, but that may also be temporary. The Wall Street Journal reports that more are waiting to see any more evidence of incompetence:\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), who said in a private call of Democratic leaders on Sunday that he would like Biden to be replaced, said Tuesday that his concerns remain but that those are \"beside the point\" now.\n\nStill, Democratic lawmakers who are sticking with Biden acknowledge they are somewhat stuck on a hamster wheel, potentially facing more moments of Biden stumbles throughout the campaign. Biden has acknowledged he had a bad debate performance, and subsequent interviews and conversations haven't put an end to worries that he will falter again.\n\nTwo people familiar with internal House Democratic discussions said they expected the number of people calling for Biden to step down to soon increase.\n\nStay tuned for Biden's upcoming \"big boy press conference,\" presumably either tomorrow or Friday.

I can't know what she's thinking, but I doubt she'd still be imploring him to decide if he'd come to the decision she thought was best.\"\n\nPelosi's comments brought responses across social media as Biden continues to face concerns about his age and mental acuity following his performance in his recent debate with Donald Trump. Biden has vowed to stay in the race despite some members of his party calling on him to step aside.\n\n\"This statement from Pelosi is earth shaking. Hardly an endorsement of Biden from congress's most prominent Democrat,\" Jake Sherman, the founder of PunchBowl News, wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nJournalist Jamie Dupree wrote, \"The fact that Pelosi doesn't automatically say, 'Yes, Biden should run' is a giant [alarm].\"\n\nConservative commentator Steve Cortes said, \"Wow. Nancy Pelosi still won't back Joe Biden.\"\n\nPolitico reporter Daniella Diaz said, \"Rank-and-file have been watching Pelosi/Clyburn/Jeffries very closely to see how they'll handle Biden, as we've repeatedly reported...This could sway some folks to speak out...\"\n\nAnthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University College of Law, wrote, \"When you closely study American politics over time, one thing is always clear: messaging is the most important thing for representatives and senators. Position-taking is everything. Sometimes, slips are slips. But paying attention to the subtleties matters.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Pelosi's office and Biden's campaign via email for comment.\n\nOn Monday, Biden sent a letter to House Democrats saying, \"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end.\"\n\nHe went on: \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nDarr said that Pelosi is \"right that time is running out, and Biden is probably happy to run out the clock.\"\n\n\"If the NATO press conference Thursday goes poorly for Biden, that might lead more Democratic officials to take the leap,\" he continued. \"Pelosi's hesitation leaves the door open for those who want to speak out, without clearly staking out her own opinion. Future statements may need to be clearer if Biden is going to feel real pressure from his party,\" Darr.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_impelli@kansascity.com", "name": "Matthew Impelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Tecumseh Sherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University_College_of_Law", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University College of Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/kde067/picture289919954/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/521a53d9-92c7-4295-88b6-31fb610e803e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Michael Bennet of Colorado on Tuesday night expressed doubt that the president will be able to beat former President Donald Trump in November, in the most critical comments made publicly by a Senate Democrat so far in the aftermath of the debate.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said on CNN, though he stopped short of calling on Mr. Biden to step aside.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat pointed to where the president stands in polls at this point, as compared to where he stood against Trump at this time in 2020, as well as where Hillary Clinton stood against Trump in 2016, saying \"this race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome.\"\n\nExplaining why he isn't calling on the president to step aside, Bennet said that \"we're all here this week, to have this discussion, to have this debate,\" about the president's prospects, though he added that the White House has \"done nothing\" to demonstrate a plan to win the election following the debate.\n\nThe comments come after congressional Democrats met on Tuesday, following a July 4 holiday recess that kept them out of Washington since the debate last month. House Democrats met Tuesday morning for what one member described as a \"listening session.\" And Senate Democrats held a lengthy meeting Tuesday afternoon that left some touting unity within the caucus, though most remained tight-lipped about the details of the meeting. Neither meeting appeared to yield a path forward for the party.\n\nParticularly in the Senate, Democrats have adopted a wait-and-see approach, with no Senate Democrats having publicly called for the president to step aside. Instead, a number of Democrats, like Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, have outlined that they want to see more from the president, saying he \"must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nOutside of the Capitol, another admission about the president's ability to serve another term made waves late Tuesday, when a video surfaced from TMZ showing ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos saying about the president that \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\" Stephanopoulos conducted the first interview of the president last week since his debate about the path forward.\n\nThen, actor George Clooney, who hosted a fundraiser for the Biden campaign just last month, penned an op-ed released Wednesday calling on Mr. Biden to step aside.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote, adding that \"our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw.\"\n\nClooney said Democrats have \"a very exciting bench,\" while making a push to hear from possible replacements like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among others. And he urged that \"the scary stories that we're being told about what would happen next are simply not true,\" arguing that the money \"in the Biden-Harris coffers\" could go toward the Democratic ticket more broadly.\n\nThe actor urged top Democrats in Congress to ask the president to voluntarily step aside, claiming that the party is \"not going to win in November with this president,\" while arguing that control of the House and Senate are also threatened. He noted that \"every senator and congress member and governor\" that he's spoken with in private agrees, \"irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nThe developments come as top Democrats have continued to back the president, albeit with reserved statements of support. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries reiterated his support for the president this week, saying, \"I made clear publicly the day after the debate that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket.

He's made that crystal clear multiple times in his interview with George Stephanopoulos, his letter to congressional Democrats, and plenty of times during campaign events. If we take Biden at his word, which admittedly doesn't mean much, he's in it to win it.\n\nBut does former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi know something that we don't? Despite Biden's public assurances that he's staying in the race, Nancy Pelosi's appearance on MSNBC Wednesday is raising doubts and has many speculating that she knows something that the public isn't privy to.\n\nDuring her appearance on MSNBC, Pelosi appeared to imply inside knowledge of things going on behind the scenes that conflict with Biden's public statements about staying in the race.\n\n\"So Madam Speaker, you just went through the president's record, but let me ask you about the current moment. Does he have your support to be the head of the Democratic ticket?\" asked MSNBC's Jonathan Lemire.\n\n\"As long as the president has -- it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. The, I think, overwhelming support of the caucus, it's not for me to say. I'm not the head of the caucus anymore, but he's beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision, not me.\"\n\nThe main problem with this response is that Biden has stated multiple times that he is staying in the race. It's hard to believe that Pelosi didn't know that; Lemire even pointed it out.\n\n\"He has said -- he has made the decision,\" he told Pelosi. \"He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run?\"\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's the way it is,\" she said.\n\nThen she suggested that a decision still hasn't been made yet: \"Whatever he decides, we go with. I think it's really important, and I would hope everyone would join in, to let him deal with this NATO conference. This is a very big deal. 30 heads, over 30, heads of state are here. He is the host of it, and that means not just hosting, but that means orchestrating the discussion and setting the agenda, and he's doing so magnificently.\"\n\nShe added, \"And I've said to everyone, let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell someone privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nHold the phone here. Is something about to happen this week? Pelosi can't claim to have been unaware that Biden already said he was staying, especially after Lemire told her as much. She seems to be under the impression that something is about to happen this week.\n\nSpeculation is understandably rampant on social media. That said, while her remarks don't mean that Biden is going to drop out, it does suggest she might know that he hasn't made a true decision. If I might be allowed to speculate, the real discussion may be about how Biden can leave the race while maintaining some dignity in the process.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/182/60781436-717b-4fa9-b217-f64888469da9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" Pelosi said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, when Scott sought to question the former speaker what she has said to Biden directly, Pelosi responded, \"I'm not having this conversation with you or anybody else about what I talk with the president about, with all due respect. I never do.\"\n\nScott followed up wondering about Biden waiting so long to make his decision, before Pelosi cut her off.\n\n\"I'm not going to be making any comments in the hallway about the fate of our nation, okay?\" she said.\n\nUndeterred, Scott asked, \"Are you concerned whether he can win in November?\"\n\nPelosi quickly replied, \"I think he can win in November.\"\n\nFinally came the question that apparently broke the camel's back: \"Do you think he should run for reelection?\"\n\nPelosi stopped walking and looked Scott squarely in the face and said, \"Am I speaking English to you? I'm not going to be making any statements about any of that right now in the hallway.\"\n\nIn her video post on X about the exchange, Scott wrote out Pelosi's snarky response.\n\nOne responded to Scott's post, \"Speaking English\"...!?!? Very inappropriate and disrespectful.\"\n\nAnother wrote, concerning Pelosi: \"If she were a Republican... she'd be an evil racist for treating for questioning your ability to understand English.\"\n\nAnd that's likely true, because the establishment media is always looking for any soundbite to fit the narrative that Republicans are racists. Certainly questioning a minority reporter's ability to understand English would fit that bill.\n\nPelosi probably didn't mean her response in that way. It's a common phrase, certainly from back in the day, when someone doesn't seem to comprehend what you're saying to them.\n\nPelosi was clearly trying to voice her frustration with the correspondent's unrelenting questioning, but it's worth noting you're not likely to see widespread coverage accusing her of being a racist because of it, perhaps just some saying she was a little mean.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "randy_desoto@westernjournal.com", "name": "Randy DeSoto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pelosi-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman joins Catalysts to discuss the NATO Summit and Biden's future ahead of the November election.\n\nNewman explains that this NATO meeting is especially important as Russia makes advances in its war against Ukraine. He points out that President Biden gave forceful remarks on Tuesday about Russia without fumbling any of his words. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the latest voice to weigh in on Biden's future as the Democratic nominee as concerns about his age and cognitive abilities mount. Pelosi is a critical figurehead in the Democratic Party, adding to the already heated pressure facing the president.\n\nWhile Biden has reiterated that he's staying in the race, Newman explains that Democrats have until the Democratic National Convention mid-August to solidify their nominee.\n\nAll eyes are on him as he leads the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nDemocrats are divided, though, about what the president should do next.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this morning saying quote, It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run.\n\nWe are all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short notice.\n\nShe did not say which way on that decision.\n\nSo joining us now with the latest on the campaign We've got our very Rick Newman.\n\nThank you so much for joining us here.\n\nObviously, this is a really important week with NATO members in Washington.\n\nTo what extent is some of the commentary around Biden's campaign like that from former Speaker Pelosi?\n\nKind of clouding the ability of these NATO leaders to be able to get anything done here.\n\nIt is certainly clouding what's going on with the NATO meeting.\n\nThe NATO meeting is really important, mainly because of Russia's war in Ukraine and the need for NATO to demonstrate that it has the credibility and the power to stand up to Russian military advances in Eastern Europe.\n\nBiden you know, he has been the leader of that effort, and he yesterday he got credit for making a forceful speech, pushing back on, uh, on Russia and saying There's no chance they will win.\n\nAnd commentators pointed out that Wow, he got through a whole speech without fumbling any words.\n\nI mean that that's not the way you want your speech to land when you're talking about stuff like this.\n\nSo, um, I mean, but Biden, in a way, he he kind of seems like a lame duck president, almost which would, which would be a president who is on his way out and is, you know, in the last couple of months of his presidency now, Biden, of course, says no, That's not the case at all.\n\nSo listen to the tone of what Nancy Pelosi said there.\n\nUm, what everybody has been watching for has been what a few of the key sort of kingmaker Democrats are going to say about Biden's predicament.\n\nAnd Nancy Pelosi is one of those crucial Democrats, and she is now kind of saying, maybe Biden should think about stepping back.\n\nI mean, she said Biden needs to decide.\n\nBiden would say, I've already decided I'm in this race.\n\nThat's what he keeps telling us everybody.\n\nAnd Nancy Pelosi now today says, Well, he needs to think this through and tell us what he decides as if Well, maybe he hasn't really made up his mind.\n\nI mean, this is the Democrats have a couple of weeks to get this straightened out, But by the time we get into late August, when their convention is in for sure September when the election is going to be in the final stretches Democrats need to have a candidate.\n\nThey are all behind.\n\nAnd put all this drama about whether Biden should be in or not behind them.\n\nWell, we've been asking guests all week about the possibility of President Biden, uh, stepping aside in the race.\n\nHe's ventures founder and CEO and asked him about the possibility of President Biden withdrawing from the presidential race.\n\nI want to play this clip and then get your reaction on the other side.\n\nI would tell him to step down or to he doesn't have to withdraw.\n\nActually, the best thing he could do If he said if he said to me, it's really important that if it's not me, it be Harris, then you should actually resign and let her be president and have that that peak and purview.\n\nAssuming he doesn't really care about that, the next best thing would be for him to withdraw from the race.\n\nHe can endorse her, or he can say, We're gonna have an open convention.\n\nEither way, he doesn't have the power to pick the successor either way and like to me, the one caveat or carrot you could offer him.\n\nI was like, Look, now you can pardon Hunter.\n\nSo if you are, because the odds of him now winning this election feel very, very low.\n\nI'm curious just on your thought there of what we just heard from Tusk.\n\nAnd then also just this.\n\nThe talk here that Vice President Harris would likely be, uh, the Democratic, the Democratic nominee if President Biden were to step aside.\n\nWell, I mean, everybody has an opinion on this, and it's not just should Biden stay in the race or should he not stay in the race?\n\nBut should he resign as a candidate, a lot of people think he should.\n\nAnd if he does resign, then what happens?\n\nDoes he sort of anoint Kamala Harris the vice president, or does he endorse anybody?\n\nOr how do they actually figure out who the candidate is?\n\nHis insights are interesting because he helped run Mike Bloomberg's campaigns.\n\nBut Mike Bloomberg was a Republican and then an independent mayor of New York City, and he also worked in the Senate on the Democratic side.\n\nSo he he has insights into this.\n\nBut, um, there there's just a whole range of possibilities and what we've been seeing since that horrible debate by Biden on June 27th is there there?\n\nThe Democrats are not coalescing on any one of these options.\n\nSo, um, you know the story two days ago or one day ago was that Biden seemed to be kind of bouncing back.\n\nHe has beaten back a lot of these calls for him to drop out, and and then people like a OC the squad member in the House, she said, I'm with Biden, so it seemed like he was getting a little more support.\n\nBut now, as we just discussed, Nancy Pelosi comes on TV and says, Well, maybe he need basically says, I'm paraphrasing.\n\nMaybe he needs to think about dropping out.\n\nSo there's just no consensus forming among Democrats and people giving their opinion is not leading anywhere.\n\nIt's just leading to like a squall of multifarious opinions blowing in every direction.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Some of Biden's Democratic colleagues are not sure he can defeat Trump, however, and they are treating his decision to keep campaigning as a question yet to be decided.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives and still an influential voice in Democratic circles, on Wednesday was the latest to express less than certainty that Biden will be the Democratic standard bearer in the November 5 election.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi told MSNBC. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. He's beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision. Not me.\"\n\nA news anchor noted that Biden \"has made the decision. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run?\"\n\nPelosi responded, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's -- that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nBiden has vowed to stay in the race, saying that only \"the Lord Almighty\" asking him to end his campaign could force him out and urging Democratic lawmakers earlier this week to quickly get behind his campaign and end the drama over whether he might drop out.\n\nEleven of the 213 Democrats in the House of Representatives, but none in the Senate, have called on the 81-year-old Biden to withdraw from his campaign, with Vice President Kamala Harris possibly replacing him as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nBut many more Democratic lawmakers have voiced concern whether Biden has the mental acuity and physical stamina to defeat Trump a second time, let alone serve for another four years as president, after stumbling badly and often losing his train of thought in their late June debate. Trump has edged ahead of Biden in national polling and in key political battleground states that are crucial to both candidates.\n\nActor George Clooney, who co-hosted a massive Hollywood fundraiser for Biden last month, on Wednesday was the latest Democratic supporter of the president to call for him to end his run for a new term in the White House starting next January, saying in a New York Times opinion piece that Biden had declined physically and mentally.\n\nSaying \"the dam has broken,\" Clooney wrote, \"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\n\"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside,\" Clooney said.\n\nDemocratic senators and House members met separately behind closed doors on Tuesday, some voicing support for Biden staying in the race, a handful in the House calling for him to end his candidacy. Many expressed concerns about his campaign, especially since a losing Biden campaign could also sharply diminish Democrats' chances of maintaining their slim Senate majority or retaking control of the House from Republicans.\n\nSome of the Democratic lawmakers adopted a wait-and-see stance on Biden continuing in the presidential race as he hosts the NATO summit this week in Washington and on Thursday holds a rare solo news conference, a sure-to-be watched event to see whether Biden can authoritatively answer reporters' questions.\n\n\"Right now, President Biden is the nominee, and we support the Democratic nominee that will beat Donald Trump,\" a House Democratic leader, Representative Pete Aguilar of California, said Tuesday. \"Let's see. Let's see the press conference. Let's see the campaign stops. Let's see all of this, because all of it is going to be necessary.\"\n\nSenator Michael Bennet of Colorado told his Democratic colleagues he did not think Biden would win the election, later telling CNN he thinks Trump is on track to \"maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\" But he declined to say Biden should step aside.\n\nRepresentative Julia Brownley of California said Biden \"has to make a decision. You could say he's already made a decision. Is that a final decision? If it is, then I don't think there's another alternative.\"\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos, the ABC News anchor who interviewed Biden last Friday about his fitness for the presidential race, was caught on camera Tuesday indicating that he doesn't think Biden can serve another four years.\n\nStephanopoulos, walking in gym clothes on a New York street in a video published by TMZ, was asked by a passerby: \"What do you think, do you think Biden should step down? You've talked to him more than anybody else has lately. And you can be honest.\"\n\nStephanopoulos, then just off camera, is captured on fuzzy audio responding that he doesn't think \"he can serve four more years.\"\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, Stephanopoulos acknowledged that he was the person seen in the video, saying, \"Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn't have.\"\n\nAn ABC spokeswoman said that Stephanopoulos \"expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\"", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mikie Sherrill said in a statement that \"I know that President Biden and his team have been true public servants and have put the country and the best interests of democracy first and foremost in their considerations.\"\n\n\"And because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won't run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee,\" she added.\n\nWhile no Senate Democrats have publically stated that Biden shouldn't run, there have been reports of growing unease with his candidacy within the caucus.\n\nBiden is attempting to use the ongoing NATO summit in Washington to prove his doubters wrong. In a forceful speech on Tuesday, Biden pledged to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nVladimir \"Putin wants nothing less, nothing less, than Ukraine's total subjugation ... and to wipe Ukraine off the map,\" Biden said as he read off a teleprompter. \"Ukraine can and will stop Putin.\"\n\nHe added: \"Today NATO is stronger than it's ever been in its history.\"\n\nSome diplomats at the summit said the damage from the debate remains difficult to repair.\n\n\"We don't see how he can come back after the debate,\" a European diplomat told Reuters. \"I can't imagine him being at [the] helm of the US and NATO for four more years.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/10/14/pelosibiden.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 836, "textEnd": 843}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

But if that's why you're here, it isn't true.\"\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi, arriving at her office, tells CBS News' Jaala Brown her comments to Morning Joe are being misrepresented,\" CBS' Ellis Kim shared over this quote:\n\nThe New York Times ran this headline announcing that Pelosi had suggested Biden should \"reconsider\" decision to stay in the race, and that she is the \"most senior member of his party so far to suggest his status at the top of the ticket is uncertain\":\n\nThe California Democrat also gave that statement to the New York Times, which is now in their article.\n\nSo, let's check this out. On MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Morning Joe, Pelosi was asked specifically about what she would say to Congressional Democrats about their concerns about Biden. (I'm sharing a lot of context here, because it matters.)\n\nMIKA: The headlines, the polling, it all feels very dark. How do you think the President is doing in light of his poor debate performance? Can he do more? And what do you say to Democrats in Congress and even members of the Senate, who are beginning to waver in their support?\n\nPELOSI: Good morning. That's one version of the story. What I do want to say is that yesterday I was honored to be present at the President's speech for NATO. He was absolutely spectacular. He was received over and over again with ovations for what he had to say and the force with which he said it.... So it was a beautifully received, energetic presentation by the President.\n\nPolitics is politics. People have their interest in terms of their own region and the rest, and so we are the Democratic Party, a party that is, shall we say, not lock step. But this president has been a great president, and I can tell you firsthand as a person who orchestrated many of the pieces of legislation that the President takes great pride in, and he should, because he was there at the table, chapter and verse, very conversant with a vision, a purpose, with the knowledge of the issues, with values underlining it all, and again, always asking the question, what does this mean to working families in our country?\n\nSo any thought that he wasn't able to deliver on all of those is, I can just say just didn't happen.\n\nThen she was asked, \"Does he have your support to be the head of Democrats?\"\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to to make that decision, because time is running short. The, I think, overwhelming support of the of the caucus -- It's not for me to say I'm not the head of the caucus anymore -- but he's beloved. He is respected, and people want him to make that decision.\"\n\nShe's asked, \"He has made. He has said he has made the decision. He has said firmly, this week, he is going to run. Do you want him to run?\"\n\nPELOSI: I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's that's the way it is, whatever he decides we go with. I think it's really important. And I would hope everyone would join in to let him deal with this NATO conference. This is a very big deal. 30 heads of over 30 heads of state are here. He is the host of it. And that means not just hosting it. Means orchestrating the discussion and setting the agenda. And he's doing so magnificently. And I said, 'Everyone, let's, let's just hold off whatever you're thinking either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.' But I'm very proud of the President.\n\nCould she have given a better, more forceful endorsement? Yes. The President already said he is staying in the race, so it's unclear why she is suggesting he hasn't made the decision yet.\n\nI were to call this one as someone who has interviewed the former Speaker several times, I'd take into account Pelosi's careful way with words to suggest there is something going on behind the scenes, maybe a Congressional contingency who need to be appeased by feeling they have a say in things. She mentions people having their \"regions\" to take into account, for example, and that they are not in lockstep.\n\nPelosi is urging people to stop speaking out publicly and to wait until after NATO to see if they still have these concerns. The diplomat who managed throughout her historically successful Speakership to bring all of the different concerns of a diverse caucus together over and over again won't override these people's concerns in public, but she is forcefully reminding people of Biden's strength at NATO and his legislative successes, which she was a huge part of making happen.\n\nOne thing that is nowhere in her comments is urging Biden to \"reconsider\" decision to stay in the race. That's simply not in her comments. Not anywhere. And listening to the entire piece, that's not what I take away from it.\n\nThe Times article itself makes an effort to be more fair, even while making the case that they suspect Pelosi doesn't support Biden anymore, but it's the headline that does the most negative spin work for the paper -- and journalists often don't control their headlines.\n\nIs it fair that Pelosi called out the New York Times for making up news? Democrats are side-eyeing their previous attachment to the Grey Lady after the way the paper spun a literal conspiracy out of a doctor's visits to the White House, without even checking the schedule to determine if President Biden was there, coupled with their front page being littered with concern trolling about Biden while lacking any kind of equitable coverage of his opponent Donald Trump or his agenda to destroy U.S. democracy as we know it. Instead of retracting their conspiracy when it was set straight by facts, they ran it in the print edition.\n\nDo Americans want Wordle more than they want democracy? Perhaps, as the New York Times made more than a billion dollars in digital subscriptions last year.\n\nThe bottom line here is yes, the title is inaccurate.

I think that this kind of internal debate will end at some point. The question is when,\" Blumenthal told reporters Thursday.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wa., also released a statement, saying Biden needs to \"seriously consider\" his political future despite the president's public declarations that he will continue seeking re-election.\n\n\"At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future,\" Murray wrote in a statement Monday.\n\nMurray added that Biden still needs to prove himself as a more \"energetic\" candidate.\n\n\"I have a deep appreciation and strong respect for Joe, who has led a historic first term as President,\" Murray wrote. \"Still, we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job.\"\n\nSen.

Read all about Cardinals' comeback from 5-run deficit to outlast Nats in 11th\n\nIt's a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable -- having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection.\n\nBiden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week with a crowded schedule of formal meetings, sideline chats and long diplomatic dinners. He faces his next public test Thursday when he is scheduled to hold a news conference that many are watching for signs of his abilities.\n\nTo be sure, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill, whose leadership was instrumental in ushering the president to victory in 2020 and is standing by him as the country's best choice to defeat Trump again in 2024.\n\n\"At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,\" Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are \"losing ground\" the longer they fight over Biden's candidacy. \"Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.\"\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's wounded candidacy, her comments viewed as important for the party's direction as members weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Trump.\n\nBecause of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president's thinking.\n\nThe lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden's continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most clearly. Her remarks came moments before actor Clooney, who had just hosted a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser for the president last month, said in a New York Times op-ed that the Biden he saw three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2020. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully late Tuesday about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it's for the president \"to consider\" the options.\n\nStopping just short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private - that he believes Trump \"is on track to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBennet said, \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said Wednesday he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden winning the election, which he called existential for the country.\n\n\"We have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,\" Blumenthal said on CNN.\n\nDemocrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign's lackluster response to their pleas that Biden, at 81, show voters he is up for another four-year term.\n\nBiden and his campaign are working more intently now to shore up support, and the president met with labor leaders Wednesday, relying on the unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age.\n\nWith the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions, Biden told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nWhile more House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nPelosi of California said Biden \"has been a great president\" who is beloved and respected by House Democrats.\n\nThe Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments.\n\nWhile foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats \"let's just hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see,\" she said, how it goes \"this week.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n0 Comments", "source":

And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nThe remarks, by one of the most senior Democrats in Congress, were seized upon as an attempt to reopen the debate over whether President Biden should remain on the ticket.\n\nThe 81-year-old president appeared to have temporarily silenced doubters within his own party this week with a forceful letter to his colleagues and an interview with ABC when he said only 'the Almighty' could get him to stand down.\n\nOn Wednesday, some Democrats who had privately called on him to quit the race reversed themselves in public, as the Congressional Black Caucus and Left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighed in behind the president.\n\nMany House Democrats appeared resigned to him remaining on the ticket after a meeting in which they privately discussed concerns over his candidacy.\n\nThe former speaker's intervention is likely to reinvigorate efforts to persuade Mr Biden to stand aside for a younger replacement, after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in which he repeatedly lost his train of thought.\n\nMrs Pelosi, 84, said that the president and his party should focus on the Nato conference this week before coming to a decision on Mr Biden's future.\n\nThe president is due to hold a press conference on Thursday evening in which his responses will be closely monitored for the slurring and moments of confusion that punctuated the debate.\n\n\"Let's just hold off,\" Mrs Pelosi urged on MSNBC, adding: \"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nNate Silver, the prominent analyst and pollster, said that Mrs Pelosi's remarks on \"Biden's favourite show\" were \"as close as possible to saying he should drop out without saying it outright\", noting that the odds promptly jumped on Mr Biden quitting the race.\n\nMrs Pelosi is often cited as one of few key Democrats who could influence Mr Biden's decision-making, alongside the Obamas and his close family.\n\nIt came after Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) warned Republicans could take the White House, the House and the Senate in a \"landslide\" win if Mr Biden stayed in the race.\n\n\"It's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again,\" he told CNN.\n\nOn Thursday, Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) said that Democrats needed to consider the \"down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate\".\n\n\"Blindness is not bliss,\" he said, \"amid the terrifying threat of a Trump presidency.\"\n\nMr Biden's presence on the ballot could turn New York into a \"battleground\" state, data shows.\n\nThe president's lead in the state, which he carried by 23 points in 2020, has narrowed to just 8.9 per cent, according to polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight.\n\nMark Levine, the Democratic leader of Manhattan borough, told Politico that while New York had been deep blue for decades, the data made him \"truly believe we're a battleground state now\".\n\nNationally, Mr Biden's support has dropped from around 47 per cent on June 27, the day of the presidential debate, to 44 per cent, in what the Cook Political Report termed the most dramatic \"polling shift of the year\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

The 81-year-old Biden is also taking part in the NATO summit and looking to use the organization's 75th anniversary meeting as a way to spotlight support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia and to reset his stumbling campaign.\n\nBiden has been under intense scrutiny since his disastrous debate performance, putting pressure on a White House that until recently had been marked by discipline and loyalty.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has been reveling in the turmoil surrounding the Biden campaign and pressure from Biden's party to step down. Trump is also expected to soon announce his Republican running mate.\n\nBiden didn't face calls to step aside or concerns about his fitness for office on a call he hosted for nearly 200 Democratic mayors. That's according to those who were on the call.\n\nReactions from some mayors:\n\n\u00b7 Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a letter that Biden was \"pretty fired up,\" and that he and Kamala Harris are \"exactly the leaders we need at this moment.\"\n\n\u00b7 Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson told AP \"the president is in it to win it.\"\n\n\u00b7 Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas said in an online post he will \"proudly stand with Joe!\"\n\nAn eighth Democratic member of Congress has publicly called on President Joe Biden to step aside, the New York Times reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pat Ryan of New York said he no longer believed Biden could make the case necessary to defeat Trump.\n\nHe called Trump an \"existential threat\" to American democracy and said that he was asking Biden to drop out \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nIt comes as Democrats continue to wrestle with the extraordinary question of whether to stand behind the president or push him to bow out.\n\nMovie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Biden to leave the presidential race.\n\nClooney said in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race and any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" wrote Clooney, who has hosted high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month.\n\nThe president of Finland says that regardless of whether Biden or Trump win the presidency in November, the U.S. will remain a superpower. That will require it to have strong allies -- especially in Europe.\n\nAlexander Stubb said he is worried about the \"polarization of the political climate,\" calling it \"quite toxic.\"\n\nStubb spoke to reporters as he arrived at the NATO summit Wednesday.\n\nStubb also said there is \"strong bipartisan support\" for Ukraine and NATO, following a meeting with 15 U.S. senators.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Ukraine is on an \"irreversible\" path to NATO membership.\n\nThat advances American assurances that Ukraine will be allowed to join the Western self-defense alliance after its war against Russia ends.\n\nAll 32 allies are expected to issue a joint communique Wednesday cementing that \"irreversible\" commitment to Ukraine. That's according to a European official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss before the release.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has battled for a firm guarantee Ukraine can join. The U.S. and some others have opposed to avoid an escalation with Russia that could lead to a larger war.\n\n-- Associated Press reporter Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this story.\n\n__\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a one-sentence statement after the president held a virtual event with nearly 200 Democratic mayors.\n\n\"I'm supporting our nominee, President Biden,\" she said.\n\nBass is a former member of Congress who was on Biden's vice-presidential shortlist during his 2020 campaign.\n\nU.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California has also backed the president, sending a fundraising appeal on behalf of Biden's campaign.\n\n\"The stakes of this election are simply too high to continue fretting and worrying,\" he wrote.\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi stopped short of saying President Joe Biden should continue his re-election campaign, saying \"it's up to the president to decide\" if he's going to run.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" Pelosi said early Wednesday on MSNBC.\n\nPressed on whether she personally wants Biden to stay on the top of the ticket, Pelosi said, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do.\"\n\nShe said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at NATO, and while foreign leaders are in Washington she encouraged Democrats to \"hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's candidacy.", "source":

That's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nHer remarks suggested that Democrats on Capitol Hill are still seeking more assurances from the Biden campaign on the viability of his candidacy. On Tuesday, the Cook Political Report, one of the most respected election prognosticators, moved six states in Donald Trump's direction as the former president opened up a wider lead in the aftermath of the debate.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Biden gave a robust speech to open the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. this week. He also faces intense scrutiny on Thursday, when he holds a press conference, with reporters likely to pepper him with questions about his ability to serve another four years.

In any event, the issue here is political assassination, not bodily, and George Clooney pulled the trigger in his guest essay to the New York Times Wednesday morning.\n\nSo where do we go from here? Here's the simple lay of the land. Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer cannot take a stand. They are like pieces on a chessboard. They are frozen in place. But, the queen piece is still on the chess board, too. Congresswoman Pelosi can and will, I predict, take the helm and guide the party through these rough waters. Clooney said, \"the dam has broken.\" Yes, it has, and you're the one that broke it, George. I hope that you can live with the consequences of your actions because if this election goes south, your name is going to be Major Mudd. Politico:\n\nAs House Democrats concerned about JOE BIDEN's vitality as a candidate bit their tongues this week, one senior House Democratic aide offered this thought to Playbook: \"NANCY PELOSI has more balls than most of the men in this caucus.\"\n\nThe former speaker has long been a close ally of the president's. She privately pulled for Biden during the 2020 primary as progressive White House hopefuls dismissed him as old news in a party tilting increasingly left. She worked closely with Biden to pass much of his agenda, shepherding through climate and infrastructure spending, gun control measures and other big-ticket items that have now become the cornerstone of his legacy.\n\nAnd now that Biden's campaign is flailing, many Democrats have been looking to Pelosi as the best-positioned leader to potentially convince the president to step aside.\n\nThis morning, Pelosi buoyed those hopes when she went on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and subtly suggested Biden needs to reconsider his decision to stay in the race.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said, implicitly rejecting Biden's stated decision that he is continuing to run. \"The time is running short. ... He's beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision.\"\n\nPelosi had previously noted her \"full confidence\" in Biden last week as rumblings emerged from members on whether he was fit for office, support she has parrotted this week when prodded. But in recent days she's been avoiding the press and refusing to engage on the crisis engulfing her party.\n\nNow Pelosi did do a bit of clean-up on what she said this morning. Speaking to CBS after the interview, she accused some reporters of taking her words out of context: \"I never said he should reconsider his decision,\" she said. \"The decision is the president's.\"\n\nAnd yet (1) that doesn't contradict what she said earlier, and (2) those who have covered Pelosi for years, as we have, know that the speaker rarely utters a word without a plan and an intention. There's little doubt that she knew -- and fleshed out with confidants -- exactly what she was doing before she was mic'd up at MSNBC this morning.\n\nIn many ways, Pelosi is the most sensible choice to lead a rebellion against Biden. The currently elected congressional leader, HAKEEM JEFFRIES and CHUCK SCHUMER, are caught in the middle of a divided caucus. Taking sides on the matter could undercut their standing as leaders, create future enemies and otherwise undercut their own influence.\n\nPelosi has already cemented her legacy. Unshackled from the burdens of caucus leadership, she doesn't need to worry about pleasing members -- something, we should be honest, she rarely fretted about as speaker. As such, she could be the one Democrat with the gravitas and wherewithal to tell Biden what everyone is saying privately -- if, of course, she is willing.\n\nMeanwhile ... Reactions to Pelosi's comments have varied on Capitol Hill. While some senior Democrats, including Jeffries and Caucus Chair PETE AGUILAR side-stepped questions, saying they hadn't yet seen her appearance on MSNBC. Yet there were signs that her comments were providing cover for other Democrats to speak more frankly.\n\nWhat they are saying:\n\nWe absolutely cannot go forward as a house divided. This is the point of no return. We need to get on the same page, as Democrats, and decide what is to be done. If Kamala is going to take the reins and that is the only sane way to go, not some ad hoc relitigating of the primacy process next month at the Democratic convention, then that decision needs to be made soon. As New York Rep. Richie Torres said, \"In determining how to proceed as a party, there must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate. What matters is not how we feel but what the numbers tell us.\" Torres said today in a statement. He added in comments to CNN: \"If we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\"\n\nThat's about the size of it. I don't think George Clooney understands the magnitude of what he is asking for. We are less than four months out from the 2024 election. We can't be sabotaging our incumbent president. If the decision is made jointly between President Biden and trusted colleagues of many years, like Nancy Pelosi, then it needs to be done now.\n\nAnd then we don't know what's going to happen. This has never been tried before. Franklin Delano Rooseveldt was not in good physical health when he ran for a fourth term. But he was in great political health. Everybody was behind him. There was little question but that he would win again, and he did. Biden may be in the top 10 percentile of octagenarians physically, and probably he is, and probably mentally as well, but the perception that he's lost it and the betrayal of those close to him at this late hour is killing his candidacy. And it is paving the way for the return of Trump.\n\nIt's all in Nancy Pelosi's hands now, I feel. And I must say that's the only comforting aspect of this entire debacle. I trust her political instincts more than anybody else out there in politics. If anybody can guide us through this unspeakable mess, she is the one.\n\nMaybe it's time to sail out on uncharted waters and see how an underdog vice president, with dismal approval ratings, can do against the worst human being ever to run for office, let alone three times, Donald Trump. I fear for our nation. I fear for democracy in the world.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw", "type":

Here's what we know.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Just when it looked like President Joe Biden was starting to unite congressional Democrats around his embattled reelection bid, the dam has cracked.\n\nA drip-drip of calls from party faithful for a dramatic last-minute change atop the Democratic ticket this November is turning into something else entirely.\n\nWhat had started as pleadings from a few lone lawmakers, donors and media figures in its earliest days after the incumbent 81-year-old president's poor performance at his June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump now includes warnings from the country's first-ever female House speaker, plus senior Senate Democrats and the nation's most well-known celebrities.\n\nFirst came Sen. Michael Bennett, D-Colo., who gave a blistering assessment of Biden's reelection bid in an interview Tuesday night on CNN, warning that former President Donald Trump could defeat the incumbent Democrat \"by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBy Wednesday morning, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., seemed to question whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" a television program Biden himself called into two days earlier defending his 2024 candidacy and is widely known to regularly watch.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said, even though Biden has made clear repeatedly since last month's debate that he's still running for reelection. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., previously supportive of Biden, told reporters he too is \"deeply concerned about Joe Biden winning this election.\" U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y, said in a statement \"there must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot of whomever we nominate.\"\n\n\"What matters is not how we feel but what the numbers tell us,\" Torres said Wednesday.\n\nThe shift comes after most Democrats in Congress, which reconvened this week, have so far held off on publicly calling for Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election following his disastrous debate performance last month - even as many express grave concerns about Biden's chances to beat Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nAiming to shore up support, Biden's campaign is making another effort Thursday by sending three senior campaign advisors to meet with Senate Democrats. The full caucus normally only meets once a week.\n\nWhat's at stake? Although eight House Democrats have said publicly Biden should end his campaign, no Democratic senators have gone as far, and the president has held onto support from the entire Black and Hispanic caucuses, two key voices in the Democratic coalition.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden campaign surrogate, told reporters Wednesday he has \"no feelings\" about Pelosi's comments.\n\nBut Biden's mounting resistance extends beyond the Capitol.\n\nActor George Clooney - a major Democratic donor who just last month co-hosted a lucrative Hollywood fundraiser for Biden - called for a new Democratic nominee in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nWith the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago - and Republicans holding their convention next week - Democrats face a time crunch if they want to find a different nominee. Some appear to be sensing an urgency.\n\n\"Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump,\" Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., who represents a swing congressional district, said in a statement Wednesday. \"For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside - to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden",

But they will be gone late Thursday. Then it will likely fall to Pelosi and Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), another veteran House leader, to meet privately with the president, who is a dear friend and former colleague to both of them.\n\n\"I've said to everyone: Let's just hold off,\" Pelosi said on MSNBC. \"Whatever you're thinking: Either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\n\"Privately\" is how Pelosi tends to handle important matters, especially when the future of her party and the country is at stake. Except, however, on \"Morning Joe\" Wednesday, when she became the most senior Democrat to suggest Biden should reconsider his candidacy when she publicly declined to say whether she still supports the 81-year-old Biden for president.\n\nPelosi, 85, said \"it's up to the president\" to decide but that \"we're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\n\nLess than two hours after she spoke, George Clooney, the actor and major Democratic fundraiser, used a New York Times op-ed to bluntly tell Biden to quit and to do it to \"save democracy.\" That intervention from a reliable Democratic star and longtime Biden ally will only increase the sense of time running out for Biden.\n\nWaiting until after the NATO meeting concludes means waiting until the next opportunity for Biden to stumble on Thursday afternoon, when he's scheduled to hold a live press conference to wrap up the summit.\n\nPelosi's former longtime chief of staff, John Lawrence, recently mused in his blog, Domeocracy, that First Lady Jill Biden and the president's sister, Valerie, may conclude that the president's legacy will be \"irreparably shredded if his physical and mental capability become the singular issue of the campaign\" rather than focusing on defeating Donald Trump.\n\nLawrence also floated that it will take the likes of his former powerful boss and Clyburn, a proven rainmaker who turns 84 this month, to meet privately with Biden and make the case that enough is enough -- it's time to save your legacy, save your party and save the country.\n\nLawrence noted that Clyburn often chastised rank-and-file Democrats with his signature phrase, \"If you're 'splainin, you're losin'.\"\n\n\"Clyburn surely knows there is no way Biden can 'splain his way out\" of his disastrous debate performance, which shined a spotlight on the president's mental acuity and raised serious questions about his fitness to serve as commander in chief.\n\nSo far, only a handful of congressional Democrats have openly called for Biden to step aside -- even as they privately worry and grouse.\n\nIf Democratic congressional leaders, who now worry that Biden could take them down with him, by losing both the House and the Senate to Republicans, do convince the president to abandon his run for relection, Clyburn would play the pivotal role at a brokered Democratic National Convention in Chicago. As Lawrence noted, Clyburn's longtime former aide Jamie Harrison, is the DNC chairman.\n\n\"No one wants to pile on good old Joe at what must be the lowest moment of his career, but there are bigger stakes than preserving Biden's ego (or his family's exhortations to stick it out),\" Lawrence wote on his blog. But if anyone can play the role of \"political seismologist\" and convince Biden to end his race, \"I would be on Jim Clyburn.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

She is not calling on Biden to reconsider his run for president, she insisted, reiterating her view that he has been a \"great\" president, according to CBS News.\n\nBut the fact that she urged Biden to make a decision -- he has unequivocally said he is staying in the race -- has fueled the impression that his candidacy is still very much an open question.\n\nBiden has attempted to project a sense of inevitability that he will be the Democratic nominee when the party gathers for its convention in August and, to the chagrin of some members of his party, is the only one who can release the delegates bound to vote for him.\n\nYet Pelosi's repeated nudges at Biden could help colleagues feel more comfortable expressing doubts of their own.\n\nShortly after her interview, Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY), a vulnerable incumbent, became the eighth House Democrat to call on Biden to step aside, while Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) urged fellow Democrats to make a sober calculation about the ripple effect in House and Senate races if Biden stays the presidential nominee.\n\n\"In determining how to proceed as a party, there must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\" Torres said in a statement. \"What matters is not how we feel but what the numbers tell us.\"\n\nPolling shows Biden slipping further behind Trump in battleground states, while Democrats fear even safe districts are being jeopardized with his candidacy.\n\nPelosi's approach stands in contrast to that of other senior members of the party. Her successor, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), has only said his support for Biden has not changed, comments echoed by his deputies.\n\n\"Right now, President Biden is the nominee, and we support the Democratic nominee,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA), the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told reporters on Monday.\n\nHer remarks also demonstrate a continued desire to steer the caucus she led for two decades. The 84-year-old Pelosi stepped down from leadership last year, clearing the way for Jeffries's ascension, but remains a mentor to him and a prominent voice in the halls of Congress.\n\nHer remarks on Morning Joe were likely tailored as much for public consumption as they were for the president. Biden is a regular viewer of the show.

Fox & Friends Face-Off On Pelosi's Guarded Remarks On Whether Biden Should Drop Out", "body": "Fox & Friends hosts argued out the real meaning of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) guarded non-answer on Morning Joe over whether President Joe Biden should stay in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe veteran Democratic lawmaker was asked by MSNBC host Jon Lemire whether she supported Biden's continued run for president amid ongoing criticism and pressure to drop out, to which Pelosi said: \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nWhen pressed Pelosi ignored Lemire's reminder that Biden has already explicitly declared his commitment to running and replied: \"Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nIn the moments following the interview, Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy introduced the clip from Morning Joe, suggesting that Pelosi's \"answer should not make [Biden] feel good.\"\n\nAfter running the video, Doocy discussed the reply with co-hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Brian Kilmeade, and Lawrence Jones to figure out what exactly Pelosi was trying to say.\n\nDOOCY That's very telling at the end: 'Let's see how it goes this week.'\n\nEARHARDT: Well, Nancy, he did decide, he said 'I'm not going anywhere' and she said she supports him and will stick by his side no matter what.\n\nKILMEADE: What does that mean?\n\nJONES: I tell you at I think it means, no one more precise with words than Nancy Pelosi. She knows exactly what she's saying.\n\nKILMEADE: Even when she slurs them.\n\nJONES: The translation is: 'We have encouraged him behind the scenes to step aside but whatever he wants to do, if he's staying in it, we're with him.' And that is what's been happening behind the scenes. This is cover for the Democrats that have been causing a stir.\n\nEARHARDT: Not answering the question.\n\nJONES: It's really not but it is cover for the Democrats who have been openly saying, 'we want him to go.'\n\nAfter a brief digression to discuss the performance of former President Donald Trump in the polls, the team returned to Pelosi's remarks to place wagers.\n\nKILMEADE: But it's amazing. Bottom line is Nancy Pelosi says Joe should make a decision. Hey Nancy, he's made his decision. He's made it. You say words are measured, that is the weirdest thing ever. First thing I will ask [former President Donald Trump] on the radio today.\n\nEARHARDT: She covers herself because she says whatever he decides. 'If he decides do this, check that box, I support him. If he decides to get out, check that box, I support him.'\n\nDOOCY: It's part of the Pelosi Push - she wants him out.\n\nJONES: She wants him to go but she can't say that.\n\nEARHARDT: Or maybe she knows he is going to get out.\n\nJONES: No, I think we're closer to Steve paying me $1.

And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nThe remarks, by one of the most senior Democrats in Congress, were seized upon as an attempt to reopen the debate over whether President Biden should remain on the ticket.\n\nThe 81-year-old President appeared to have temporarily silenced doubters within his party this week with a forceful letter to his colleagues and an interview with ABC when he said only \"the Almighty\" could get him to stand down.\n\nOn Wednesday, some Democrats who had privately called on him to quit the race reversed themselves in public, as the Congressional Black Caucus and Left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighed in behind the President.\n\nMany House Democrats appeared resigned to him remaining on the ticket after a meeting in which they privately discussed concerns over his candidacy.\n\nThe former Speaker's intervention is likely to reinvigorate efforts to persuade Biden to stand aside for a younger replacement, after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in which he repeatedly lost his train of thought.\n\nPelosi, 84, said that the President and his party should focus on the Nato conference this week before coming to a decision on Biden's future.\n\nThe President is due to hold a press conference on Thursday evening in which his responses will be closely monitored for the slurring and moments of confusion that punctuated the debate.\n\n\"Let's just hold off,\" Pelosi urged on MSNBC, adding: \"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nNate Silver, the prominent analyst and pollster, said that Pelosi's remarks on \"Biden's favourite show\" were \"as close as possible to saying he should drop out without saying it outright\", noting that the odds promptly jumped on Biden quitting the race.\n\nPelosi is often cited as one of the few key Democrats who could influence Biden's decision-making, alongside the Obamas and his close family.\n\nLloyd Doggett, the first Democrat to call on Biden to stand down, said that the former Speaker's comments were \"keeping the situation very open, very fluid\".\n\n\"I don't think it moves members, but I think it compromises the goal to solidify support for Biden/move forward,\" a senior Democratic aide told the news website Semafor.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the debate, Pelosi said it was a \"legitimate question\" to ask if Biden had a \"condition\" that caused his stuttering performance.\n\nIt came after Democratic Senator Michael Bennet warned Republicans could take the White House, the House and the Senate in a \"landslide\" win if Biden stayed in the race.\n\n\"It's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again,\" he told CNN.\n\nOn Thursday, Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York said that Democrats needed to consider the \"down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate\".\n\n\"Blindness is not bliss,\" he said, \"amid the terrifying threat of a Trump presidency.\"\n\nBiden's presence on the ballot could turn New York into a \"battleground\" state, data shows.\n\nThe President's lead in the state, which he carried by 23 points in 2020, has narrowed to just 8.9%, according to polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight.\n\nMark Levine, the Democrat leader of the Manhattan borough, told Politico that while New York had been deep blue for decades, the data made him \"truly believe we're a battleground state now\".\n\nNationally, Biden's support has dropped from around 47% on June 27, the day of the presidential debate, to 44%, in what the Cook Political Report termed the most dramatic \"polling shift of the year\".", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Pat Ryan became the eighth House Democrat to call on President Biden to step aside from the 2024 running on Wednesday. 'Trump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him. Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump,' Ryan, a moderate from a swing district, wrote on X.\n\n'For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside -- to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.' Ryan was first elected in 2022 and Republicans have made his district a top target for 2024.\n\nAs the White House tries to tamp down dissent, Biden's chances of being the Democratic nominee in November are waffling. Democrats who haven't called on him to step down have insisted the door is still open for him to do so - even though Biden adamantly insists he'll remain in the race.\n\n'It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running out,' former Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday morning. Reminded that Biden has made up his mind, Pelosi said: 'I want him to do whatever he decides to do.'\n\n'Whatever he decides, we go with.' Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said Biden's insistence that he'll remain in the race doesn't mean that decision is final. 'It doesn't work that way.'\n\n'I had totally decided to take an Uber to dinner. And then I heard about the gridlock in DC because of the NATO traffic. And I redirected to the Metro and it was a really smart decision,' he told reporters. Biden wrote in a letter to House Democrats on Monday: 'I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump .'\n\nAlso on Wednesday actor George Clooney, a longtime ally of top Democrats, called on Biden to step aside. 'The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,' Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n'In determining how to proceed as a party, there must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,' New York Democrat Ritchie Torres said in a cryptic statement. 'If we're going to choose a particular path, we should be clear-eyed about its consequences. Blindness is not bliss amid the terrifying threat of a Trump presidency.'\n\n'An unsentimental analysis of the cold hard numbers -- which have no personal feelings or political loyalties -- should inform what we decide.' Asked if that meant he didn't think Biden was best fit to lead the party, Torres told DailyMail.com: 'The statement speaks for itself. What are the numbers telling us about the presidents viability?'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Wire, USA TODAY\n\nJuly 10, 2024 at 7:13 PM\n\nWASHINGTON -- Just when it looked like President Joe Biden was starting to unite congressional Democrats around his embattled reelection bid, the dam has cracked.\n\nA drip-drip of calls from party faithful for a dramatic last-minute change atop the Democratic ticket this November is turning into something else entirely.\n\nWhat had started as pleadings from a few lone lawmakers, donors and media figures in its earliest days after the incumbent 81-year-old president's poor performance at his June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump now includes warnings from the country's first-ever female House speaker, plus senior Senate Democrats and the nation's most well-known celebrities.\n\nFirst came Sen. Michael Bennett, D-Colo., who gave a blistering assessment of Biden's reelection bid in an interview Tuesday night on CNN, warning that former President Donald Trump could defeat the incumbent Democrat \"by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House.\"\n\nBy Wednesday morning, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., seemed to question whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" a television program Biden himself called into two days earlier defending his 2024 candidacy and is widely known to regularly watch.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said, even though Biden has made clear repeatedly since last month's debate that he's still running for reelection. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., previously supportive of Biden, told reporters he too is \"deeply concerned about Joe Biden winning this election.\" U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y, said in a statement \"there must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot of whomever we nominate.\"\n\n\"What matters is not how we feel but what the numbers tell us,\" Torres said Wednesday.\n\nThe shift comes after most Democrats in Congress, which reconvened this week, have so far held off on publicly calling for Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election following his disastrous debate performance last month - even as many express grave concerns about Biden's chances to beat Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nAiming to shore up support, Biden's campaign is making another effort Thursday by sending three senior campaign advisors to meet with Senate Democrats. The full caucus normally only meets once a week.\n\nWhat's at stake? Although eight House Democrats have said publicly Biden should end his campaign, no Democratic senators have gone as far, and the president has held onto support from the entire Black and Hispanic caucuses, two key voices in the Democratic coalition.\n\nRep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden campaign surrogate, told reporters Wednesday he has \"no feelings\" about Pelosi's comments.\n\nBut Biden's mounting resistance extends beyond the Capitol.\n\nActor George Clooney - a major Democratic donor who just last month co-hosted a lucrative Hollywood fundraiser for Biden - called for a new Democratic nominee in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nWith the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago - and Republicans holding their convention next week - Democrats face a time crunch if they want to find a different nominee. Some appear to be sensing an urgency.\n\n\"Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump,\" Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., who represents a swing congressional district, said in a statement Wednesday. \"For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside - to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden's dam begins to crack with new Democratic

We're all encouraging him to to make that decision. Because time is running short,\" Pelosi said in a TV interview on Tuesday, even though Biden has insisted he will now bow out.\n\nPressed on whether she wanted him to seek re-election, Pelosi, in what fell well short of a full-throated endorsement, told MSNBC's Morning Joe, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"\n\nElsewhere, Democratic Senator Michael Bennett expressed fears that Trump could win a landslide in November as things stand. Even George Stephanopoulus, the ABC News anchor and former Democratic operative whose platform Biden went on to assert he will stay in the race, was caught on candid camera on a New York street, saying \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\"\n\nAmid continued turmoil in the party, Biden displayed energy and vigor in an address to NATO leaders in which he pledged more military support for Ukraine and a further strengthening of the western alliance.\n\n\"When this senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country. Today, it is still a free country, and the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country. Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail,\" Biden said in a forceful speech that drew repeated applause from the assembled NATO leaders.\n\nMany of them fear that a Biden defeat and a return of Trump to the White House will torpedo NATO because the former President does not think highly of the alliance and is pally with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a course that will throw Ukraine and other frontline European nations under the Moscow bus.\n\nWhile Biden's speech -- read from a teleprompter -- was assertive and largely error-free, the jury is still out on whether he has the energy to lead America for another four years. He will be put to another public test at an unscripted, open-ended White House press conference on Thursday evening.\n\nPelosi herself said she wanted to delay the conversations about Biden's future till after the NATO summit. \"Let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" she said in what appeared to be advice to Democrats.\n\nAmid all this, vice-president Kamala Harris has continued to back Biden's renomination even as she builds her own profile, inviting a New York Times story with a headline that read, \"For Kamala Harris, the Challenge of Getting Ready Without Getting Ready.\"\n\nWith Biden holding centerstage in Washington DC, Harris is on the road in Texas and Nevada, garnering positive headlines, including calling on the US national basketball team training in Las Vegas and urging them to go for a fifth consecutive gold medal in men's basketball at the Paris Olympics.\n\nHer growing profile and talk of her replacing Biden as the party nominee has triggered trademark Trump attacks.\n\n\"The radical left Democrat Party is divided in chaos and having a full-scale breakdown. All because they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president: Sleepy, Crooked Joe Biden or Laughing Kamala,\" Trump told supporters at a rally on Tuesday, calling her Biden's \"insurance policy,\" because, \"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent they would have bounced him from office years ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType":

Joe Biden created this mess, and he's not leaving, so what can they do? For now, nothing which isn't a position that's sitting well with a large swath of congressional Democrats, many of which are now worried Biden will cost them down ballot. They're not wrong.\n\nAs Spencer wrote this morning, Pelosi stopped within an inch of calling on Biden to drop out. It surely wasn't a media hit Biden's staffers wanted to see, but the trickle of Democrats calling for Biden to step aside is growing, especially today. If there aren't calls for him to drop out, there are the even more damning ones questioning his ability to win in November.\n\nScott's questions about the 2024 race and whether Biden should continue his candidacy led to Pelosi getting snippy quickly. She said she would not share the details of her discussion with the president or discuss the \"fate of our nation\" in the hallway.\n\n\"Am I speaking English to you? I'm not going to be making any statements about any of that right now in the hallway,\" barked Pelosi to Scott.\n\nYet, the California Democrat also said she believed Biden could win, so a follow-up on whether he should stay is warranted. Pelosi also gets irritated when supposedly friendly outlets push back. She did it to PBS' Judy Woodruff during the COVID pandemic, with MSNBC's Katy Tur this year, and now with Ms. Scott at ABC News.\n\nFor years, she expected the press to take her word and move on; that will not happen regarding Joe Biden, his health, and the 2024 election. June 27 made that impossible, so get used to more questions, Nancy. You might want to get your husband to drive drunk again if you need something to change the subject, but even that wouldn't shake a national story like this.\n\nUntil Biden has a 'Flowers for Algernon '-like mental recovery, these questions aren't going away.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_vespa@townhall.com", "name": "Matt Vespa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Woodruff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judy Woodruff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Tur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katy Tur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/364/58ab2e22-30ab-43a7-b96c-6a32080e1f78.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1850, "textEnd": 1857}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Nancy Pelosi's refusal to take a stance on President Joe Biden's candidacy may be an effort to delay embarrassing him until the NATO summit concludes.\n\nPelosi, on Wednesday morning, avoided endorsing Biden and advised everyone to hold their tongue about what they want him to do until after the summit, which ends on Thursday. Todd, on \"Chris Jansing Reports,\" said Pelosi's remarks must be painful to Biden, adding that she may just be shielding the president from humiliation during the summit by not speaking out against him.\n\nBiden is hosting the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., as 32 allies convene to decide how to persist in safeguarding \"their one billion citizens as the world faces the most dangerous security environment since the Cold War,\" particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to its website.\n\n\"I find it fascinating that nobody has taken Joe Biden's answer earlier this week that he's staying in the race as definitive. Right? He put out a statement that it's definitive,\" Todd said. \"The campaign says, 'well, he's already answered this question.' Former Speaker Pelosi was even reminded of this in the interview this morning with Jonathan, and she just simply plowed forward, right, and said, 'well, the decision is up to him.'\"\n\nBiden called into \"Morning Joe\" on Monday and said that he is not dropping out from the race, even challenging dissatisfied Democrats to \"challenge\" him at the party's August convention.\n\n\"So I don't know how many different ways that Democratic lawmakers can hint that ... they don't like the decision he's made, they want him to make a different decision,\" Todd added. \"The question is, 'who could publicly and/or privately have a lot of influence with him?' I think the answer is the same person for both questions. And that's Nancy Pelosi, right?\"\n\n\"What she did this morning ... if you're the Bidens and you thought you were making progress here, that had to be really deflating,\" he continued. \"It was a bit of a twist of the knife. Like, 'you're not out of this yet. We're simply respecting the fact that NATO is in town and we don't want to humiliate you while NATO's in town. But watch out for Thursday night and Friday.'\"\n\nPelosi later on Wednesday snapped at a reporter who pressed her for her position on Biden's candidacy.\n\n\"Am I speaking English to you? I'm not going to be making any statements about any of that right now in the hallway,\" she said.\n\nCNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said on Wednesday that Biden's reelection chances are presently slim as he has fallen behind former President Donald Trump in states he must win following their debate.\n\n\"We've been talking a lot about the national polls, but of course the race is won or lost in the Electoral College. And I just really want to give an indication here that Donald Trump is favored at this particular point,\" Enten told host Jim Acosta. \"That's the bottom line.\"\n\nThe Cook Political Report on

And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides we go with,\" she said.\n\nMs. Pelosi added that the presidential hopeful is \"beloved\" and \"respected\" and that \"people want him to make that decision, not me.\"\n\nStill, she also offered the caveat that \"time is running short\" for Mr. Biden to make a decision.\n\nMs. Pelosi's failure to offer a full-on endorsement reflects a genuine hesitancy, several House Democrats suggested to Axios. \"She chooses her words very carefully,\" one unidentified Democrat told the outlet.\n\nFurther, Ms. Pelosi's deference to an impending decision by Mr. Biden suggests that the decision may still be up in the air. The implied uncertainty runs counter to Mr. Biden's staunch declaration this week that \"I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nMs. Pelosi's response to questions on MSNBC comes as seven House Democrats have publicly called for Mr. Biden to drop out of the race after his disastrous debate performance sparked concerns over his fitness to run for a second term.\n\nThe watershed debate has evidently affected the views of voters too, with a new poll placing President Trump with an eight-point lead among registered voters. Seventy-four percent responded that they viewed Mr. Biden as being too old for the job.\n\nConcerns about Mr. Biden's ability to capture enough votes to secure the presidency also were raised by Congressman Ritchie Torres soon after Ms. Pelosi's interview.\n\nMr. Torres took to X to call for a \"serious reckoning\" over the \"down-ballot effect\" of whomever the Democratic Party nominates.\n\n\"An unsentimental analysis of the cold hard numbers -- which have no personal feelings or political loyalties -- should inform what we decide and whom we nominate,\" he wrote, warning, \"If we're going to choose a particular path, we should be clear-eyed about its consequences.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "novi_zhukovsky@nysun.com", "name": "Novi Zhukovsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchie_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritchie Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hakeem-Jeffries-Biden-Pelosi.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721417", "eventUri": "eng-9721417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Todd, on \"Chris Jansing Reports,\" said Pelosi's remarks must be painful to Biden, adding that she may just be shielding the president from humiliation during the summit by not speaking out against him. (RELATED: Majority Of Voters Want To Throw Biden Overboard Following Disastrous Debate, Poll Shows)\n\nBiden is hosting the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., as 32 allies convene to decide how to persist in safeguarding \"their one billion citizens as the world faces the most dangerous security environment since the Cold War,\" particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to its website.\n\n\"I find it fascinating that nobody has taken Joe Biden's answer earlier this week that he's staying in the race as definitive. Right? He put out a statement that it's definitive,\" Todd said. \"The campaign says, 'well, he's already answered this question.' Former Speaker Pelosi was even reminded of this in the interview this morning with Jonathan, and she just simply plowed forward, right, and said, 'well, the decision is up to him.'\"\n\nBiden called into \"Morning Joe\" on Monday and said that he is not dropping out from the race, even challenging dissatisfied Democrats to \"challenge\" him at the party's August convention.\n\n\"So I don't know how many different ways that Democratic lawmakers can hint that ... they don't like the decision he's made, they want him to make a different decision,\" Todd added. \"The question is, 'who could publicly and/or privately have a lot of influence with him?' I think the answer is the same person for both questions. And that's Nancy Pelosi, right?\"\n\n\"What she did this morning ... if you're the Bidens and you thought you were making progress here, that had to be really deflating,\" he continued. \"It was a bit of a twist of the knife. Like, 'you're not out of this yet. We're simply respecting the fact that NATO is in town and we don't want to humiliate you while NATO's in town. But watch out for Thursday night and Friday.'\"\n\nPelosi later on Wednesday snapped at a reporter who pressed her for her position on Biden's candidacy.\n\n\"Am I speaking English to you? I'm not going to be making any statements about any of that right now in the hallway,\" she said.\n\nCNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said on Wednesday that Biden's reelection chances are presently slim as he has fallen behind former President Donald Trump in states he must win following their debate.\n\n\"We've been talking a lot about the national polls, but of course the race is won or lost in the Electoral College. And I just really want to give an indication here that Donald Trump is favored at this particular point,\" Enten told host Jim Acosta. \"That's the bottom line.\"\n\nThe Cook Political Report on Tuesday updated its projections to change Arizona, Georgia and Nevada from \"toss up\" states to \"lean Republican.\" It also modified New Hampshire, Minnesota and Nebraska's second district from \"likely Democrat\" to \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But some have begun to more forcefully voice their concerns after a meeting on Tuesday left the caucus in limbo about the president's standing.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about Joe Biden winning this November because it is an existential threat to the country if Donald Trump wins,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nBlumenthal's comments came after Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said Tuesday night that he thinks Trump is on track to beat Biden this November -- potentially in a \"landslide\" that could also lose Democrats the House and Senate. He urged Democrats to have a \"discussion\" about Biden's election prospects. And in the House, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined Biden's favorite morning show Wednesday and appeared to suggest that the president should consider dropping out.\n\nIn another sign of the Senate anxiety spilling into public view, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) urged Biden to \"look at all of the information and carry on detailed conversations with key leaders,\" such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, to do what's best for the country. Both Schumer and Jeffries have said they support Biden.\n\nSen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with the Democrats, told POLITICO that it's incumbent on Biden to demonstrate that he still has what it takes to campaign by answering questions in an unscripted format, adding: \"It should be soon.\"\n\nSen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who's expressed concern about Biden's bid after a disastrous debate performance, said he agreed with Pelosi's comments, while Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) bluntly said there are \"a great number of candidates who are capable of winning this November against a maniacal criminal thug like Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut party fears over the president have extended far beyond the upper chamber of Congress. An electorally vulnerable Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), called on Biden to drop out \"for the good of the country.\" Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), a veteran lawmaker who is retiring from Congress this year, became the ninth House Democrat to say Biden should step back. And actor George Clooney, a major Democratic fundraiser who appeared alongside the president just weeks ago, urged the party to select a new nominee.\n\nIt was Pelosi's comments, however, that garnered much of the attention throughout the day.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi told MSNBC. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nThe former speaker, who is respected both by Biden and the Democratic caucus, suggested that her party hold off on further discussions until Biden wraps the closely watched NATO summit, which he is hosting in Washington this week. Pelosi later said there'd been some misunderstanding about what she meant, though a spokesperson for Pelosi's office told POLITICO that she \"fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do.\"\n\nStill, other Democrats close to Biden are becoming more vocal in their concerns about his candidacy.\n\nClooney penned an op-ed in The New York Times on Wednesday calling for a new nominee to replace Biden, writing that \"we've opted to ignore every warning sign\" about his condition. He revealed that at a high-profile fundraiser he co-hosted in Los Angeles last month, Biden \"was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nBiden advisers conceded Wednesday that more work needed to be done to assure nervous Democrats, according to two officials familiar with internal campaign strategy granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nThey recognized that Pelosi's words carried weight, and that she seemed to deliberately keep alive the notion that the president could reconsider his run, which frustrated some in Wilmington. But the officials insisted that Biden's plans have not changed, and they tried to explain away Pelosi's comments as a simple recognition that some in the House were still anxious -- and that she needed to give them a voice.\n\nBiden's allies were less charitable with Clooney, who they said spent only an hour or so with Biden at the fundraiser, which was planned around the actor's schedule and therefore required the president to fly in overnight from the G7 summit in Europe, according to one of the officials.\n\nA campaign official pointed back to the letter the president sent to Hill Democrats on Monday stating that he would stay in the race. And they highlighted the president's schedule -- campaign rallies over the holiday weekend in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania followed by the NATO summit this week and another campaign trip this Friday to Michigan -- as proof that he was up to the task of a grueling presidential campaign.\n\nA growing chorus of House Democrats are speaking out in favor of Biden stepping back from the race, including Ryan, who on Wednesday became the eighth representative to do so. Ryan represents a purple district in the Hudson Valley of New York -- a blue state where support for Biden is slipping.\n\nThere were other signs of growing anxiety among Democrats who have been part of a firewall of support for the president. Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Biden's biggest base of support on the Hill, told CNN on Tuesday that vulnerable Democrats should distance themselves from the president if that's what they need to do to win reelection.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) urged the party to have a \"down-ballot reckoning of whomever we nominate\" -- declining to name Biden directly, despite denouncing the \"piling-on\" by Biden critics just two days earlier.\n\nOn Monday, Torres said \"weakening a weakened nominee seems like a losing strategy for a presidential election.\" By mid-week, the representative had urged his party to be \"clear-eyed\" about the consequences of choosing a particular nominee for president.\n\nBiden aides also recognized that the president would be under scrutiny for his performance at Thursday's news conference and at a planned Michigan rally on Friday on the heels of the grueling NATO summit schedule. But they also believed that the calendar would soon give Biden a favor.\n\nThe Republican National Convention is slated to begin Monday, and the four-day event -- which could be preceded by Trump's vice presidential choice -- will likely dominate the political conversation and could shift the spotlight off Biden.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

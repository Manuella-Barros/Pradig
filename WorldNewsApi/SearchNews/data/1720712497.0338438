Murray was joined by first-timer and 100% Redress candidate Joy Beard. There were joyous scenes in Carndonagh Community School a short time ago as both were congratulated by their family and friends. Beard\u2019s election was the second 100% Redress campaigner to be announced in a few short minutes after her fellow campaigner Ali Farren topped the poll in the Carndonagh Electoral Area. Murray polled a total first preference vote of 2,248 while Beard polled 1,587 votes. Fianna Fail\u2019s Paul Canning looks likely to take the third seat in this five seater having polled a total of 1,267 first preference votes.", "summary": "<p>Sinn Fein&#8217;s Jack Murray topped the poll and was one of two candidates elected on the first count in the&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/09/election-2024-murray-and-beard-elected-on-first-count-in-buncrana/\">Election 2024: Murray and Beard elected on first count in Buncrana</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/09/election-2024-murray-and-beard-elected-on-first-count-in-buncrana/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/24357.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:07:24", "author": "Staff Writer", "authors": ["Staff Writer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.142}

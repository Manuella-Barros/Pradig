Here's how much time he could get.", "body": "A former Columbus police office will find out Thursday how many years he will have to spend in federal prison after admitting to holding two women against their will and obstructing a federal investigation.\n\nAndrew Mitchell, 60, has been in custody since his arrest in 2019. In December, Mitchell entered guilty pleas in U.S. District Court to two counts of deprivation of rights under color of law and one count of obstruction of justice.\n\nMitchell had initially been accused of forcing two women to engage in sexual activity in exchange for Mitchell not arresting them. The plea deal did not include any charges involving sexual assault or kidnapping.\n\nHowever, federal prosecutors say in their memo that Mitchell could have had no other motive besides wanting sex.\n\n\"More was going on that just Mitchell abusing the powers of his badge to only detain someone,\" the memo says. \"Mitchell took full advantage of the nature of the vice unit responsibilities to benefit his own selfish sexual vices.\"\n\nPart of the plea agreement was a jointly recommended sentencing range of between seven and 11 years in federal prison.\n\nMitchell's attorneys, Mark Collins and Kaitlyn Stephens, argue in a sentencing memo filed in advance of Thursday's hearing that the seven-year sentence is enough given Mitchell's lack of criminal history, the support of his family and the improbability of Mitchell ever repeating his behavior.\n\nThey said Mitchell would not have agreed to a plea deal had allegations of sexual activity been included.\n\n\"The defendant denies having had sex with prostitutes but does per the statement of facts ... acknowledges and takes responsibility for handcuffing the prosecuting witnesses and detaining them against their will,\" the document says.\n\n\"Andrew has never done something like this before,\" his attorneys wrote.\n\nAttached to the memo from Mitchell's defense team are letters from Mitchell's wife and other family members, as well as a retired detective who worked with Mitchell and current Columbus police Cmdr. Melissa McFadden.\n\nMitchell's attorneys said the time behind bars will let Mitchell be rehabilitated while also \"continuing to pay his debt to society for betraying society's trust as a law enforcement officer.\"\n\nProsecutors on the case asked U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus, who will sentence Mitchell, to impose the full 11-year sentence, noting that the agreed sentencing range is much lower than in other similar cases around the country.\n\nAndrew Mitchell: Former Columbus cop admits to holding women against their will, may get 11 years in prison\n\n\"Mitchell was hardly behaving consistent with his responsibilities as a Columbus Division of Police officer tasked with protecting and serving his community,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Mitchell was well aware of the special vulnerabilities of the sex workers and ... purposely targeted them in the belief that their complaints ... would not be believed.\"\n\n\"Mitchell routinely used this dynamic to his advantage ... in seeking sexual conquest and control while ignoring the law he was sworn to uphold,\" prosecutors wrote, saying Mitchell was \"an embarrassment to his badge.\"\n\nIn their memo, prosecutors said the two victims in the case remained willing to testify against Mitchell at a trial but wanted to resolve the case without having to if at all possible.\n\nMitchell admitted to a statement of facts that said he picked up the first woman in July 2017 in the Hilltop area where the woman was working as a sex worker. Mitchell, who was in plain clothes and did not have his badge, identified himself as a police officer and told the woman she was under arrest.\n\nThe woman told investigators Mitchell handcuffed her to a zip tie that was on the doorknob of his car before driving to a nearby area where Mitchell said there were no cameras.\n\n\"Mitchell then parked his car and continued to forcibly hold and detain (her) against her will for a period of time,\" the statement of facts says.\n\nA similar encounter was detailed for the second victim, who said Mitchell picked her up on two different occasions in September 2017. The second woman told investigators Mitchell showed her a badge, according to court records, and drove her to a nearby area where she was detained against her will.\n\nThe FBI's Public Corruption Task Force began investigating Mitchell in September 2018, weeks after Mitchell fatally shot 23-year-old Donna Dalton Castleberry while working undercover. A jury found Mitchell not guilty of any criminal charge in connection with Castleberry's Aug. 23, 2018, death.\n\nMitchell knew the investigation was underway by October 2018, when he began cleaning out an apartment at a rental property he owned with the goal of getting rid of evidence. Bleach was used in cleaning the apartment, court records say.\n\nFederal prosecutors said investigators determined that at least six women who had rented apartments from Mitchell admitted to having sex with him in exchange for money or reduced or free rent.\n\nMitchell's sentencing hearing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Thursday.\n\nbbruner@gannett.com", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Color (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Collins_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Collins (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Division_of_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Division of Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_charge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal charge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1Z.x7Hl2V02sOETKcNdhHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-columbus-dispatch/c758c81b42a12c551193eae2757155b4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-08-23", "textStart": 4547, "textEnd": 4560}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 3429, "textEnd": 3438}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-", "textStart": 4092, "textEnd": 4106}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-", "textStart": 4345, "textEnd": 4359}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 4618, "textEnd": 4630}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

When it came to choosing their favorite selection, here is why Schatz chose Mitchell:\n\nWide receivers Marvin Harrison Jr., Rome Odunze, and Malik Nabers were in a tier of their own, but in a loaded wide receiver class, many draft analysts had Mitchell as the first or second receiver in that second tier. It was almost assumed that he was going to be a first-round selection.\n\nIn a recent exercise to find which selections provided the Colts with the most 'value,' I compared each player's draft position to their ranking on the consensus big board. At +23, with a consensus ranking of 29th and being taken at 52nd overall, Mitchell was the best value selection for the Colts by those metrics.\n\nOn top of that, before taking Mitchell, the Colts traded back with Carolina, gaining two fifth-round picks in the process.\n\nThe Colts were very much in need of a playmaking presence at the receiver position, and Mitchell certainly provides that. Last season at Texas, Mitchell averaged 15.4 yards per catch with 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe also comes to the NFL with plenty of big game experience, playing in the College Football Playoffs in all three of his collegiate seasons, where he totaled 19 receptions at almost 16.0 yards per catch with six scores.\n\nWith 4.34 speed, Mitchell can provide that vertical presence that the Shane Steichen offense requires. However, with his route-running abilities, Mitchell is someone who can make an impact at all levels of the field and win in a variety of ways.\n\n\"I think for us, he's going to be pretty versatile as he was at Texas,\" said Colts' area scout Anthony Coughlan. \"He is a guy that can be a deep threat. He can run intermediate routes. This is a big dude. He's 205 pounds, running 4.38. So it's a multi-dimensional threat and he's a good route runner. He's not just a deep ball, 50/50, that's it. He can run routes, too. So, I think he can threaten multiple levels. We're extremely excited to get his talent here.\"\n\nMitchell has the potential to develop into a true No. 1 target in the passing game. Having that kind of presence on the field will create opportunities for others within the offense, such as Michael Pittman and Josh Downs, with the attention that Mitchell draws and the spacing he can create.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Odunze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome Odunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Nabers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malik Nabers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29th_National_Hockey_League_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "29th National Hockey League All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Steichen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Steichen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sdJUpIQHjV_crqFhv7TSGg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/indianapolis_colts_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_945/546bfc9d85d0352bb6808f85f07dbab2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Mitchell was not one of them.\n\nAnd yet, the lanky three-star receiver from Missouri City, Texas, had the audacity to believe he could compete at one of the top programs in the country. He even had the nerve to think he could play as a freshman for a team that would go on to win the national championship that fall.\n\nMitchell, who was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts with the 52nd overall pick last month, was right on both counts.\n\n\"He's got a lot of confidence in his own ability,\" said Texas coach Steve Sarkisian, who coached Mitchell in 2023 after his transfer from Georgia. \"I think the thing that you find out quickly when you get around him is the moment's never too big for him.\"\n\nColts Southwest area scout Anthony Coughlan, who studied Mitchell for the past year, had similar takeaways.\n\n\"He thinks he belongs,\" Coughlan said. \"He's got talent and he knows it.\"\n\nAll of which raises a couple of questions: Why did Mitchell, considered a top talent, slip out of the first round of the 2024 NFL draft? And what should we make of the concerns about his character expressed in some recent reports, sentiments that may have affected his draft stock?\n\nThose opinions prompted Colts general manager Chris Ballard to launch into a profanity-laced rant in defense of Mitchell during a post-draft news conference, saying, among other things, \"It's crap. This is a good kid. And for those reports to come out, it's bulls---.\"\n\nAmong the reports were claims that Mitchell interviewed poorly with teams and criticisms from league personnel about his preparation and attitude, according to separate accounts from NFL Network and longtime NFL reporter Bob McGinn.\n\nOn the other hand, those who have spent time around Mitchell painted a picture of a competitive 21-year-old whose edgy personality can sometimes be misinterpreted, a young father who adores his daughter, and a player whose teammates embraced him.\n\n\"We had a great experience with AD in his time here,\" Sarkisian said. \"We were better as a football team with him joining our team for one season, and I think he got better as a football player. I thought it was a win-win for both sides. I really enjoyed being around AD every day, whether in meetings or on the practice field. And he worked extremely hard, and I thought he improved his game.\"\n\nMitchell, who will debut at the Colts' rookie minicamp this weekend, excelled at Texas in 2023, turning in his best season with 55 receptions for 845 yards and 11 touchdowns. During his two seasons at Georgia (2021-22) and lone season with the Longhorns, Mitchell caught a touchdown in each of the five College Football Playoff games in which he appeared. Then, at the NFL scouting combine in March, he had a dazzling performance in physical testing. Mitchell's 4.34-second 40-yard dash was the third fastest among receivers, and his 11-foot, 4-inch broad jump was tops at the position.\n\nStill, Mitchell was the 11th receiver drafted in a deep class.\n\nBeing selected in the first round was important to Mitchell, but remaining on the board after Day 1 didn't shake him. According to a person close to him, Mitchell pulled himself together that evening and did the only thing he could: He went and worked out.\n\nWhen Ballard called Mitchell to inform him he was being selected by the Colts, Ballard asked, \"You tired of sitting around?\" He got a flavor of Mitchell's personality.\n\n\"The passion came out pretty clearly on the phone,\" Ballard said.\n\nOne complicating factor with Mitchell that was previously reported is how he has handled having Type 1 diabetes since being diagnosed at age 16. He has, at times, had challenges staying on track with his medication, which can significantly affect his mood. It's a common problem among diabetics and not something unique to Mitchell.\n\nTwo sources close to Mitchell told ESPN it's something he has focused on addressing. He recently hired a private chef and is adhering to a nutritional plan to help him better govern his diet relative to his diabetes.\n\nThe situation does not seem to be of concern to the Colts, who weighed the issues when evaluating Mitchell, according to team sources. The Colts' decision to move forward with selecting him is telling, given how much the organization has historically valued high-character players and held its draft picks to high standards.\n\nCase in point: The Colts had real reservations about another former Georgia receiver, 2022 second-round pick George Pickens, who was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pickens, who has developed into a solid receiver and had 1,140 yards last season, generated significant debate among teams before his draft because of concerns about his maturity.\n\nThe Colts seem to have viewed Mitchell in a different light. Part of their comfort level comes from relationships between members of the Colts' staff and staffers at Texas who helped the Colts access reliable information. Coach Shane Steichen and offensive assistants spent significant time consulting with Texas staffers and were on campus for the school's pro day.\n\nClearly, Mitchell has a fan in Sarkisian.\n\nThe coach spoke glowingly about how Mitchell embraced the new culture at Texas shortly after his arrival, something that can be challenging for a transfer. Mitchell, according to Sarkisian, \"bought into the things that we believe in\" at Texas. Mitchell has even committed to coming back to Texas to finish his degree after entering the draft following his junior year.\n\nWhen asked to describe a moment that he thought best described Mitchell's personality, Sarkisian's answer was revealing. Sarkisian turned immediately to Mitchell's relationship with his daughter, Icylinn.\n\n\"The way he takes care of his daughter and the compassion and love that he has for her, I think that's exactly who he was in our locker room and around our team,\" Sarkisian said. \"He's a compassionate guy.

If you think that's impressive, the list spans even further.\n\nMitchell has received numerous awards, including one from President Joe Biden, and is currently serving as a production team member for a contestant on The Voice. You may be wondering, what motivates him to accomplish all of this. To understand this, we must first take a dive into his early life.\n\nMitchell's story began in Decatur, where he grew up in a single-parent household, and the absence of his father left an impact on him during his early years.\n\n\"My dad wasn't really active... there were a lot of things that I had to learn,\" he said, explaining that the lack of his father's presence affected some aspects of his relationship with his mother.\n\n\"Me and my mom had a great relationship, but we had a lot of issues growing up,\" Mitchell said. \"I was really struggling with my biological father and my mother, trying to figure out what we're working with.\"\n\nThough Mitchell faced these struggles, he credits the community around him for providing a cast of mentors who could provide him with support as he grew up. When speaking about which individuals had the most impact on his life, he said that his community as a whole was influential in his life, and he could not limit that impact to one individual.\n\nFor example, a woman to whom he referred as \"Aunt B\" was a white lady who lived in his neighborhood growing up. The relationship between Mitchell, his brother and Aunt B began over a simple question. As the story goes, Mitchell and his brother were banging on the recycling bins like drums when Aunt B asked the two, \"Baby, do y'all want a popsicle?\" Mitchell said in his area this was unusual.\n\n\"In the neighborhood, my mom [said] you don't take anything from anybody... [that's] just how the culture was. But me and my brother didn't care, we just wanted a popsicle. So, we ran to the lady's house and got a popsicle.\"\n\nMitchell said forming this relationship with Aunt B opened his eyes to the harsh reality of the world.\n\n\"This is really when I started understanding what racism was,\" he said.\n\nMitchell described how Aunt B would take him and his brother places like the grocery store, and he did not understand the extra attention they would receive.\n\n\"I used to say, 'Hey, Aunt B, why are they looking at us?'\" he said.\n\nAunt B answered his question with reassurance, saying, \"Because we look different, and they can't understand that I love my chocolate babies.\"\n\nMitchell described this moment as his realization of the world around him.\n\nHe also credited the staff at the Decatur Youth Services program for the role they played in his future. He specifically mentioned how Bruce Jones, the director of the youth service, placed him into a tutoring role at the age of 16. Mitchell said that initially, he was reluctant to take on the role, saying that he was more interested in athletics. It was then that Jones asked Mitchell to sit at his desk and to put his feet up on the desk.\n\n\"You're going to be here one day,\" Jones told him.\n\nAmong his many roles, Mitchell now serves as the president of the Alabama Head Start Association. Though he was hesitant during his teenage years to envision himself in a role like that, Mitchell believes Jones' nudge helped mold his career path.\n\n\"I've been doing the same work that he taught me at 16 -- helping fathers, helping mothers with child support, and everything I learned at 16 I've been able to model for the state,\" he said. \"As a young African American kid, coming from the low-income environment I was in, I just needed a father's voice. He (Jones) was the first man.\"\n\nMitchell now seeks out ways to provide for others who may be longing for a paternal figure in their life. His foundation, \"A Father's Voice Matters,\" aims to accomplish just that. The foundation is focused on empowering fathers, assisting them to become better leaders and providing them with advice to raise their children in the most effective way possible.\n\n\"When I started working with fathers, I was working at a childcare resource center,\" he explained. \"I became the fatherhood director under Antione Harvis -- he had a voice -- his voice began to empower me to grow.\"\n\nMitchell credits his faith for his foundation's name.\n\n\"When I started the name, I feel like God just said... you cannot father your son if you don't hear my voice,\" he explained. \"One of the key components that happens is, if a child hears his father's voice, he'll move a little bit differently.\"\n\nAs a single parent, Mitchel understood he did not have all the answers, but he believed that leaning on his faith would help guide his path.\n\n\"I knew that there's a lot of choices in my life that I was still struggling with -- being a single parent and trying to figure things out,\" he said. \"I knew that I needed to get my walk with God to be stronger.\"\n\nMitchell said his work with area children who have absent fathers has shown him the power that an active and positive role model can have.\n\n\"There's something about a man's voice that can shake the room,\" he said. \"Because it's the discipline, it's like when you hear a lion roar, you aren't going to stand there. You're going to pay attention. You will figure out what it was.\"\n\nMitchell said he believes that having a father present and active is just the first step.\n\n\"The whole power of the movement is getting fathers just to be present with the voice. Because when you start talking, everything else comes from there,\" Mitchell said.\n\nHe highlighted the word \"hope\" as a basis for the goal of his foundation, and this is derived from the Steps of Hope grant for the Children's Trust fund that Mitchell supported. The grant got its name from a sermon that he wrote.\n\n\"I needed hope in coming from the struggles I was facing,\" Mitchell said. \"H is healing. In order for me to see my own hope and help these dads find their voice they had to be healed. I carried that brokenness into my adulthood, which did not help me in the beginning of my childhood faith in my kids, and so I had to heal myself so my kids can have hope for their future.\"\n\nAccording to Mitchell Once the healing process is complete a transition can be made to the next step.\n\n\"The second one is the O -- opportunity. I believe when a man is healed, he can successfully carry opportunity a whole lot bigger,\" he said.\n\nMitchell said that once a man is healed and can hold more opportunities, he should then pick a purpose, the P.\n\n\"How are you going to use your voice?\" he said. \"You can pick more than one [way], but you might want just [to start with] one. That's what that purpose will be telling you: Don't H-O-P, don't hop around too much. A man with many talents cannot master a skill of one.\"\n\nFor the final letter, Mitchell identified the energy as the meaning of E.\n\n\"When you heal, when you see an opportunity, you understand your purpose. It takes energy, and when you can get that energy, you create a hope for yourself every single day.\n\n\"My village at Auburn, Shepherd's Cove and other people in other communities, my after-school parents that I've had over the years -- that's who got me here,\" Mitchell said. \"And I think that's the hope. The healing came from people. Opportunities came from people. Purpose came through people and the energy came within people. So, I think that's why I have hope every day.\"\n\nEmpowering fathers is not the only thing on the agenda for Mitchell.\n\n\"We also have a mother's voice matters that we're getting ready to attach to it,\" he explained. \"I don't want to forget about the moms. I believe moms have a superpower that [men] just don't have.\"\n\nIn addition to his foundation, Mitchell serves as a District 3 representative for the Alabama Parent Advisory Council. Similar to his foundation, in his role as a representative Mitchell advocates for mothers and fathers in the district. Being a parent himself helps Mitchell present an accurate testimony of the impact a council decision will have.\n\n\"We get to have that parent's voice on it,\" he said. \"It's like, [saying] 'Hey, I don't think parents think this way or maybe you should add this wording to it.' So, we do grant reviews. A lot of the grants that you see working throughout the state of Alabama, we get a chance to review those grants and score those, and we ask are we seeing this in the neighborhood?\"\n\nThe platform has provided Mitchell with a voice to speak on his experiences and learn from others, Mitchell said.\n\n\"It's been a blessing to me because I get the chance to share that I was homeless,\" he said. \"I know what it feels like. Being able to use our lived experience stories to really connect with families all around the world.\"\n\nThroughout Mitchell's life, he has held to his faith. His journey took a pivotal turn when he moved out at the age of 16 and started to have a desire to understand his relationship with God. As he got older, he said he felt pressure to conduct himself in a certain way because of his faith.\n\n\"I remember seasons of my life in Christianity,\" he said. \"And so the season I am in now is ...how do I love people without the performance? How do I become who God's called me to be without feeling like I have to earn something? All my life I feel like I had to earn, and so in this season it's really [about] loving myself, even through the mistakes, even through the process, but also really trying to be the greatest example for the younger kids.\n\n\"My grandfather was a pastor, and that was my only dream -- to be like him,\" Mitchell said. He wanted to help people, and he tried to share his faith in many ways.\n\n\"It started with showing up to play drums when I was four or five years old, then singing -- that's when it started. I tried everything. I thought football was a way. I thought working with kids was a way,\" he said. \"When I became a youth pastor, I knew that I had a gift -- speaking.\"\n\nMitchell is now a national motivational speaker under Eric Thomas, one of the most influential motivational speakers and one of the inspirations for Mitchell to pursue a doctorate degree. Thomas holds a doctorate in theology, and according to Mitchell, his decision to pursue the same doctorate stemmed from his desire to grow in his faith.\n\nHe said he hopes to grow in his faith and influence by following the example of a familiar historical figure, Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"Martin Luther King is why I want to read the Bible the way I do, because I've said since they killed [him], I want to finish it. I want to start where [he] left off,\" Mitchell said. \"And I think that's where my heart goal was, stepping into political roles. I want to take the legacy that [MLK] really wanted to finish, and I want to do that for the community of all people.\"\n\nMitchell's work has not gone unnoticed. This year he received a number of awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the nation's Commander in Chief.\n\n\"I didn't know I was doing so much until you get a reward like that -- my mentor Tiffany McIntosh is the one who set all that up, she said, 'I just want you to be recognized,'\" he said.\n\nThough Mitchell is greatly honored by the award, he said his work is not merely for accolades or recognition. His primary drive is to help people, and while he is grateful for his award, he takes greater pleasure in seeing people benefit from his efforts to help them.\n\n\"The award is for me to really leverage to reach the voices of the kids,\" Mitchell said, explaining that's who he wants to influence.\n\nMitchell is currently working on a team to create content for The Voice contestant Asher Havon, whom he met during a Church of the Highlands gospel event. Mitchell impressed Havon with his photography skills and was brought to the team to produce an album cover.\n\n\"I learned that skill [photography] and I put that skill to [work] with Asher and have just been able to be a brother to him,\" Mitchell said. \"It's been a fun experience, but here's the greatest part: I brought a team with me.\"\n\nMitchell brought along some of his production team to assist and spoke very highly of his crew. When Mitchell refers to his group of people as a team, that word holds immense value in his eyes.\n\n\"Giving them opportunities has been a blessing for me,\" he said. \"I think the greatest leader is the one who can send out a great team better than him. These guys are creative. They're talented. I just get blessed to put it under my team name. I tell them, there's nobody behind me. We're all side by side. And if I win, you win,\" he said.\n\nWith all that Mitchell has accomplished so far, you would wonder what is up next for him.\n\n\"I don't want to know where I want to be in five years,\" he said. \"I think I want to be where God wants me to be.\"\n\nThough he doesn't know exactly where he will be, Mitchell said he knows the legacy he would like to leave behind.\n\n\"It is just building something that can last,\" he said. \"And so, I just think that's where I am. I want to see myself make good decisions, helping change policies, helping families, and just really trying to make the world a better place and really make Martin Luther King Jr. proud at the end of the day.\"", "source": {"uri": "opelikaobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Opelika Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Jones_(comics)", "type":

Your friend discusses his lack of finesse and consistency in his routes. The eavesdropping bartender points out that Mitchell never missed the College Football Playoff in his collegiate career, showing that he brings a winning element to a roster. The far-from-sober regular across the room mentions that he wasn't the top receiving option in Georgia or Texas.\n\nThe reality is that all of those reasons, to various extents, factored into Mitchell's second-round draft capital. He did, however, land with a potentially blossoming offense under second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson.\n\nThere have not been very many wide receivers that have entered the NFL with Mitchell's blend of speed and size. His 4.34 40-yard dash time trailed only his college teammate Xavier Worthy and LSU's Brian Thomas Jr. for wide receivers in this draft class. He measured in at 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds. Unfortunately for him, there are very few cases of receivers with that speed and weight who have succeeded in the league. Seattle's D.K. Metcalf is essentially the only exception.\n\nMitchell flashes the ability to beat coverage with his athletic attributes. Mitchell scored twice on three catches against Alabama and future top draft picks Terrion Arnold and Kool-Aid McKinstry. That's NFL against NFL talent. However, there was seemingly less intensity in low-profile matchups.\n\nScoring touchdowns was rarely an issue. Mitchell snagged 11 of them, often displaying his dynamic footwork and size in the red zone. He was largely uninvolved outside the red zone and the occasional deep pass. Mitchell caught more than three passes in just four of his 14 games last season. In three out of those four games, he topped 100 receiving yards (the lone exception was the CFP Semifinal against Washington). When he's locked in, he is as talented as any wide receiver in this draft.\n\nIn his two-year tenure at Georgia, Mitchell was largely outplayed by fellow second-round pick Ladd McConkey, although the latter dealt with a lingering ankle issue in his second season. Between McConkey and first-round tight end Brock Bowers, Mitchell was, at best, the third option in the passing game. It was a similar story in Texas' capital, where Mitchell competed for targets with Worthy.\n\nRegardless of where Mitchell fell in the pecking order at Georgia or Texas, he made winning plays. Mitchell contributed to back-to-back national championships for the Bulldogs and scored in all four playoff games. In his lone season in Austin, the Longhorns made their debut in football's final four. To the surprise of nobody, he continued his CFP scoring streak.\n\nCould Mitchell again show up on the NFL's biggest stage? The Colts were nearly a playoff team in 2023 and are constructing a roster that rivals other AFC playoff teams.\n\nMitchell should essentially replace Alec Pierce in the Indianapolis offense. Michael Pittman Jr. is the alpha and will be drafted as a top-12 fantasy football wideout. He's developed into one of the best route runners in the NFL. Josh Downs strung together respectable games in the first half of his rookie season but faded quickly down the stretch. Whether Downs or Mitchell emerges as second fiddle to Pittman, the duo shouldn't compete for playing time, only targets. Downs operated out of the slot on 610 of his 828 snaps last season. Mitchell was primarily an outside receiver in college.\n\nWe still don't know what kind of passer Anthony Richardson will be as a professional. Injuries (notably a season-ending one to his throwing shoulder) shut down his debut season after just 84 pass attempts. Fifty of those passes were completed for a mediocre 59.5% completion rating. Richardson is reportedly healthy and will participate in OTAs but we can't yet rely on him to routinely connect with Mitchell on deep passes. If Mitchell doesn't get open early in his route, Richardson may as well take off running, the more notable aspect of his game.\n\nLike any deep ball threat, Pierce was consistent... in not delivering large quantities of fantasy points. Pierce averaged fewer than two receptions per game and only put up the points when securing a long touchdown reception. Again, they aren't a one-to-one replica of each other. Mitchell is far more talented on paper and can excel in other areas when he shows the proper motivation.\n\nSimply put, Mitchell may be a better real-life football player than a fantasy asset. He's not a reliable winner against zone defenses (1.75 yards per route run, 15.2% target share), relies on his body to secure passes despite a strong set of hands, and needs bulk yardage on limited reception numbers. All signs point to Mitchell being a boom-or-bust wide receiver. The potential for booms will help unlock Richardson and the Indianapolis offense. The potential for busts could, in turn, doom fantasy managers who start Mitchell.\n\nMitchell is better suited as a second option in this league. The ideal landing spot would have been a team with an established quarterback that also needed a second wide receiver (division rival Jacksonville comes to mind if they passed on Brian Thomas Jr.). Richardson may be locked in the Colts' plans, but passing and injury question marks remain. In his two complete games as a rookie, his second receiver didn't get anywhere close to a top-36 finish. In his Week 4 contest against the Rams, Richardson didn't provide a wideout with a top-60 placement.\n\nDepending on players who rely on deep-ball receptions is a fool's errand. Fantasy managers who have rostered Gabe Davis anytime over the course of his career understand. Even one of the most prolific boom-or-bust wideouts since the turn of the millennium, DeSean Jackson, had his frustrating outings. That's not to say that Mitchell only profiles as a boom-or-bust wide receiver, that's just his MO right now. He has the time and skillset to blossom into an all-around, elite talent. But if he doesn't improve his consistency and refine his strengths and weaknesses, he could remain a what-if for an all-time athlete.\n\nLike what you see?

When it came to choosing their favorite selection, here is why Schatz chose Mitchell:\n\n\"Wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to the Indianapolis Colts at No. 52. Analytics suggest there is no such thing as a \"draft steal\" because prospects drop from consensus for good reasons. That being said, Mitchell might have dropped due to off-field concerns, and Colts GM Chris Ballard spoke out against that. This was the No. 5 wide receiver in Playmaker Score but the No. 11 receiver off the board.\"\n\n[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nWide receivers Marvin Harrison Jr., Rome Odunze, and Malik Nabers were in a tier of their own, but in a loaded wide receiver class, many draft analysts had Mitchell as the first or second receiver in that second tier. It was almost assumed that he was going to be a first-round selection.\n\nIn a recent exercise to find which selections provided the Colts with the most 'value,' I compared each player's draft position to their ranking on the consensus big board. At +23, with a consensus ranking of 29th and being taken at 52nd overall, Mitchell was the best value selection for the Colts by those metrics.\n\nOn top of that, before taking Mitchell, the Colts traded back with Carolina, gaining two fifth-round picks in the process.\n\nThe Colts were very much in need of a playmaking presence at the receiver position, and Mitchell certainly provides that. Last season at Texas, Mitchell averaged 15.4 yards per catch with 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe also comes to the NFL with plenty of big game experience, playing in the College Football Playoffs in all three of his collegiate seasons, where he totaled 19 receptions at almost 16.0 yards per catch with six scores.\n\nWith 4.34 speed, Mitchell can provide that vertical presence that the Shane Steichen offense requires. However, with his route-running abilities, Mitchell is someone who can make an impact at all levels of the field and win in a variety of ways.\n\n\"I think for us, he's going to be pretty versatile as he was at Texas,\" said Colts' area scout Anthony Coughlan. \"He is a guy that can be a deep threat. He can run intermediate routes. This is a big dude. He's 205 pounds, running 4.38. So it's a multi-dimensional threat and he's a good route runner. He's not just a deep ball, 50/50, that's it. He can run routes, too. So, I think he can threaten multiple levels. We're extremely excited to get his talent here.\"\n\nMitchell has the potential to develop into a true No. 1 target in the passing game. Having that kind of presence on the field will create opportunities for others within the offense, such as Michael Pittman and Josh Downs, with the attention that Mitchell draws and the spacing he can create.", "source": {"uri": "coltswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colts Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bretl@coltswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Paul Bretl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonai_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adonai Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Outsiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football Outsiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ballard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Ballard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Nabers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malik Nabers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Steichen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Steichen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://coltswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/03/1829595058.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

There's been days we've kept him out for precautionary reasons.\n\n\"But it's good when we go live and let him go and throw the ball deep to him, he makes some big plays. He's going to help us. That's why he's here -- to really boost this wide receiver room. And it was good to see him score a touchdown today.\"\n\nMitchell was a standout in Notre Dame's annual exhibition. His biggest moment came with less than five minutes left in the game when he hauled in a 62-yard touchdown reception to secure a 28-21 win for his team.\n\nAfter the scrimmage, Mitchell reflected on the highlight play.\n\n\"I got the signal, and it was like a double move, so I was like, 'Yeah, this is coming to me,\" Mitchell explained. \"Me and Steve have talked before and were like, 'We're going to make a play today.' I saw that was the opportunity that the DB (defensive back) had his eyes on me, and I knew if I made a good enough break that he was going to jump on it and the ball was going to be right there after my break.\"\n\nMitchell is no stranger to massive plays. In the 2023 campaign at FIU, Mitchell tallied 64 catches for 1,118 yards, seven touchdowns and 17.5 yards per catch. In four seasons with the program, Mitchell boasts 100 catches for 1,663 yards, 12 touchdowns and 16.6 yards per catch.\n\nNow, Kris Mitchell will look to find similar success at Notre Dame. Freeman is certainly happy with the direction the program is heading.\n\n\"I think I'm really pleased with what we've added to this roster in terms of our wideout room,\" Freeman said. \"I'm confident in the guys that we have returning in this wideout room, but I'm also confident the guys that we brought in to really elevate the room as a whole.\n\n\"I believe this probably is, I want to say, one of the most talented rosters we've had since I've been here, right? Now, it's our job to build that talent and mold that talent and make sure we teach that talent to get to where we want to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_grubbs@on3.com", "name": "Grant Grubbs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIU_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIU Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/20194752/mitchell.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Mitchell, 60, of Sunbury, pleaded guilty in December 2023 to two counts of depriving individuals of their civil rights while acting under color of law and one count of obstructing justice.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio - A former Columbus vice detective was sentenced in federal court today to 132 months in prison for crimes related to kidnapping victims under the guise of an arrest.\n\n\"As a member of the vice unit and a long-serving police officer, Mitchell was well aware of the special vulnerabilities of the sex workers and often drug addicted females with which he came into contact,\" said U.S. Attorney Kenneth L. Parker. \"Instead of helping them seek refuge, Mitchell was the type of predator who purposely targeted these women. The U.S. Attorney's Office is dedicated to upholding the community's work to connect victimized women to services and to prosecuting those who prey on vulnerable victims, no matter who they are.\"\n\nMitchell was employed by the Columbus Division of Police from 1988 until 2019 and was assigned to the vice unit from 2017 until 2019. As part of his duties in that role, Mitchell conducted law enforcement actions for solicitation offenses.\n\nMitchell used this ruse to handcuff the victim to the doorknob of his vehicle. He drove the victim to a nearby parking lot with multiple dumpsters and forcible held and detained the victim against her will before dropping her off at her boyfriend's residence.\n\nAccording to court documents, in July 2017, Mitchell picked up a sex worker who was working in the Hilltop near Sullivant and Whitethorne avenues. Mitchell was in plain clothes and an unmarked black sedan. He told the victim he was a police officer and acted as if he were doing a check for any outstanding warrants on the victim.\n\nMitchell kidnapped the victim and drove her to Lindbergh Park, holding her against her will.\n\nSimilarly, in September 2017, Mitchell picked up a second sex worker in the Hilltop. Mitchell was again in plain clothes and was driving a dark SUV. He began discussing the victim's rates for sexual activity before announcing that he was an officer with the vice unit and said she was going to jail.\n\nMitchell was charged federally and arrested in March 2019.\n\nMitchell was also sentenced today for obstructing justice. Specifically, during the federal investigation into Mitchell's civil rights crimes, he directed several individuals to assist him in cleaning out one of the rental properties he owned, located on Denune Ave. The individuals disposed of evidence including photos, clothing, bedding and rental records, and used bleach extensively in the apartment to clean a bed, couch, ottoman and floor.\n\n# # #\n\nKenneth L.

A former member of the boy band Intersection, the soft-spoken solo artist built a successful career in Japan before his breakthrough in China on the \"American Idol\"-style reality TV show \"Chuang 2021.\"\n\n\"I want to keep building my brand in China, slowly expand across Asia, and find different companies to support me in different countries,\" said Mitchell, who recently appeared in GQ China and modeled for a Valentino campaign in the country. \"I want to work toward the U.S. market as well, but it's a hard market to just barge into.\"\n\nDespite the early professional success, Mitchell, 23, said he was shocked to gain admittance to Harvard College. He set aside the bustling performance career and attended his first classes in fall 2019, making fast friends with other first-years in the Yard.\n\n\"He told me like a month in, 'I'm really famous abroad,'\" recalled friend and former housemate Chris Wang '23. \"I thought that was really funny.\"\n\nConcentrating in economics was an act of pure pragmatism, Mitchell said. But earning a music secondary left a little room for pursuing personal interests in theory and experimentation. The course \"Storytelling With Sounds,\" led by composer and Fanny P. Mason Professor of Music Hans Tutschku, was a highlight.\n\n\"It was basically a class where we recorded sounds from everyday life, and then used those sounds to create abstract music,\" Mitchell said.\n\nAccording to Tutschku, Mitchell's strong musical foundation and cross-cultural background helped him succeed in a course designed to challenge convention. \"What they learn is to listen differently,\" Tutschku explained. \"They learn to listen to the world differently, listen to sounds differently, and accept or use sounds in a different way.\"\n\nMitchell was born in New York City and picked up his first musical instrument -- the flute -- after watching Disney's \"The Little Mermaid.\"\n\n\"I really loved that movie, and I wanted to be the prince,\" he recalled.\n\nAt age 8, Mitchell moved with his family to Tokyo, where he and a younger sister were enrolled in public schools. \"Up until that point, I didn't really know any Japanese,\" said Mitchell, who often appears under the name Kaz. \"After a year, though, I kind of picked it up and now Japanese is basically my native language as well as English.\"\n\nHe was just 13 when he joined up with Intersection, a four-boy power pop ensemble featuring a blend of Japanese and Western elements.\n\n\"All of us were mixed -- half Japanese and half something else -- and all of us spoke English,\" said Mitchell, who has a white American father and Japanese mother.\n\nIt took about four years of rehearsals until Intersection was ready. Mitchell had just graduated from high school, in 2019, when the group debuted with an album of English-language songs. Their first music video, \"Starting Over,\" played up their youth, with the bandmates rollicking about one of Japan's many \"cat islands,\" where feline residents outnumber people.\n\nMitchell also appeared during a gap year on the popular Japanese reality series \"Is She the Wolf?\" The reality dating show, familiar to U.S. audiences from subsequent seasons that stream on Netflix, features five men and five women, with a single foil planted among the latter.\n\nSpurred by the pandemic, Mitchell took a break during the 2020-21 academic year to appear on \"Chiang 2021\" and record a solo EP titled \"Code Love.\" The six-song collection is far more eclectic than anything Mitchell released with Intersection. He collaborated with Japanese actress and singer Hikari Mitsushima on \"Drown,\" a track featuring lush layers of acoustics, electronics, and bilingual vocals. Also noteworthy is \"Summer Is Over,\" an R&B-infused duet with 2023 Harvard grad Mai Anna that has serious lo-fi allure.\n\nResuming coursework in Cambridge left him feeling divided, Mitchell said. \"I couldn't really communicate with my company in Japan. I couldn't really make the most of my connections.\"\n\nLast year he signed a three-year contract with Beijing-based Longtao Entertainment. To make the most of this opportunity, he opted to spend his final semester studying abroad in China, bolstering his Mandarin skills by day while spending nights performing, attending industry events, and working on new music, including a pop-driven single due out any day.\n\nBut he retains fond memories of Harvard, where everyday life was closer to normal. \"He's more introverted than people would expect,\" Wang observed. \"He deals with being a celebrity when he's out and about in China, but I think in college he appreciated alone time.\"\n\nUntil somebody would recognize the pop star on campus again. \"There were a couple of times where my photo got taken in the Science Center,\" Mitchell said. \"I had to issue a statement on Weibo -- the Chinese social media site -- and be like, 'Hey, if you want to take my photo, just talk to me. Don't take it without me knowing.'\"\n\nWang, who speaks Mandarin, eventually resolved to protect his reserved friend from the most aggressive intrusions. \"I got really good at telling people to back off,\" he said. \"I'd always step in front of the camera and ruin their picture.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.harvard.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Harvard Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This is a good kid. And for those reports to come out, it's bulls--t.\"\n\nMitchell is joining what seems to be an organization on the rise, as the Colts improved to 9-8 last season after going just 4-12-1 in 2022.\n\nThat improvement occurred despite 2023 first-round pick and starting quarterback Anthony Richardson missing 13 games due to injury during his rookie campaign.\n\nWith Richardson back in the fold in 2024 and surrounded by weapons such as Pittman, Downs, Mitchell and superstar running back Jonathan Taylor, the Colts have a chance to surprise and return to the playoffs for the first time since 2020.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_chiari@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Mike Chiari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonai_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adonai Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 1 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Richardson_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Richardson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pittman_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Pittman Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Art", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Art", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Dietary_Options", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Dietary Options", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_160,y_88,w_1546,h_1029,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715256623/hnbtsffqgemf1vavpuny.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

But Mitchell should want no part of it, and honestly, Houston may not, either. The Rockets are bristling with young talent, but they should avoid substantial changes until they have a better grasp on just how good building blocks like Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn and Jalen Green can be. Similarly, if Mitchell wants out of Cleveland -- where the Cavs have won 60.4 percent of their games since his September 2022 arrival -- he'd presumably want into a situation that's more conducive to contention than Houston's current state.\"\n\nAdding Mitchell to the Rockets could make them better, but the team would have to be configured completely different to cater to his ball-handling needs. Jalen Green would certainly have to be in the deal, and Amen Thompson could also be a requirement for the Cavaliers. That's a hefty price for the Rockets to pay.\n\nUltimately, Mitchell could find a new home in the offseason, but Houston should stay the course with its young core and turn down any enticing opportunities to cash in for a win-now player before seeing what the group can actually accomplish together.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_brener@si.com", "name": "Jeremy Brener", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alperen_\u015eeng\u00fcn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Green", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Art", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Art", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Outdoor_Play", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Outdoor Play", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5324,h_2994,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_rockets/01hxchymhezh7gn3d0ck.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

That was in evidence Wednesday afternoon at the Mitchell Performing Arts Center, where students were recognized for academic excellence and other achievements during the Mitchell High School Awards Assembly.\n\nDozens of students were recognized in over 20 categories during the program.\n\nAmong the recognitions were the announcement of the 2024 Boys State and Girls State representatives from Mitchell High School. Linda Holmes, president of the auxiliary for American Legion Post 18 in Mitchell, said the five selectees this year will again represent Mitchell High School as they study the finer points of South Dakota government at the city, county and state levels.\n\n\"Girls State brings together the best girls from all over the state of South Dakota to experience a week of intensive training and citizenship and government. In essence, Girls State is focused on character development,\" Holmes said.\n\nThe five students that will represent Mitchell at Girls State were announced as Alexa Chapman, Kaylie Fuert, Grace Hempel, Lauren Hofer and Camryn Swanstrom.\n\nHugh Holmes, also with the American Legion Post 18, revealed the names of the students who will represent Mitchell at Boys State this year.\n\n\"Boys State is a citizenship training program. The American Legion believes that for democracy to flourish, our young men must have an understanding of the American way of life,\" Hugh Holmes said. \"The objective of Boys State is to help youth better understand and appreciate the American system of government and way of life, including the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\"\n\nThe 2024 Mitchell representatives to Boys State were announced as Joshua Machado, Sutton Thompson, Floyd Korzan, Noah Pudwill, Max Hart and Alfredo Salcido.\n\nAnother group recognition went to the Spanish National Honor Society.\n\nTeri Morgan, who spoke during that recognition, said the group of 20 students would be greatly missed when they move on from her classes after this year.\n\n\"I will definitely miss all of these students next year,\" Morgan said. \"We become like a little family because I have them for three years, and it's pretty emotional. I just want to tell them thanks for being great kids. Muchas gracias!\"\n\nA number of individual academic awards were given out as well, including awards for science and culinary arts.\n\nTricia Neugebauer spoke on behalf of the science department at Mitchell High School. She said this year's Science Award recipient, Allison Rasmussen, had deftly navigated the highest levels of science taught at the school.\n\n\"This student not only took every advanced science course we have to offer, but they excelled obviously in every single one. Not only that, what put them apart is that they have a thirst for understanding the world around them and in them,\" Neugebauer said. \"And that's what really set her apart.\"\n\nCindy Gerlach presented the award for Top Culinary Arts and Management.\n\nJay Melmer, the recipient of the award, was praised for being both an excellent student and a solid assistant in the classroom. Those features made him stand out for the award, Gerlach said.\n\n\"This is a student who has gone above and beyond and taken a number of my classes,\" Gerlach said. \"This student has also been kind of my right hand person just all the time and in different things.\"\n\nThe ceremony closed out Wednesday afternoon with the HOBY Awards.\n\nThe four students chosen to receive the distinction -- Maddie Childs, Katie Hohn, Mallory Miedema and Jordan Platt -- will represent Mitchell High School at an upcoming HOBY Leadership Seminar in June.\n\nBobby Reindl, assistant principal for Mitchell High School, who presented the awards, noted that the selection of four students instead of a single student represents a change from past HOBY Awards at Mitchell High School.\n\n\"Each year, the Mitchell High School faculty selects a sophomore as a representative to the Hugh O'Brian Leadership Seminar. This year, Mitchell High School took a different approach and four students will be attending the seminar,\" Reindl said. \"The selected students will take part in leadership training, service learning and motivational building experiences.They will learn social responsibility and how they can make a difference and what it means to be a global citizen.\"\n\nReindl said all the students recognized Wednesday afternoon are an example of both the quality of students at Mitchell High School and the quality of education available in the Mitchell School District.\n\n\"I am very proud of the quality of education that our students receive at Mitchell High School, and I feel this recognition signifies the hard work the students and staff implement throughout Mitchell schools,\" Reindl said.\n\nSeveral student awards were handed out Wednesday afternoon.

In a sentencing memorandum filed April 26, defense council cited Mitchell's age, character and having no prior record among the reasons for a lighter sentence.\n\nMitchell, who was originally charged with three counts of depriving civil rights, five counts of tampering with a witness, victim, or informant, two counts of influence, and one count of destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure, pleaded guilty on Dec. 7 to two counts of depriving civil rights and one count of tampering with a witness.\n\nThe judge also sentenced Mitchell, who was ordered to pay $300 in restitution, to five years of supervised release for the two counts of depriving civil rights and three years of supervised release for tampering with a witness.\n\nThe charges stem from a lawsuit claiming that Mitchell used unlawful excessive force when he shot Castleberry multiple times, causing her death.\n\nCastleberry died during what was originally described as an undercover prostitution operation. Police said Mitchell was attempting to take Castleberry into custody inside of an unmarked vehicle in the area of Bellows and South Yale Avenue. Police said Castleberry stabbed Mitchell in the hand in the moments leading up to the shooting.\n\nMitchell was accused of kidnapping two women under the guise of arrest for prostitution, and then forcing them to perform sexual acts for their freedom. He was indicted on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in April 2019. One week later he was indicted on federal charges.\n\nA Franklin County jury cleared Mitchell in April 2023. However, a the federal case awaited him. He pleaded not guilty, and previously rejected a plea deal offered at the end of November before changing his plea to guilty in December.\n\nHours after Mitchell changed his plea, the Columbus Division of Police released a statement about its former officer.\n\n\"Andrew Mitchell betrayed his oath, the values of the Columbus Division of Police and the trust of our community. He used his position to target and exploit some of the most vulnerable in our community. We hope the close of this dark, painful chapter brings some measure of peace to everyone he wronged.\"\n\nThe former Vice Unit officer went to trial twice in Franklin County Common Pleas Court for the killing of Castleberry, before being found not guilty of murder and voluntary manslaughter. In the initial proceedings in April 2022, the judge declared a mistrial when the jury reported three separate times that it was deadlocked.", "source": {"uri": "nbc4i.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC4i"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_conn@nbc4i.com", "name": "Adam Conn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Ohio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voluntary manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Division_of_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Division of Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.nbc4i.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2023/04/Featured-Image-2023-04-17T083317.638.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 556, "textEnd": 564}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-07", "textStart": 944, "textEnd": 950}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 1967, "textEnd": 1977}], "sentiment": -0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Now his career is on life support. Will he even make the team?\n\nIt wasn't long ago that the 49ers liked Mitchell so much that they got rid of Raheem Mostert, who signed with the Dolphins and scored a league-leading 21 touchdowns last season. Mostert has been able to stay healthy in Miami, something he couldn't do on the 49ers, and Mitchell has been constantly banged up.\n\nThat's why the 49ers traded for Christian McCaffrey. They simply couldn't rely on Mitchell anymore, because he misses so many games. And even when he's on the field, he's still not 100 percent healthy.\n\nSo the 49ers hope Mitchell could be McCaffrey's backup. But last season, Mitchell averaged just 3.7 yards per carry in the regular season and a mere 2.5 yards per carry in the playoffs. Meanwhile, the 49ers have Jordan Mason who averaged 5.2 yards per carry in the regular season and 6.0 yards per carry in the playoffs.\n\nIn addition, the 49ers just traded up in Round 4 to draft running back Isaac Guerendo who runs a 4.33, plus they signed UDFA running back Cody Schrader who was the SEC's leading rusher last season. Which means Mitchell has real competition to make the team this season. If he gets injured and misses most of training camp as he has in the past, he might not make the team.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Mostert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Mostert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5267,h_2962,x_0,y_70/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01hxd8dnk3z0d4dpn60r.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

He'd escaped his crazy calendar. He strode the stage of the NFL Draft in Detroit, then taxied to Philadelphia's airport twice in two days. He still found time to clear his mind on a road trip from Toledo, Ohio, through the full length of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe No. 22 overall pick arrived to the Philadelphia Eagles' rookie minicamp last weekend. Afterward, Mitchell returned home to Williston, Fla., as he promised he would. He celebrated with four sisters, three he helped raise. He visited kids who played in the youth league in which he'd been an inaugural player. He survived the turbulence of his small town by binding himself to its tranquility, by committing himself quietly to the people who loved him unconditionally.\n\n\"That guy don't even talk,\" said Keith Hardee, a family friend who's known Mitchell all his life. \"He'll just smile and look at you.\"\n\nThere's strength beneath that smile. Don't let his silence fool you. David May, a former assistant football coach at Williston High, says Mitchell would utter maybe five words during the school day. But come weight room time, \"It was like you'd just turned the light on.\"\n\nThe skinny kid could squat over 400 pounds. He'd dominate 5:30 a.m. workouts and crack-of-dawn competitions in which the last person to steal the fabric flag from the ankle of a teammate's shoe took home a makeshift title belt. Mitchell lost once. And he stewed like it was the Super Bowl.\n\n\"Something even as stupid as a belt,\" May said. \"He hated losing.\"\n\nRic Whittington, another former Williston assistant, gave Mitchell rides to school. He'd pull up the road and flash his brights. Sometimes those headlights gave Whittington a glimpse into Mitchell's world. In a family that managed the best it could, Mitchell partly grew up in his grandmother's house near the dead end of a gravel-rock road. It was a safe space, Marilyn Johnson's home. It was a place where principles of honesty, respect and loyalty formed a conviction within Mitchell that helped him avoid the calamities surrounding him. Few in Williston knew how much Mitchell dealt with, since his words hardly revealed anything.\n\nJustin Wentworth, Mitchell's head coach at Williston, once tore into Mitchell for giving him some attitude. Whittington tapped Wentworth on the shoulder and pulled him aside. He hasn't eaten all day, Coach. Mom's at work. Grandma's sick. Sisters are sick. He's had to take care of them.\n\nThat was Mitchell. After Hurricane Irma devastated Florida in 2017, Mitchell rode around Williston in the back of a coach's truck handing out PB&Js to anyone hungry. He helped the school start a meal program for athletes who shared his experience. He'd empty himself. Several nights a week, an exhausted Mitchell fell asleep on May's couch after playing video games and eating dinner with other teammates at the coach's house.\n\n\"Whatever he does in life, whether it's in the NFL or running his own company, he's going to be successful because of how he's persevered,\" May said. \"He knows that fighting for what you want is the only way in life.\"\n\nIf a young Mitchell ever wanted to know what it was like to be a professional athlete from Williston, all he needed to do was open his back door.\n\nJiwan James lived close enough to hurl a baseball and hit Mitchell's house. Drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 22nd round of the 2007 MLB Draft, James played nine seasons in their minor league system. Every winter, he'd return home to Williston, 20 miles south of Gainesville, where he'd been a local legend in a town with a population just above 3,000. As Wentworth puts up, Williston \"is straight out of a Tim McGraw song.\" There are three stoplights. Two of them are flashing.\n\nAthletes must be astounding to keep recruiters from just passing through -- if they drive by at all. James, an all-state selection in baseball, basketball and football at Williston High, attracted enough attention to turn down a scholarship offer from Florida and sign with the Phillies. He loved the bus rides to little-known cities, playing before thousands of fans and interacting with kids who looked up to him. He loved returning home and spending time with his nephew, Jeremiah, and the quiet kid with whom Jeremiah was inseparable.\n\n\"How is it?\" Mitchell once asked about playing professionally.\n\nCould Mitchell shine bright enough to leave Williston? His grandfather had been fast enough to earn the nickname \"Speed Buggy.\" His father, Quentin, had been a running back at Troy. But there was a time when Mitchell's family worried he was too small to play football. There was a time when there wasn't a competitive youth league.\n\nHardee, who coached Quentin at Williston, says they were sitting on the porch together when they decided to start their own football program. Excited, but devoid of resources, they relied on donations and connections. They chose a vacant park as their home field. They asked a buddy who was a groundskeeper for the University of Florida's football games to lay down the chalk. They didn't charge anyone who joined the league. They just put up signs that said come to the park and play.\n\nAnd there was a 7-year-old \"Buggy,\" whom Hardee thought had only earned half of his grandfather's nickname.\n\n\"We didn't know which way he was going to run,\" Hardee laughed. \"But he started it off running 85 yards for a touchdown.\"\n\nLater, on the road to the airport for the NFL combine, Mitchell turned down the radio and asked Hardee if he'd finally call him \"Speed Buggy.\" Well, let's see how you run.\n\nMitchell ran a 4.33 in the 40-yard dash, tied for the third-fastest time in this year's event.\n\nBorn in West Philly, Hank Poteat, who retired from the NFL in 2010, returned to the Delaware Valley to try out a career in sports media. Garry Cobb, a former Eagles linebacker and radio analyst on WIP-FM, secured a role for Poteat where he'd appear on a segment every now and then. It didn't stick. Poteat decided to coach, and, after a six-year climb through the college ranks, landed a gig coaching Toledo's cornerbacks on Jason Candle's staff in 2017.\n\nOne of the Toledo assistants on the recruiting trail sent Poteat a video of a prospect. He loved what he saw. He always preferred players who shared a do-it-all background that showcased the full range of their capabilities. The kid was more than a cornerback. He returned kicks and punts and played running back. Sure, Williston was a class 1A program. But it was one of the few small schools in the area that had 22 starters who didn't have to play both ways. Poteat couldn't believe Mitchell wasn't yet on anyone else's radar.\n\nThree months after Poteat landed a commitment from Mitchell, his sleeper prospect was no longer a secret. Mitchell attended a Florida recruiting camp and ran a 4.3 in the 40-yard dash. Arizona State offered. Mitchell de-committed. But as his senior year at Williston dragged along, Power 5 schools moved on when it became clear he wouldn't qualify academically.\n\nJames, who briefly worked at Williston, said Mitchell wasn't inherently a bad student. It was just about managing priorities. One time, an assistant coach dumped Mitchell's book bag out in front of him. Every assignment he was missing was in the bottom of his backpack. Most had been completed. Man, just turn in your work. Mitchell still needed to take an extra semester to qualify.\n\nWhittington, who returned as Williston's head coach, watched Mitchell disappear into studies with teachers and administrators. Other former assistants and family friends kept tabs, too. That was a moment when Mitchell could've easily chosen to fade away, they say. That was a moment when Toledo could've easily chosen to forget him. But when Mitchell rectified his grades, Poteat offered a delayed scholarship that would begin in 2020.\n\nThe name, image and likeness era erupted a year later. The transfer portal became a largely unregulated madhouse, as the NCAA battled legislation that addressed inequities they had long ignored. Mitchell rebuffed offers even after transforming into a two-time All-American at Toledo. Nick Saban said on ESPN's draft-day broadcast that Mitchell would've been Alabama's No. 1 target in the transfer portal, \"and he would never get in the transfer portal.\"\n\n\"Toledo just kind of stuck with me,\" Mitchell said. \"So that just showed me, be there for those who are there for you.\"\n\nMaxen Hook awoke at 4 a.m. to the sound of his roommate banging on his door.\n\n\"Yo, Max!\" Mitchell hollered. \"Open the door!\"\n\nTheir apartment was flooding. A pipe had burst. Water pooled in the hallway.\n\nHook tried calling maintenance. There was no answer until daybreak. After the apartment was finally drained, the whole place smelled horrible. Days passed. Mold sprouted. Festered. The landlord insisted the Toledo teammates could live in such conditions. Until Hook threatened to sue.\n\nThey moved to a place 10 minutes from campus. A place with a pool. A place with a washer and dryer. Not bad for a couple of college kids who became friends just before the COVID-19 pandemic. They lived together for 4 1/2 years, mostly in that final off-campus spot. Neither lost anything in that flood. Mitchell hadn't brought much to college to begin with, Hook said. Last week, Mitchell fit everything he owned into a Honda Accord he'd driven up from Florida. He left his bed and other furniture behind.\n\nThose who know Mitchell can't say which describes him more: that he chose to make the drive to Philadelphia as a first-round pick who could afford to travel any way he'd like -- or that he did so in his old Honda. He favors simpler things and tolerates flair, they say, like the all-black suit he wore on draft day and the subtle jewelry around his neck and wrist.\n\nHe held No. 27 in all four seasons at Toledo. When a reporter asked why he sported No. 30 at rookie minicamp, he shrugged and said, \"They gave me this number.\"\n\nMitchell knows there can be serenity in simplicity. There can be clarity in the repetition of mountains and forests along a Pennsylvania highway, a trance that sweeps the subconscious clean in favor of more important thoughts. Same with football. When other Toledo teammates carefully curated pregame playlists, Mitchell just picked a random song and played it over and over again.\n\n\"That's Q,\" said Corey Parker, Mitchell's position coach at Toledo in 2022 and 2023. \"He's definitely cut from a different cloth. It's the Quinyon Mitchell cloth. He's one of one.\"\n\nMitchell and Hook arrived on campus in January 2020, the same month as Vince Kehres, Toledo's defensive coordinator. Kehres remembers how it was 15 degrees outside when a support staffer picked Mitchell up at the Detroit airport. Mitchell rolled into the facility wearing a pair of shorts and some slides. A new defensive staff began developing a cornerback who was competitive enough to play immediately but still rugged enough to be refined.\n\nOn the first day of workouts, the Toledo staff set up a speed competition drill. Groups were tiered by talent and tenure, Hook figured. He was in the fourth group. He thought it was notable that Mitchell was already in the first. Oh, man, my roommate must be fast. The whistle blew. Mitchell won by 5 yards. Coaches grinned at each other.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" Hook remembered thinking. \"Is that my roommate?\"\n\nMitchell was a freak athlete who developed into a humble star. He hardly showed any emotion after logging four interceptions and two pick-sixes in a blowout win over Northern Illinois in 2022.\n\nParker made it his mission to draw out some intensity in the young cornerback's demeanor. He urged Mitchell to flex a little bit after major plays, to spur energy throughout the stadium. Mitchell erupted during practice and in a game -- until his grandma got a hold of Parker and asked Mitchell to stop showboating.\n\n\"He's not a man of many words,\" Parker said. \"He doesn't speak much. But when he does? Oh, yeah. It's on.\"\n\nMitchell's words carried weight. After Toledo won the MAC championship in 2022, Mitchell earned his first All-America selection and Hook was named first-team All-MAC as a safety, most of the team started getting lured by myriad NIL offers from other schools. Hook remembers being back home when he got a call from Mitchell.\n\n\"I want to do what everybody else is doing,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\"After that, we kind of made our decision right there,\" Hook said. \"It was like, 'Well, if Q's staying, who am I to leave?'\"\n\nPoteat, who left for Wisconsin in 2021, remembers how he showed his new Badgers defensive backs 2020 Toledo film in preparation for a game against Eastern Michigan. His players laughed at a late-game touchdown in which Mitchell had a back-shoulder fade read, had the ball in his hands and had it pulled away from him. Poteat said the Wisconsin defensive back room didn't know how livid it made Mitchell. How much it made him work even harder. When the NFL Draft ticker flashed the name of Philadelphia's No. 22 pick, Poteat said he texted his former players: \"Remember that corner you laughed about?\"\n\nEven on draft day, there were questions about whether Mitchell (the No. 2-ranked cornerback, per The Athletic's Dane Brugler) should've been the first corner off the board. Doubts persisted over whether or not Mitchell could thrive in press-man coverage after playing in Toledo's zone-heavy scheme. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Mitchell dispelled their concerns by locking down top receivers at the Senior Bowl. But Parker says Mitchell didn't alter his preparation for the all-star event, only mastering the techniques he'd already been taught.\n\n\"When you look at his press-man clips, every one is not the same at the Senior Bowl,\" Parker said. \"He chose to use different techniques on different guys by what they're doing, trying to make it the most difficult for them in an offensive drill that's set up for them to win.\"\n\nSo, what did Mitchell learn in Toledo's defense? Kehres and co-defensive coordinator Ross Watson built a base 4-2-5 system that often deployed \"Quarters\" coverage. Yes, that contains zone principles. Toledo believed giving its defensive backs space in off-man alignments helped limit explosive passes.\n\nBut Mitchell's distinct speed and quickness allowed Toledo to play him tighter within the scheme. Kehres says they often placed him on an island in \"catch-man\" techniques in which Mitchell \"caught\" receivers in stride and basically played man coverage thereafter.\n\nKehres argues NFL teams don't make press-man and catch-man coverages their starting point with cornerbacks, since it's difficult to rely on a game plan in which the cornerback heavily covers a receiver with no help from other defensive backs.\n\nStill, that rare skill set is exactly what teams in search of an elite cornerback require. Mitchell indeed had such great speed that if a receiver tried to run by him, he could stay with him. Kehres said he used more catch-man coverages with Mitchell later in his career, which allowed Toledo to play aggressively with their safeties and challenge and rob throws in the middle zones.\n\n\"We played more coverages where he was not going to get help,\" Kehres said. \"There were man concepts and Quarters concepts where we just knew he didn't need it. We could utilize the help in other places.\"\n\nThe Eagles are expected to deploy an array of coverages under defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who's historically used Cover 6 (a blend of Cover 4 and Cover 2) as his base coverage. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said he was \"excited\" to see Mitchell during rookie minicamp, in which Mitchell \"made a couple of nice plays on the ball\" during seven-on-seven drills.\n\n\"You saw the burst and quickness that we saw on tape of why we drafted him in the first round,\" Sirianni said.\n\nSirianni accepted the phone from Roseman in the Eagles' draft room and spoke to his new cornerback for the first time as his head coach.\n\n\"I've been hearing about you for about three years from all my guys over there,\" Sirianni told Mitchell. \"They've been lobbying for that for a long time.\"\n\nFor a player who values a sense of belonging, it's notable how many Eagles connections Mitchell already has. Parker is friends with Brandon Graham's high school coach, who sent Parker a text recently that said, \"B.G. is going to look out for him.\" Darius Slay once visited Parker in Detroit and took a picture with his son. In a video released by the Eagles, Roseman, who values mentorship among players, joked with Mitchell how he wanted the rookie to live next door to Slay.\n\n\"I might move in with him,\" Mitchell responded. \"Real talk. I'm finna text him right now.\"\n\nSirianni was the youngest of three brothers who all went to the University of Mount Union in Alliance, Ohio. Sirianni's middle brother, Jay, shared a house with Kehres, who was the defensive coordinator on a Mount Union staff whose head coach was Larry Kehres, Vince's father. They all recruited Nick, who later joined the staff himself as a defensive backs coach.\n\nNow, at Toledo, there are three former Mount Union coaches: Candle, Kehres and Watson. They all shared the same core values, the same words Mitchell heard at Toledo: Work. Commitment. Loyalty. Hope.\n\nMitchell has already experienced his fair share of all four.\n\nA few weeks ago, Mitchell and Hook went out together to kick back and celebrate the send-off. They recalled their memories and kept saying, \"I can't believe it's over.\" They enjoyed the silence one final time.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

A little more than a year removed from the warm reception, the experienced collegiate athletics administrator views his first full school year at the helm and his new university's trajectory with satisfaction.\n\nThe department's health is most clearly evidenced by its recent additions to the trophy case, he said. Though Mitchell did not claim to be the sole factor in this success, he asserted the gathering of eight Mid-American Conference (MAC) championships since his arrival speaks to where the department is positioned.\n\n\"I'm not suggesting that I take credit for that, but what I am suggesting is that we are in a position of strength, and we're continuing to thrive in a time in intercollegiate athletics where there is a lot of disruption,\" Mitchell said.\n\nThe former deputy director of athletics at Southern Miss brought nearly two decades of experience into his new role, and he quickly applied his outside perspective to reinvigorate Ball State's athletic department.\n\nAesthetic additions to Scheumann Stadium and a lighting project at Worthen Arena headline projects Mitchell and his team spearheaded during year one of his tenure, but some adjustments began even prior to securing the job. Most notably, researching the university ahead of the interview process led him to outline new positions to support the department's overall capacity.\n\n\"I recognized that we had some gaps in how we can better support our student-athletes and our coaches,\" Mitchell said. \"We lacked some depth in certain places, and so I want to work to develop that.\"\n\nHe carried out his preliminary plan by adding six newly created positions to the department's administration staff. Associate athletic director for championship performance, held by former faculty member Lindsey Blom, is an example of one of these roles, and Mitchell said she and the other newly added pieces -- like Mick Tidrow, who manages the department's digital presence in a new full-time capacity -- have enriched his team.\n\n\"[Blom] has been a brilliant hire for us because she understands how all those pieces work together,\" Mitchell said.\n\nMitchell also filled a pair of head coaching vacancies for the softball and women's tennis programs in year one. Helen Pe\u00f1a and Sachin Kirtane, respectively, earned those roles, and he said they each displayed the three qualities that will inform future Ball State coaching hires: expertise, the ability to connect with student-athletes and competitiveness.\n\nIn addition to managing the challenges posed by accepting a new professional role, Mitchell also grappled with adjusting to a new home over the last year. Though he jokingly admitted that previously living in Mississippi and California did not prepare him for Indiana's frigid winters, he said his family has \"really quite enjoyed it here.\"\n\n\"I'm really proud of my wife April, my daughter Harper and my son Carson for being willing to make the move and for being excited about it,\" Mitchell said.\n\nBeing 'comfortable in the unknown' with NIL\n\nOver the last three years, the world of college sports has been changed by the rise of name, image and likeness (NIL). To Mitchell, the idea has become something its creators never intended it to be.\n\n\"Now we have these opportunities for the student-athletes to benefit from their name, image and likeness,\" he said. \"And then the whole system gets twisted on its head because boosters and donors want to use it as more of a recruiting tool.\n\n\"And then these collectives [are established] to pull in all this money and then all of a sudden, name, image and likeness almost goes by the wayside and there's this concept of pay-for-play.\"\n\nWith the sudden change and programs shifting their tactics to find ways to use NIL for items like recruiting, the landscape has changed drastically. This has forced Ball State athletics to look for ways to improve in the category. The Cardinals have their own collective - which donors run - called the 'Feed the Bird Foundation.'\n\nWhile he was openly cautious about NIL and everything that comes with it, the first-year athletic director understood to play the game, you have to be willing to look for those opportunities.\n\n\"I credit Ball State, before my arrival, for at least having the forethought of 'hey, maybe we should get one of these collectives together,\" Mitchell said. \"The 'Feed the Bird Foundation' has certainly been beneficial in that space.\"\n\nYet, Ball State athletics is not solely concerned with the movement. Things like improving facilities and adding new spaces for student-athletes are the program's top priorities.\n\n\"Right now, I've got a certain number of goals, [and] not one of them is NIL-based,\" Mitchell said. \"That could change going into next year, but it just depends on what the landscape looks like.\"\n\nWhen Mitchell fundraises for the program, he understands NIL is something that will come up. He's not shy about it but wants to make sure he gets his point across about other areas in the program.\n\nMitchell's former boss at Santa Clara, Dan Coonan - who is now the commissioner of the ECAC - emphasized the challenges that athletic directors face with fundraising by saying he wanted to give himself a lobotomy after work.\n\n\"I always laughed when he would say that, but I think there's something to be said for controlling what you can,\" Mitchell said. \"I have opinions about it. [Ball State] President [Jeff] Mearns and I discuss it all the time.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we don't necessarily get to dictate policy. So we have to be nimble [and] we have to be flexible as things do change.\"\n\nWhile his focus and viewpoints on NIL may change, there is one thing that will always stay consistent: the treatment of Ball State student-athletes.\n\n\"Whether we have a student for four years or for one season,\" Mitchell said. \"We're going to provide that student-athlete with a quality experience and hope to make a positive impact on his or her life.\"\n\nMitchell is already looking at the future of Ball State athletics\n\nAs Mitchell's first year at the helm of the Cardinals athletic program draws to a close, he has already begun setting the foundation for what the future holds for the department.\n\nWhile still in the early stages, the Eric Foss Championship Performance Center gained approval from Ball State's Board of Trustees on May 3, to begin the nearly $8 million construction project. A project of this magnitude requires much fundraising, and the entirety of the project is being funded through private gifts in which Eric Foss made the initial gift to get the project underway.\n\nThough the process was long, Mitchell picked up where others left off and has turned those dreams into a reality.\n\n\"When I got here, I learned that there had been some preliminary conversations about it,\" Mitchell said. \"So what I wanted to do was pick up where it had been left and start playing with it and seeing if we couldn't make it a reality.\"\n\nFor Mitchell, the goal of the facility is not just to enhance the student-athlete experience, but to make an impression on the athletic department in its entirety. With early projections being for the project to be complete in early 2026, the vision is already there for the impact he hopes it will have on future generations of not just student-athletes, but all Ball State students.\n\nWhile it may be an athletic facility, Mitchell hopes, as a whole, the representation of Ball State is what shines through the most with this project.\n\n\"It is a student-athlete facility, so our student-athletes will benefit from it,\" he said. \"But I do think it will be a vibrant building that will be aesthetically pleasing. That will demonstrate the level of excellence that Ball State University displays towards its students every day.\"\n\nIn addition to the brand new Eric Foss Championship Performance Center, Mitchell also mentioned the potential of talks beginning to circulate about other projects to come down the line with the space freed from the Performance Center such as repurposing the old weight room among other facilities within Worthen Arena.\n\n\"There's some preliminary thoughts of transforming that space into a state-of-the-art sports medicine facility, and we have some locker room desires across our programs as well,\" Mitchell said.\n\nWhether it be large-scale projects or locker room renovations, the gears are churning within the athletic department to ensure its development. Mitchell has seemed to embrace the challenge of leading the athletic department and aims to exert his influence on the department as a whole throughout his tenure.\n\n\"The chance to impact the entirety of a department is very rare,\" Mitchell said. \"When you can impact the entirety of our student-athlete population, that's a very significant opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "ballstatedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ball State Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ball State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Athletic director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College athletics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheumann_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scheumann Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Miss_Golden_Eagles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Miss Golden Eagles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-American_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid-American Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worthen_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worthen Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_College_Athletic_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern College Athletic Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://snworksceo.imgix.net/bsd/36c1d5b7-b970-4ccf-81de-ff096c7a938e.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544809", "eventUri": "eng-9544809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 241, "textEnd": 246}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 6904, "textEnd": 6909}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Data from Britain's Office for National Statistics showed a 21 per cent increase in knife or sharp instrument incidents in the city between 2022 and 2023. Between January 2023 and January 2024, it increased 16 per cent.\n\nThe rise had become a political issue ahead of the upcoming election, much like retail crime such as ram raids became an area of public concern during New Zealand's election as parties recognised law and order was a central issue people would vote on.\n\nIn Australia, the proportion of homicides caused by a knife or other sharp implements has risen to 43 per cent in the five years to 2021, according to Reuters.\n\nJust this month, Sydney suffered two stabbings that attracted global attention. The first led to six people dying in a shopping mall at the hands of a man who was shot dead by police during the incident.\n\nThe second, just days later, allegedly involved a teenage boy stabbing a priest mid-sermon along with several bystanders at a church service. No lives were lost.\n\nThe issue of knife crime was raised in Parliament this week by Labour police spokeswoman Ginny Andersen, who attempted to question Mitchell's ability to reduce levels of crime. She cited police data showing victimisations from incidents using a stabbing or cutting weapon in the Auckland city district had increased by 32 per cent since the coalition Government was formed.\n\nMitchell spoke of the increased number of officers on the street but accepted higher levels of knife crime abroad would \"probably . . . arrive on our shores too\".\n\nAccording to the same police data, there had been a 4.5 per cent increase in victimisations involving a stabbing or cutting weapon in the past five years.\n\n\"Knife crime and weapons have always been an issue for us as a country,\" Mitchell told the Herald.\n\n\"I just want to make sure that that we don't see a sudden increase or surge in terms of what they experience in the UK.\"\n\nTopics traversed during Mitchell's Canberra meeting included Australia's efforts to address family violence and the country's plans to bring in a digital gun register in the next four years.\n\nMitchell said he would be discussing what he learned with Karen Chhour, the Minister for Children and for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence.\n\nOn the gun register, Mitchell said he supported New Zealand's current firearms registry but acknowledged National's commitment with Act to review it. Act had campaigned to scrap the registry.\n\nHis conversations also extended to policies targeting gangs. A bill was currently before select committee that proposed a public gang patch ban as well as giving police new powers to enforce non-consorting and dispersal orders.\n\nThey were modelled on powers available to Western Australia police, which had a specific task force that enforced those laws. Mitchell said he'd spoken with WA Police Minister Paul Papalia and Commissioner Col Blanch and both had expressed their satisfaction with the laws.\n\n\"They've had a huge success. They're very, very happy with them,\" Mitchell said.\n\nWhile enforcement of the Government's proposed powers was being developed by police, Mitchell appeared open to supporting a specific task force in New Zealand and encouraged police to \"do whatever they have to do operationally to implement and make the law effective\".\n\nAnother of the Government's central law and order policies was its commitment with New Zealand First to train 500 more police officers in the first two years.\n\nPolice officials have warned the policy's timeframe was ambitious, given police's struggles with recruitment and attractive offers for officers in Australia.\n\nIn January, Mitchell appeared to have pushed out the timeframe to three years but it was soon confirmed to be two years after an urgent meeting between National and NZ First after the latter learned of Mitchell's comments.\n\nHowever, Mitchell now wasn't forthcoming about details concerning the timeline. When asked when the two years officially began, Mitchell refused to answer and claimed it was Budget-sensitive.\n\nHe did say he was committed to delivering 500 more police in two years.\n\nThat was the same language used by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who said this week he wanted to \"add 500 more frontline police in the two years\".\n\nFinance Minister Nicola Willis couldn't explain why the timeframe outlined to achieve the policy written in a coalition agreement was Budget-sensitive, referring the Herald to Mitchell.\n\nNZ First leader Winston Peters also referred the Herald to Mitchell but when asked whether he expected the policy's timeframe to be honoured, he said: \"How many press statements have you seen out there assuring you of that?\"\n\nAndersen believed recruitment challenges would make the two-year timeframe impossible.\n\n\"Police have told them repeatedly that it's just not possible to deliver on the coalition promise of 500 in two years.\"", "source":

In a sentencing memorandum filed April 26, defense council cited Mitchell's age, character and having no prior record among the reasons for a lighter sentence.\n\nMitchell, who was originally charged with three counts of depriving civil rights, five counts of tampering with a witness, victim, or informant, two counts of influence, and one count of destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure, pleaded guilty on Dec. 7 to two counts of depriving civil rights and one count of tampering with a witness.\n\nThe judge also sentenced Mitchell, who was ordered to pay $300 in restitution, to five years of supervised release for the two counts of depriving civil rights and three years of supervised release for tampering with a witness.\n\nThe charges stem from a lawsuit claiming that Mitchell used unlawful excessive force when he shot Castleberry multiple times, causing her death.\n\nCastleberry died during what was originally described as an undercover prostitution operation. Police said Mitchell was attempting to take Castleberry into custody inside of an unmarked vehicle in the area of Bellows and South Yale Avenue. Police said Castleberry stabbed Mitchell in the hand in the moments leading up to the shooting.\n\nMitchell was accused of kidnapping two women under the guise of arrest for prostitution, and then forcing them to perform sexual acts for their freedom. He was indicted on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter in April 2019. One week later he was indicted on federal charges.\n\nA Franklin County jury cleared Mitchell in April 2023. However, a the federal case awaited him. He pleaded not guilty, and previously rejected a plea deal offered at the end of November before changing his plea to guilty in December.\n\nHours after Mitchell changed his plea, the Columbus Division of Police released a statement about its former officer.\n\n\"Andrew Mitchell betrayed his oath, the values of the Columbus Division of Police and the trust of our community. He used his position to target and exploit some of the most vulnerable in our community. We hope the close of this dark, painful chapter brings some measure of peace to everyone he wronged.\"\n\nFamily of four escapes north Columbus home destroyed in overnight fire\n\nThe former Vice Unit officer went to trial twice in Franklin County Common Pleas Court for the killing of Castleberry, before being found not guilty of murder and voluntary manslaughter. In the initial proceedings in April 2022, the judge declared a mistrial when the jury reported three separate times that it was deadlocked.\n\nMitchell's cases and the 2018 arrest of porn actress Stormy Daniels were among controversies that ultimately led to the Columbus Division of Police abolishing its Vice Unit.

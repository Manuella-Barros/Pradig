Fox now has Daytona 500 and Indy 500", "body": "Fox Sports said Thursday it has acquired the rights to broadcast IndyCar starting in 2025, a move that gives the network two of the biggest races in the world -- the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Daytona 500.\n\nFox Sports already broadcasts the first half of the NASCAR schedule. NASCAR in November announced a seven-year media rights deal that added two new partners and streaming elements as the 38-race schedule is spread over multiple networks and platforms.\n\nTerms of the deal between IndyCar and Fox Sports were not revealed, but Fox promised all 17 races would receive network broadcasts, as well as the two days of qualifying for the Indy 500. That guarantee covers the lifetime of the deal with IndyCar.\n\nIndyCar said NBC Sports could not offer the same amount of national broadcast slots.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nNBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009 and its most recent three-year extension was believed to be worth $20 million per season. But NBC Sports had moved coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions to its app, Peacock, and many of IndyCar's races have been on cable. Earlier this season, NBC moved the crown jewel race at Long Beach to USA Network and received just over 300,000 viewers; the race had 1.026 million viewers in 2023 when it was aired on NBC.\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the past 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion, and best-in-class production,\" NBC said in a statement. \"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's loyal and passionate fans.\"\n\nNBC Sports did not obtain the rights to the entire IndyCar season until 2019. Prior to that, it split the schedule with ABC. The 2023 IndyCar season on NBC Sports was the most watched in IndyCar since 2011, NBC Sports' most-watched season on record, and the most-streamed season ever.\n\nIndyCar's viewership on NBC platforms is flat this season compared to last year, and the Indy 500 drew 5.344 million viewers, up from 4.927 million in 2023.\n\nFox Sports said all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app, while Fox Deportes will carry Spanish-language coverage. Fox also promised coverage of both days of Indy 500 qualifications. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on cable on either FS1 or FS2.\n\nThe 19 events on broadcast is an IndyCar record. IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in the country with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all of its races. NASCAR's schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025 and Fox has said five of its 14 races will be on network, with the rest on cable.\n\nEric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for Fox Sports, touted adding the Indy 500 to the network portfolio. He also said he spoke with NASCAR chairman Jim France on Wednesday to walk him through Fox's new partnership with rival IndyCar.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 ... to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule remains virtually unchanged with the exception that the All-Star race at the Thermal Club in California will now be a points race, and Milwaukee will not be a doubleheader. The season begins March 2 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and concludes Aug. 31 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nTexas Motor Speedway, a longtime stalwart of the IndyCar schedule, will not be used in 2025 for the second consecutive year.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Those 19 broadcast windows on network TV mark a record for IndyCar and make it the only major motorsport in the United States with exclusive network TV coverage for every race.\n\nBy comparison, Fox will show just five of its 14 NASCAR Cup Series races on network TV in 2025.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nIn addition, every IndyCar practice and qualifying session will be shown on cable (either FS1 or FS2); currently, those sessions are available only via streaming on Peacock. And the majority of the second-tier Indy NXT races will air on FS1 as well (with the rest shown on FS2) -- somewhat of a replacement for NASCAR's Xfinity Series, which moves to The CW next year.\n\nFox Sports will now have both major races for America's top two motorsports series: NASCAR's Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500, to which it will give a five-hour window on May 25.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 and delivering the entire NTT IndyCar Series to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Fox Sports CEO and executive producer Eric Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nFox previously filled the Sunday of Memorial Day Weekend with coverage of the Coca-Cola 600, which is one of NASCAR's crown jewel events. But NASCAR took that away as part of its own new media rights deal beginning next year, which reduced Fox's allotment from 18 to 14 races. Prime Video will now show the 600, while Fox can make a splash on the same day with its coverage of the 500 for the first time.\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule was also released Thursday, with little change from this season. The series will open once again in St. Petersburg, Fla., on March 2 and conclude again at Nashville Superspeedway (as it will do this year for the first time) on Aug. 31.\n\nNone of Fox's on-air talent was named in Thursday's announcement.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_gluck@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeff Gluck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-wheel_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open-wheel car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daytona 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Superspeedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Superspeedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/03/07121843/GettyImages-1237227605-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649443", "eventUri": "eng-9649443", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 1484, "textEnd": 1490}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-02", "textStart": 2450, "textEnd": 2457}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-31", "textStart": 2552, "textEnd": 2559}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

NASCAR in November announced a seven-year media rights deal that added two new partners and streaming elements as the 38-race schedule is spread over multiple networks and platforms.\n\nTerms of the deal between IndyCar and Fox Sports were not revealed, but Fox promised all 17 races would receive network broadcasts, as well as the two days of qualifying for the Indy 500. That guarantee covers the lifetime of the deal with IndyCar.\n\nIndyCar said NBC Sports could not offer the same amount of national broadcast slots.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nDavich: Another fatality at the blindside intersection of wrong place, wrong time Plug pulled on $1.3 billion Chesterton data center proposal in face of opposition New stores opening at Southlake Mall in Hobart Passenger airlifted Friday after vehicle pulled in front of her on U.S. 20, Porter County police say 2 injured Monday when South Shore train hits truck, official says East Coast chain Wawa breaks ground on first Indiana store, eyes 60 locations Family of Crown Point ironworker sues after 100-floot plunge at University of Chicago Hospital, faced with 'life-altering, catastrophic injuries' Longtime athletic director, football and basketball coach died 2 Region shooting deaths ruled homicides 'Nurse' claiming to find fire at patient's Porter County home charged with arson, cops say 219 News Now: Valparaiso Neighborhoods Under Boil Water Advisory After Water Main Break Man charged with repeatedly molesting family member, records show NWI Business Ins and Outs: Restaurant with tree inside, Brody's Candy Corner & Sundae Shop, Helen's Cafe and Cielito Lindo open; Mescolare closed and Geppetto's closing NWI Business Ins and Outs: Butterfingers, French restaurant, oyster bar, Azucar Ice Cream and Parlor Doughnuts opening; Steak and Shake and Zel's Roast Beef closed Motorcyclist critically injured while racing to beat train, cops say\n\nNBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009 and its most recent three-year extension was believed to be worth $20 million per season. But NBC Sports had moved coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions to its app, Peacock, and many of IndyCar's races have been on cable. Earlier this season, NBC moved the crown jewel race at Long Beach to USA Network and received just over 300,000 viewers; the race had 1.026 million viewers in 2023 when it was aired on NBC.\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the past 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion, and best-in-class production,\" NBC said in a statement. \"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's loyal and passionate fans.\"\n\nNBC Sports did not obtain the rights to the entire IndyCar season until 2019. Prior to that, it split the schedule with ABC. The 2023 IndyCar season on NBC Sports was the most watched in IndyCar since 2011, NBC Sports' most-watched season on record, and the most-streamed season ever.\n\nIndyCar's viewership on NBC platforms is flat this season compared to last year, and the Indy 500 drew 5.344 million viewers, up from 4.927 million in 2023.\n\nFox Sports said all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app, while Fox Deportes will carry Spanish-language coverage. Fox also promised coverage of both days of Indy 500 qualifications. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on cable on either FS1 or FS2.\n\nThe 19 events on broadcast is an IndyCar record. IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in the country with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all of its races. NASCAR's schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025 and Fox has said five of its 14 races will be on network, with the rest on cable.\n\nEric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for Fox Sports, touted adding the Indy 500 to the network portfolio. He also said he spoke with NASCAR chairman Jim France on Wednesday to walk him through Fox's new partnership with rival IndyCar.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 ... to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule remains virtually unchanged with the exception that the All-Star race at the Thermal Club in California will now be a points race, and Milwaukee will not be a doubleheader. The season begins March 2 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and concludes Aug. 31 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nTexas Motor Speedway, a longtime stalwart of the IndyCar schedule, will not be used in 2025 for the second consecutive year.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

NASCAR in November announced a seven-year media rights deal that added two new partners and streaming elements as the 38-race schedule is spread over multiple networks and platforms.\n\nTerms of the deal between IndyCar and FOX Sports were not revealed, but FOX promised all 17 races would receive network broadcasts, as well as the two days of qualifying for the Indy 500. That guarantee covers the lifetime of the deal with IndyCar.\n\nIndyCar said NBC Sports could not offer the same amount of national broadcast slots.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"FOX Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nNBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009 and its most recent three-year extension was believed to be worth $20 million per season. But NBC Sports had moved coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions to its app, Peacock, and many of IndyCar's races have been on cable. Earlier this season, NBC moved the crown jewel race at Long Beach to USA Network and received just over 300,000 viewers; the race had 1.026 million viewers in 2023 when it was aired on NBC.\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the past 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion, and best-in-class production,\" NBC said in a statement. \"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's loyal and passionate fans.\"\n\nNBC Sports did not obtain the rights to the entire IndyCar season until 2019. Prior to that, it split the schedule with ABC. The 2023 IndyCar season on NBC Sports was the most watched in IndyCar since 2011, NBC Sports' most-watched season on record, and the most-streamed season ever.\n\nIndyCar's viewership on NBC platforms is flat this season compared to last year, and the Indy 500 drew 5.344 million viewers, up from 4.927 million in 2023.\n\nFOX Sports said all races will be on FOX and the FOX Sports app, while FOX Deportes will carry Spanish-language coverage. FOX also promised coverage of both days of Indy 500 qualifications. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on cable on either FS1 or FS2.\n\nThe 19 events on broadcast is an IndyCar record. IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in the country with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all of its races. NASCAR's schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025 and FOX has said five of its 14 races will be on network, with the rest on cable.\n\nEric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for FOX Sports, touted adding the Indy 500 to the network portfolio. He also said he spoke with NASCAR chairman Jim France on Wednesday to walk him through FOX's new partnership with rival IndyCar.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 ... to the FOX Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at FOX Sports.\"\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule remains virtually unchanged with the exception that the All-Star race at the Thermal Club in California will now be a points race, and Milwaukee will not be a doubleheader. The season begins March 2 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and concludes Aug. 31 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nTexas Motor Speedway, a longtime stalwart of the IndyCar schedule, will not be used in 2025 for the second consecutive year.", "source": {"uri": "fox11online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenna_fryer@fox11online.com", "name": "Jenna Fryer", "type": "author",

NBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009 and its most recent three-year extension was believed to be worth $20 million per season.\n\nBut NBC Sports had moved coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions to its app, Peacock, and many of IndyCar's races have been on cable. Earlier this season, NBC moved the crown jewel race at Long Beach to the USA Network and received just over 300,000 viewers; the race had 1.026 million viewers in 2023 when it was aired on NBC.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nDeere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants Hy-Vee holds event at closing Logan Avenue store, customers still upset Proposed Cedar Falls housing development has neighbors concerned 3 Iowa U.S. House members seek $115M in earmarks UPDATE: Deere posts notice of 123 layoffs, 49 in Waterloo; global production, salaried employees cut 2024 U.S. Open long shot picks: Odds and dark horse picks for U.S. Open golf at Pinehurst College Men's Basketball: Highly-touted forward commits to UNI in class of 2025 Child injured in Cedar Falls accident My Waterloo Days brings diverse community together in one block 'The Vibe' takes over Scoopski's location, still offering ice cream One arrested in overnight Waterloo shooting that sent man to hospital Two injured in three shootings Names released in fatal motorcycle crash Waterloo native takes reins at Oklahoma City school district MLB Baseball: Chicago Cubs sign Cedar Falls native, former Iowa Hawkeye to minor league deal\n\nFox Sports said all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app, while Fox Deportes will carry exclusive Spanish-language coverage. Fox also promised coverage of both days of Indy 500 qualifications. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on cable on either FS1 or FS2.\n\nThe 19 events aired on the broadcast is an IndyCar record. IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in the country with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all of its races. NASCAR's schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nEric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for Fox Sports, touted adding the Indy 500 to the network portfolio.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 ... to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule remains virtually unchanged with the exception that the All-Star race at the Thermal Club in California will now be a points race, and Milwaukee will not be a doubleheader. The season begins March 2 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and concludes Aug. 31 in Nashville.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first

Discovery Broaden Sports Offer 2 days ago\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 is racing to Fox after circling the track many years at NBC\n\nIndyCar announced Thursday that Fox would become the new home of the NTT IndyCar Series and the iconic race starting in 2025. The new pact means Fox will have rights to two of auto-racing's best known events -- the Indianapolis 500 and the Daytona 500, part of NASCAR.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 and delivering the entire NTT IndyCar Series to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" said Eric Shanks, CEO of Fox Sports and its executive producer. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 has been at NBC since 2019, when NBC won the rights that had long been held by Disney and ABC.\n\nBut NBC has new reasons to count its sports budgets more carefully. The company is believed to have an agreement in place to take over a significant number of NBA games that have been under the aegis of Warner Bros. Discovery -- a deal that is expected to be costly. NBC recently ceded rights to the French Open, which will move to Warner starting next year.\n\nUnder terms of the new IndyCar pact, Fox will air every 2025 NTT race on its broadcast network and the Fox Sports app, as well as on Fox Deportes. Fox will also provide coverage of Indy 500 qualifications on both Saturday and Sunday, bringing the total number of broadcast network windows to 19, an expanded total for NTT. IndyCar will become the only premier motorsport in the United States with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all its races.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox ports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Fox will set aside a five-hour window on the broadcast network for Indianapolis 500 coverage. .\n\nAll practice and qualifying sessions for the NTT IndyCar Series will be telecast on cable on FS1 and FS2.

The majority of INDY NXT by Firestone races will also air on FS1, with FS2 providing supplemental coverage of additional races.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of continued growth and momentum for IndyCar, which has seen rising attendance across its schedule, significant growth in commercial partnerships and record metrics across its digital platforms.\n\nAdditional announcements, including on-air talent, will be announced at a later date.\n\nMay 10 -

NBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009 and its most recent three-year extension was believed to be worth $20 million per season.\n\nBut NBC Sports had moved coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions to its app, Peacock, and many of IndyCar's races have been on cable. Earlier this season, NBC moved the crown jewel race at Long Beach to the USA Network and received just over 300,000 viewers; the race had 1.026 million viewers in 2023 when it was aired on NBC.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Fox also promised coverage of both days of Indy 500 qualifications. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on cable on either FS1 or FS2.\n\nThe 19 events aired on the broadcast is an IndyCar record. IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in the country with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all of its races. NASCAR's schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nEric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for Fox Sports, touted adding the Indy 500 to the network portfolio.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 ... to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule remains virtually unchanged with the exception that the All-Star race at the Thermal Club in California will now be a points race, and Milwaukee will not be a doubleheader. The season begins March 2 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and concludes Aug. 31 in Nashville.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

NBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009 and its most recent three-year extension was believed to be worth $20 million per season.\n\nBut NBC Sports had moved coverage of all practices and qualifying sessions to its app, Peacock, and many of IndyCar's races have been on cable. Earlier this season, NBC moved the crown jewel race at Long Beach to the USA Network and received just over 300,000 viewers; the race had 1.026 million viewers in 2023 when it was aired on NBC.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He's 100, she's 96 Napa County gives raise to its employees\n\nFox Sports said all races will be on Fox and the Fox Sports app, while Fox Deportes will carry exclusive Spanish-language coverage. Fox also promised coverage of both days of Indy 500 qualifications. All practice and qualifying sessions will be aired on cable on either FS1 or FS2.\n\nThe 19 events aired on the broadcast is an IndyCar record. IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in the country with exclusive major broadcast network coverage for all of its races. NASCAR's schedule, for example, is spread across multiple networks in 2025.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nEric Shanks, the CEO and executive producer for Fox Sports, touted adding the Indy 500 to the network portfolio.\n\n\"Adding the iconic Indianapolis 500 ... to the Fox Sports roster fits perfectly within our model of teaming with sports' largest events and best-in-class brands,\" Shanks said. \"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nThe 2025 IndyCar schedule remains virtually unchanged with the exception that the All-Star race at the Thermal Club in California will now be a points race, and Milwaukee will not be a doubleheader. The season begins March 2 in St. Petersburg, Florida, and concludes Aug. 31 in Nashville.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

NBC said it was their most-watched Sunday sports event since the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played the Detroit Lions in the NFL playoffs on Jan. 21.\n\nDespite the robust television and streaming audience on NBC, IndyCar will be leaving for a new home for the first time since its split-network deal with ABC and NBC ended in 2018.\n\nReports SBJ's Adam Stern:\n\nWhile exact terms of the agreement that was being finalized between Fox and IndyCar were unclear as of this report, the series was believed in recent months to still be looking to have one full-season partner for its next cycle. Such a move would thus end IndyCar's relationship with NBC after this season, which wraps up in mid-September.\n\nNBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009, either alone or in tandem. According to the AP, IndyCar's most recent three-year extension with NBC was believed to be worth $20 million per season.\n\nSBJ reported that Fox will no longer air NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend because of the way NASCAR's new media rights deals are structured.

best-in-class brands.\"\n\n\"We're honored to be the new broadcast home to 'The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' an incredibly special event to everyone at Fox Sports.\"\n\nAlong with race day coverage, Fox will also broadcast practice and qualifying sessions on FS1 and FS1.\n\nFurthermore, most Indy NXT by Firestone series races will also be broadcast on FS1.\n\nFS2 will broadcast \"supplemental coverage of additional races.\"\n\nWho will comprise of Fox's on-air talent when covering the series has yet to be announced.\n\nThe Series' first race on Fox will be held on March 2 2025 in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Thermal Club will be next up on March 23, followed by the Streets of Long Beach on April 13, Barber Motorsports Park on May 4, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Road Course on May 10.\n\nThe 109th Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge will be held on May 25, before they head for Detroit on June 1.\n\nWorld Wide Technology Raceway will host the next race on June 15, before they take on Road America on June 22.\n\nJuly will be kickstarted at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course on the 6th, followed by a doubleheader at Iowa Speedway on July 12 and 13.\n\nToronto's street circuit will host the Series on July 20, after which they'll head for WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca on July 27.\n\nThe season will conclude with three races in August, starting with the Portland International Raceway on the 10th, the Milwaukee Mile on the 24th, and the Nashville Superspeedway on the 31st.\n\nThis move to Fox will bring to an end IndyCar's 15-year partnership with NBC Sports.\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the last 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion and best-in-class production,\" an NBC spokesperson said in a statement, via IndyStar.\n\n\"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's

It found that with Fox.", "body": "IndyCar, FOX agree to media rights deal, putting all 19 races on network TV\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- After an extensive search and negotiating period that lasted well over six months, Penske Entertainment officials have landed Fox as IndyCar's new exclusive media rights partner, the series announced Thursday. The new multi-year deal that starts in 2025 with the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Pete (March 2, 2025) ends a six-year exclusive relationship with NBCUniversal and Comcast and a longer-standing one that began with Versus in 2009.\n\nDating back to a preseason media availability in February, Penske Entertainment president and CEO Mark Miles has long promised IndyCar would prioritize reach above all else in its next TV deal.\n\nMiles and series owner Roger Penske couldn't have done any better, having placed all 17 races on network TV in 2025, along with an additional network TV window during both days of Indianapolis 500 qualifying for a total of 19.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" Miles said in a release. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nDuring the first two years of IndyCar's current deal with NBC, it landed 15 total network windows -- 14 races and one day of 500 qualifying in 2022 and 13 races and both 500 qualifying days in 2023. This year, that number scaled back to 12 -- including Sunday Indy 500 qualifying and the exhibition event at The Thermal Club.\n\nAccording to a source, though NBC offered a significant number of network TV windows, it had been unwilling to guarantee placing all 17 races on network television. With the understanding that Fox officials also offered an uplift in its rights fees, it made the newcomer's package impossible to turn down for a sport very much in need of continued fan base growth.\n\nFox streaming element still a work-in-progress\n\nIn recent years, cord-cutting IndyCar fans had been able to subscribe to NBC's Peacock streaming service and watch all races live, and the platform also offered the only way to watch all practice and qualifying sessions.\n\nIn its new deal with Fox, all practice and qualifying will air on a combination of its sports-specific cable offerings, FS1 and FS2. Presently, Fox only offers the ability to watch live sports on its Fox Sports app for those who can authenticate their subscription to another cable or TV-watching package that includes Fox. As soon as this year, though, Fox Sports' offerings will be available through the network's partnership with ESPN and Warner Bros Discovery's unique sports-only streaming platform named 'Venu Sports.'\n\nThere, subscribers will be able to watch live the three companies' full catalog of sports, from racing (Formula 1, NASCAR and IndyCar), to portions of the NFL season, MLB, large chunks of college basketball and football, the NBA and more.\n\nAs part of this current Fox deal, the network will air races of IndyCar's feeder series, Indy NXT, on a combination of FS1 and FS2 -- with the bulk of those races landing on FS1, according to a Penske Entertainment official.\n\nFox IndyCar broadcast crew undecided\n\nIndyCar and Fox did not announce its talent crew as part of Thursday's news. The major difference in next year's IndyCar broadcast booth will be the loss of longtime play-by-play anchor Leigh Diffey, who will remain with NBC in a multi-faceted role. Though not formally announced yet by NBC, many expect Diffey not to return to the IndyCar booth following the series' multi-week break for the Summer Olympics between Toronto (July 21) and World Wide Technology Raceway (Aug. 17). Following the Olympics, Diffey many sources in the IndyCar paddock to join NBC's NASCAR booth, though it's unclear if that decision has been formally and whether it's set in stone or merely a strong likelihood.\n\nDiffey is also set to miss the upcoming weekend at Laguna Seca, due to his role covering the U.S. Track and Field trials, and he's also said to be missing the Toronto street race as he heads off to Paris -- making potentially his last time in an IndyCar race weekend booth the Iowa Speedway doubleheader (July 13-14). In his place, as they've done before, NBC is likely to lean on pit lane regular Kevin Lee to fill-in for Diffey.\n\nSeries sources expect longtime Fox motorsports personalities Adam Alexander or Jamie Little, ex-IndyCar voice Allen Bestwick or Lee to be in the running to fill Fox's play-by-play role. One of -- but possibly not both -- of current color commentators James Hinchcliffe and Townsend Bell are thought likely to be signed to join the booth as well.\n\nNBC 'proud' of growth it delivered IndyCar\n\nIn a statement regarding the impending end to the pair's partnership, an NBC spokesperson offered this statement:\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the last 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion and best-in-class production,\" the statement read. \"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's loyal and passionate fans.\"\n\nIndyCar likely landed higher payday; specifics unclear\n\nThough it has been long-expected part of the attraction of Fox would be a larger payday for Penske Entertainment -- an increase from its annual rights fees with NBC that fell in the $20 million to $25 million range -- it's unclear what this latest deal entails from a financial standpoint. Series officials declined to elaborate on the specifics of the deal.\n\nAn important piece to the puzzle -- one we may learn more about later Thursday -- is the level of involvement for IMS Productions in this deal moving forward. Under the current deal, NBC largely staffs its production truck at races, while IMSP workers largely set-up and man cameras during race weekends, while also providing the physical cameras, trucks and other production equipment.\n\nTo help ease many fans' initial negative reactions to IndyCar landing on Fox -- which has drawn the ire of loads of NASCAR fans for its production quality of the stock car series of late -- IMSP could take on an even larger role in the production lead on race weekends to help steady fans' worry, though that's presently unclear. An increased role for IMSP could also be reason for Fox to offer more cash, given they'd have to provide fewer resources on the back-end to help run the show.\n\nLength of latest IndyCar deal with Fox unclear\n\nWhen asked the length of this new deal with Fox, Penske Entertainment officials declined to comment, though IndyCar's recent deals have been three years in length.\n\nFollow IndyStar motor sports Insider Nathan Brown on X at @By_NathanBrown.\n\n2025 IndyCar race schedule on Fox", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tennessean"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Diffey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leigh Diffey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCSN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

With Comcast, some races were televised by NBC and some on the USA cable network.\n\nThe largest IndyCar event, the Indianapolis 500, will have a five-hour window on Fox, according to the announcement.\n\nFox \"is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms,\" series CEO Mark Miles said in the statement.\n\nFox televises the first half of the NASCAR season, with races split between broadcast and cable. Fox broadcasts NASCAR's biggest event, the Daytona 500. NBC has the second half of the schedule, also splitting races between broadcast and cable.\n\nPenske, who built up transportation businesses including auto dealerships, acquired IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2019. He also operates one of the main teams in the series.\n\nPenske's team got caught in a cheating scandal in April, involving illegal use of so-called \"push to pass\" software. Driver Josef Newgarden was stripped of his win for the first 2024 IndyCar race in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nGoing into May, it was a difficult time for Penske. But the month ended on a high note when Newgarden won this year's Indy 500, giving Penske his 20 Indy win as an owner.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytona 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/666b2889df002717b6bf7141/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649443", "eventUri": "eng-9649443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It found that with FOX.", "body": "IndyCar, FOX agree to media rights deal, putting all 19 races on network TV\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- After an extensive search and negotiating period that lasted well over six months, Penske Entertainment officials have landed FOX as IndyCar's new exclusive media rights partner, the series announced Thursday. The new multi-year deal that starts in 2025 with the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Pete (March 2, 2025) ends a six-year exclusive relationship with NBCUniversal and Comcast and a longer-standing one that began with Versus in 2009.\n\nDating back to a preseason media availability in February, Penske Entertainment president and CEO Mark Miles has long promised IndyCar would prioritize reach above all else in its next TV deal.\n\nMiles and series owner Roger Penske couldn't have done any better, having placed all 17 races on network TV in 2025, along with an additional network TV window during both days of Indianapolis 500 qualifying for a total of 19.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" Miles said in a release. \"FOX Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nDuring the first two years of IndyCar's current deal with NBC, it landed 15 total network windows -- 14 races and one day of 500 qualifying in 2022 and 13 races and both 500 qualifying days in 2023. This year, that number scaled back to 12 -- including Sunday Indy 500 qualifying and the exhibition event at The Thermal Club.\n\nAccording to a source, though NBC offered a significant number of network TV windows, it had been unwilling to guarantee placing all 17 races on network television. With the understanding that FOX officials also offered an uplift in its rights fees, it made the newcomer's package impossible to turn down for a sport very much in need of continued fan base growth.\n\nFOX streaming element still a work-in-progress\n\nIn recent years, cord-cutting IndyCar fans had been able to subscribe to NBC's Peacock streaming service and watch all races live, and the platform also offered the only way to watch all practice and qualifying sessions.\n\nIn its new deal with FOX, all practice and qualifying will air on a combination of its sports-specific cable offerings, FS1 and FS2. Presently, FOX only offers the ability to watch live sports on its FOX Sports app for those who can authenticate their subscription to another cable or TV-watching package that includes FOX. As soon as this year, though, FOX Sports' offerings will be available through the network's partnership with ESPN and Warner Bros Discovery's unique sports-only streaming platform named 'Venu Sports.'\n\nThere, subscribers will be able to watch live the three companies' full catalog of sports, from racing (Formula 1, NASCAR and IndyCar), to portions of the NFL season, MLB, large chunks of college basketball and football, the NBA and more.\n\nAs part of this current FOX deal, the network will air races of IndyCar's feeder series, Indy NXT, on a combination of FS1 and FS2 -- with the bulk of those races landing on FS1, according to a Penske Entertainment official.\n\nFOX IndyCar broadcast crew undecided\n\nIndyCar and FOX did not announce its talent crew as part of Thursday's news. The major difference in next year's IndyCar broadcast booth will be the loss of longtime play-by-play anchor Leigh Diffey, who will remain with NBC in a multi-faceted role. Though not formally announced yet by NBC, many expect Diffey not to return to the IndyCar booth following the series' multi-week break for the Summer Olympics between Toronto (July 21) and World Wide Technology Raceway (Aug. 17). Following the Olympics, Diffey many sources in the IndyCar paddock to join NBC's NASCAR booth, though it's unclear if that decision has been formally and whether it's set in stone or merely a strong likelihood.\n\nDiffey is also set to miss the upcoming weekend at Laguna Seca, due to his role covering the U.S. Track and Field trials, and he's also said to be missing the Toronto street race as he heads off to Paris -- making potentially his last time in an IndyCar race weekend booth the Iowa Speedway doubleheader (July 13-14). In his place, as they've done before, NBC is likely to lean on pit lane regular Kevin Lee to fill-in for Diffey.\n\nSeries sources expect longtime FOX motorsports personalities Adam Alexander or Jamie Little, ex-IndyCar voice Allen Bestwick or Lee to be in the running to fill FOX's play-by-play role. One of -- but possibly not both -- of current color commentators James Hinchcliffe and Townsend Bell are thought likely to be signed to join the booth as well.\n\nNBC 'proud' of growth it delivered IndyCar\n\nIn a statement regarding the impending end to the pair's partnership, an NBC spokesperson offered this statement:\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the last 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion and best-in-class production,\" the statement read. \"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's loyal and passionate fans.\"\n\nIndyCar likely landed higher payday; specifics unclear\n\nThough it has been long-expected part of the attraction of FOX would be a larger payday for Penske Entertainment -- an increase from its annual rights fees with NBC that fell in the $20 million to $25 million range -- it's unclear what this latest deal entails from a financial standpoint. Series officials declined to elaborate on the specifics of the deal.\n\nAn important piece to the puzzle -- one we may learn more about later Thursday -- is the level of involvement for IMS Productions in this deal moving forward. Under the current deal, NBC largely staffs its production truck at races, while IMSP workers largely set-up and man cameras during race weekends, while also providing the physical cameras, trucks and other production equipment.\n\nTo help ease many fans' initial negative reactions to IndyCar landing on FOX -- which has drawn the ire of loads of NASCAR fans for its production quality of the stock car series of late -- IMSP could take on an even larger role in the production lead on race weekends to help steady fans' worry, though that's presently unclear. An increased role for IMSP could also be reason for FOX to offer more cash, given they'd have to provide fewer resources on the back-end to help run the show.\n\nLength of latest IndyCar deal with FOX unclear\n\nWhen asked the length of this new deal with FOX, Penske Entertainment officials declined to comment, though IndyCar's recent deals have been three years in length.\n\nFollow IndyStar motor sports Insider Nathan Brown on X at @By_NathanBrown.\n\n2025 IndyCar race schedule on FOX", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Diffey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leigh Diffey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCSN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

That includes the Indianapolis 500, which has been telecast by NBC for the last 16 years.\n\nThe 17 races roll over 16 weekends (there is a doubleheader weekend at Iowa) and with both Indy 500 qualifying days on FOX, that makes 19 windows on network television for the open-wheel racing series.\n\nIndyCar CEO Miles said the ability to have the entire season on network made the difference to move from NBC (which currently splits the IndyCar package among NBC, USA and Peacock) to FOX.\n\n[Related: Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden 1-on-1: 'The final pass was like hold your breath']\n\n\"Strategically, ... 19 windows is compelling,\" Miles said. \"For us to cut that in a third or in half, it just doesn't make any sense. We love that fans will know where to go. We love that there's a great deal of consistency. And we think this maximizes the audience.\n\n\"I don't know if I'd think about it differently if we had two or three times the number of races. But for what we have, as the IndyCar Series, to us to have one powerful, committed partner will maximize our fan base and our audience.\"\n\nThe races also would be available to those who can stream on the FOX Sports App.\n\n\"One of our mantras at FOX Sports is simple wins,\" FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks said. \"And it's just a fact that the biggest events and the broadest audiences are on broadcast television. FOX is distributed not only over the air but also on every streaming platform that's out there.\n\n\"So we're reaching audiences no matter demographic, no matter age.\"\n\nFOX Sports also has the first 14 events (12 points races, the Clash and the all-star race) of the NASCAR schedule, which will have five races on FOX and nine on FS1. The remaining 24 Cup events will be split among four other broadcasters (Amazon Prime Video has five races, TNT has five races, NBC has four races and USA has 10). Shanks said he spoke Wednesday to NASCAR Chairman Jim France about the IndyCar deal.\n\n\"There's going to be a great halo effect for all motorsports,\" Shanks said. \"Once you start to put the two schedules together -- both Indy and NASCAR -- there's going to be a great halo effect of motorsports because a lot of times they're going to be leading in and out of each other.\n\n\"And so the FOX network is not going to be starting from scratch. When we do NASCAR races, you're already going to have a motorsports audience for some of the lead-ins to NASCAR races. And I think that circulation and promotion is going to fit both series. Definitely.\"\n\nAs far as the exact lead-ins, start times for the 2025 IndyCar Series races were not announced and NASCAR has not announced its 2025 schedule. It should release its Cup schedule by the end of the month.\n\n\"Recently we announced that we're going to put sports on Friday nights on the broadcast network, so that allowed us to move some UFL football games off the network from the weekend on to Friday night, so you'll see UFL on Friday night, which freed up some windows as well,\" Shanks said.\n\n\"There was a lot of moving pieces to make this a reality. Strategically, we'll continue to work with Indy on start times and windows to maximize the potential audience.\"\n\nAmong other details of the announcement:\n\n--The length of the deal was not announced. It is a multiyear deal. Miles would not comment on whether IndyCar got an increase from its previous NBC deal.\n\n--The windows on FOX for the races will be 2.5 hours, except the Indianapolis 500 will have a 5-hour window.\n\n--The blackout of the Indy 500 telecast in the Indianapolis area remains in effect.\n\n--Practice and qualifying for all races will be on FS1 or FS2 (Indianapolis 500 qualifying will be on FOX). The INDY NXT development series will air on FS1 or FS2, with the majority of races on FS1.\n\nThis is the second television package negotiated by IndyCar since Roger Penske purchased the series following the 2019 season.\n\n\"I feel like this has been kind of a long time coming -- IndyCar and the Indianapolis 500 is truly a crown jewel in not only motorsports but also sports in general,\" Shanks said. \"It truly captures the nation's attention. And as you guys have seen, under the leadership, ownership of the Penskes, there's just incredible momentum if you're ever around Indianapolis in May.\"\n\nBob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

It found that with Fox.", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS -- After an extensive search and negotiating period that lasted well over six months, Penske Entertainment officials have landed Fox as IndyCar's new exclusive media rights partner, the series announced Thursday. The new multi-year deal that starts in 2025 with the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Pete (March 2, 2025) ends a six-year exclusive relationship with NBCUniversal and Comcast and a longer-standing one that began with Versus in 2009.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nDating back to a preseason media availability in February, Penske Entertainment president and CEO Mark Miles has long promised IndyCar would prioritize reach above all else in its next TV deal.\n\nMiles and series owner Roger Penske couldn't have done any better, having placed all 17 races on network TV in 2025, along with an additional network TV window during both days of Indianapolis 500 qualifying for a total of 19.\n\n\"This represents unrivaled exposure and provides an unparalleled growth opportunity for the most competitive and entertaining motorsport on the planet,\" Miles said in a release. \"Fox Sports is a fully committed partner, ready to bring engaging and technically innovative coverage to millions of fans across the country while also promoting IndyCar thoroughly across all its platforms.\"\n\nDuring the first two years of IndyCar's current deal with NBC, it landed 15 total network windows -- 14 races and one day of 500 qualifying in 2022 and 13 races and both 500 qualifying days in 2023. This year, that number scaled back to 12 -- including Sunday Indy 500 qualifying and the exhibition event at The Thermal Club.\n\nAccording to a source, though NBC offered a significant number of network TV windows, it had been unwilling to guarantee placing all 17 races on network television. With the understanding that Fox officials also offered an uplift in its rights fees, it made the newcomer's package impossible to turn down for a sport very much in need of continued fan base growth.\n\nIn recent years, cord-cutting IndyCar fans had been able to subscribe to NBC's Peacock streaming service and watch all races live, and the platform also offered the only way to watch all practice and qualifying sessions.\n\nIn its new deal with Fox, all practice and qualifying will air on a combination of its sports-specific cable offerings, FS1 and FS2. Presently, Fox only offers the ability to watch live sports on its Fox Sports app for those who can authenticate their subscription to another cable or TV-watching package that includes Fox. As soon as this year, though, Fox Sports' offerings will be available through the network's partnership with ESPN and Warner Bros Discovery's unique sports-only streaming platform named 'Venu Sports.'\n\nThere, subscribers will be able to watch live the three companies' full catalog of sports, from racing (Formula 1, NASCAR and IndyCar), to portions of the NFL season, MLB, large chunks of college basketball and football, the NBA and more.\n\nVenu Sports is set to launch later this year.\n\nAs part of this current Fox deal, the network will air races of IndyCar's feeder series, Indy NXT, on a combination of FS1 and FS2 -- with the bulk of those races landing on FS1, according to a Penske Entertainment official.\n\nIndyCar and Fox did not announce its talent crew as part of Thursday's news. The major difference in next year's IndyCar broadcast booth will be the loss of longtime play-by-play anchor Leigh Diffey, who will remain with NBC in a multi-faceted role. Though not formally announced yet by NBC, many expect Diffey not to return to the IndyCar booth following the series' multi-week break for the Summer Olympics between Toronto (July 21) and World Wide Technology Raceway (Aug. 17). Following the Olympics, Diffey many sources in the IndyCar paddock to join NBC's NASCAR booth, though it's unclear if that decision has been formally and whether it's set in stone or merely a strong likelihood.\n\nDiffey is also set to miss the upcoming weekend at Laguna Seca, due to his role covering the U.S. Track and Field trials, and he's also said to be missing the Toronto street race as he heads off to Paris -- making potentially his last time in an IndyCar race weekend booth the Iowa Speedway doubleheader (July 13-14). In his place, as they've done before, NBC is likely to lean on pit lane regular Kevin Lee to fill-in for Diffey.\n\nSeries sources expect longtime Fox motorsports personalities Adam Alexander or Jamie Little, ex-IndyCar voice Allen Bestwick or Lee to be in the running to fill Fox's play-by-play role. One of -- but possibly not both -- of current color commentators James Hinchcliffe and Townsend Bell are thought likely to be signed to join the booth as well.\n\nIn a statement regarding the impending end to the pair's partnership, an NBC spokesperson offered this statement:\n\n\"We are very proud of our contributions to the growth of IndyCar over the last 16 seasons, generating record viewership, unprecedented promotion and best-in-class production,\" the statement read. \"We want to thank the drivers, teams and owners for their partnership, and we look forward to presenting the rest of the 2024 season to IndyCar's loyal and passionate fans.\"\n\nThough it has been long-expected part of the attraction of Fox would be a larger payday for Penske Entertainment -- an increase from its annual rights fees with NBC that fell in the $20 million to $25 million range -- it's unclear what this latest deal entails from a financial standpoint. Series officials declined to elaborate on the specifics of the deal.\n\nAn important piece to the puzzle -- one we may learn more about later Thursday -- is the level of involvement for IMS Productions in this deal moving forward. Under the current deal, NBC largely staffs its production truck at races, while IMSP workers largely set-up and man cameras during race weekends, while also providing the physical cameras, trucks and other production equipment.\n\nTo help ease many fans' initial negative reactions to IndyCar landing on Fox -- which has drawn the ire of loads of NASCAR fans for its production quality of the stock car series of late -- IMSP could take on an even larger role in the production lead on race weekends to help steady fans' worry, though that's presently unclear. An increased role for IMSP could also be reason for Fox to offer more cash, given they'd have to provide fewer resources on the back-end to help run the show.\n\nWhen asked the length of this new deal with Fox, Penske Entertainment officials declined to comment, though IndyCar's recent deals have been three years in length.\n\nFollow IndyStar motor sports Insider Nathan Brown on X at @By_NathanBrown.\n\nThis is the 2025 IndyCar schedule with day of week, date, location, course type and TV:", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Diffey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leigh Diffey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCSN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

We love that fans will know where to go. We love that there's a great deal of consistency. And we think this maximizes the audience.\n\n\"I don't know if I'd think about it differently if we had two or three times the number of races. But for what we have, as the IndyCar Series, to us to have one powerful, committed partner will maximize our fan base and our audience.\"\n\nThe races also would be available to those who can stream on the FOX Sports App.\n\n\"One of our mantras at FOX Sports is simple wins,\" FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks said. \"And it's just a fact that the biggest events and the broadest audiences are on broadcast television. FOX is distributed not only over the air but also on every streaming platform that's out there.\n\n\"So we're reaching audiences no matter demographic, no matter age.\"\n\nFOX Sports also has the first 14 events (12 points races, the Clash and the all-star race) of the NASCAR schedule, which will have five races on FOX and nine on FS1. The remaining 24 Cup events will be split among four other broadcasters (Amazon Prime Video has five races, TNT has five races, NBC has four races and USA has 10). Shanks said he spoke Wednesday to NASCAR Chairman Jim France about the IndyCar deal.\n\n\"There's going to be a great halo effect for all motorsports,\" Shanks said. \"Once you start to put the two schedules together -- both Indy and NASCAR -- there's going to be a great halo effect of motorsports because a lot of times they're going to be leading in and out of each other.\n\n\"And so the FOX network is not going to be starting from scratch. When we do NASCAR races, you're already going to have a motorsports audience for some of the lead-ins to NASCAR races. And I think that circulation and promotion is going to fit both series. Definitely.\"\n\nAs far as the exact lead-ins, start times for the 2025 IndyCar Series races were not announced and NASCAR has not announced its 2025 schedule. It should release its Cup schedule by the end of the month.\n\n\"Recently we announced that we're going to put sports on Friday nights on the broadcast network, so that allowed us to move some UFL football games off the network from the weekend on to Friday night, so you'll see UFL on Friday night, which freed up some windows as well,\" Shanks said.\n\n\"There was a lot of moving pieces to make this a reality. Strategically, we'll continue to work with Indy on start times and windows to maximize the potential audience.\"\n\nAmong other details of the announcement:\n\n--The length of the deal was not announced. It is a multiyear deal. Miles would not comment on whether IndyCar got an increase from its previous NBC deal.\n\n--The windows on FOX for the races will be 2.5 hours, except the Indianapolis 500 will have a 5-hour window.\n\n--The blackout of the Indy 500 telecast in the Indianapolis area remains in effect.\n\n--Practice and qualifying for all races will be on FS1 or FS2 (Indianapolis 500 qualifying will be on FOX). The INDY NXT development series will air on FS1 or FS2, with the majority of races on FS1.\n\nThis is the second television package negotiated by IndyCar since Roger Penske purchased the series following the 2019 season.\n\n\"I feel like this has been kind of a long time coming -- IndyCar and the Indianapolis 500 is truly a crown jewel in not only motorsports but also sports in general,\" Shanks said. \"It truly captures the nation's attention. And as you guys have seen, under the leadership, ownership of the Penskes, there's just incredible momentum if you're ever around Indianapolis in May.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-wheel_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open-wheel car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indy_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indy NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Monster_Energy_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(broadcasting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackout (broadcasting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1408/814/indynews.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649443", "eventUri": "eng-9649443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

At least as far as TV goes. Is FOX abandoning NASCAR for IndyCar? Or can the two coexist on the network together?\n\nToday it was announced that FOX and IndyCar had struck a new media rights deal. The network, which has received harsh criticism for its NASCAR broadcasts, is not only adding IndyCar. FOX will air all 17 points-paying races on their main network.\n\nJeff Gluck of The Athletic drew a quick comparison to how NASCAR is currently broadcast on FOX and FS1. The network will carry 14 Cup Series races in 2025 but only five of those are scheduled to be on the main network.\n\nIndyCar also gets two additional days on big FOX with qualifying for the Indianapolis 500.\n\nIt sounds like FOX is making a big investment in IndyCar. However, it also sounds like they are making a priority for the sport over the already existing NASCAR product. A product that they just renewed the media rights to, worth in total $7.7B over seven years.\n\nThen again, what will it be like to have the Daytona 500 and Indy 500 on the same network? What about double-header weekends of racing on FOX? They lose out on the Coca-Cola 600, but adding the Indy 500 more than makes up for that.\n\nThere are concerns for NASCAR and IndyCar fans. When it comes to the Indy 500, NBC did a great job of making it feel like the hugely important race that it is. Even with the issues that Peacock has as a streaming platform and the lack of promotion largely, it was a solid product to watch.\n\nFans are right to be concerned that the problems that plague NASCAR races from a production standpoint could bleed into IndyCar coverage. Perhaps it will raise the overall value and quality of both?\n\nIf I am a NASCAR executive, this move from FOX doesn't make me too happy. A quick look at ratings would tell you that the Cup Series has more value. Also, what happens if and when FOX decides to move the IndyCar races to FS1 in 2026 or 2027?\n\nFOX has to put an effort into the IndyCar broadcasts. They have to learn from the mistakes they have made in the Cup Series. Motorsports fans deserve better. It also feels like FOX may not see themselves making it to the end of the new NASCAR media rights deal.

Pato O'Ward made an interesting comparison.\n\nAfter returning to the Milwaukee Mile with a doubleheader in 2024, the NTT IndyCar Series will race the venerable track just once in 2025 and not on Labor Day weekend.\n\nThe implications go deeper than one series, though.\n\nWith IndyCar moving ahead a week to Aug. 24 on the schedule announced Thursday, the weekend headlined by the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series in 2023 and '24 will have to shift for 2025, assuming it returns.\n\nNASCAR and promoter Track Enterprises have not announced 2025 plans, but the trucks are expected to race at the Mile again. The series competed there from 1995-2009 but was away for 13 years before Track brought NASCAR back last season.\n\nTrack Enterprises helped rekindle racing on the oval when it brought the regional ASA Midwest Tour stock cars to the Mile in 2019 and then added the ARCA national series and then trucks. The speedway's last race open to spectators before then was a 2015 IndyCar event promoted by a group led by champion driver and team owner Michael Andretti.\n\nState Fair, which owns the Mile, independently came to an agreement last year with IndyCar to return for 2024 and '25 with the series helping to put on the races. The deal included more than $3 million in public and private money spent on renovations and upgrades to the facility.\n\nThe Mile opened in 1903, eight years before the first Indianapolis 500, and has been the site of 113 Indy-style championship races.\n\nThe biggest change on the 2025 IndyCar schedule announced Thursday morning was the anticipated move of the television package to Fox from NBC, the primary rightsholder since 2018.\n\nAfter that, the changes are relatively minor, although both Wisconsin race weekends were affected.\n\nIn addition to Milwaukee moving ahead, Road America shifts back two weeks, becoming the third stop after the Indianapolis 500. Race day is June 22.\n\nThe acclaimed road course outside Elkhart Lake announced Sunday it had reached a multiyear agreement for IndyCar to return.\n\nThe 500 is scheduled for May 25, followed by the June 1 Detroit street course event and the June 15 oval race at World Wide Technology Raceway outside St. Louis.\n\nMilwaukee remains the second-last stop on a more compact schedule that finishes Aug. 31 at Nashville Superspeedway.\n\nIndyCar's 2024 Labor Day weekend at the Mile was seen as a good news-bad news development for Wisconsin racing fans.\n\nOn one hand, the track - which has not hosted IndyCar since 2015 - not only returned to the schedule but did so with two 250-milers that are integral to the championship, and the event has a built-in rain date on Monday.\n\nOn the other, though, the weekend runs into a classic end-of-summer travel weekend when many people have family traditions that don't include the racetrack. Also, the fanbase could be split, leaving relatively few people in the grandstands each day.\n\nThe first race of the Milwaukee doubleheader is among those this year scheduled to appear on Peacock, NBC's streaming service. The broadcast schedule was split across the network (nine races), the USA cable channel (six races) and Peacock (two).\n\nNext season all broadcasts are scheduled for Fox, including qualifying days for the Indy 500. The network recently signed a seven-year deal to remain a NASCAR television partner that begins next year. That means Fox will have both the Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500 in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "wausaudailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wausau Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The calendar, which includes a full slate of network TV windows on FOX, continues the trend of 17 points-paying races.\n\nIn its traditional spot on the calendar, the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg kicks off the 2025 IndyCar season on March 2, with the finale again at Nashville Superspeedway -- same as this year (though it wasn't the original 2024 plan) -- with next season ending on Labor Day weekend (Aug. 31) before the start of the NFL season.\n\n'We're back as a team again.'

Pato O'Ward made an interesting comparison.\n\nAfter returning to the Milwaukee Mile with a doubleheader in 2024, the NTT IndyCar Series will race the venerable track just once in 2025 and not on Labor Day weekend.\n\nThe implications go deeper than one series, though.\n\nWith IndyCar moving ahead a week to Aug. 24 on the schedule announced Thursday, the weekend headlined by the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series in 2023 and '24 will have to shift for 2025, assuming it returns.\n\nNASCAR and promoter Track Enterprises have not announced 2025 plans, but the trucks are expected to race at the Mile again. The series competed there from 1995-2009 but was away for 13 years before Track brought NASCAR back last season.\n\nTrack Enterprises helped rekindle racing on the oval when it brought the regional ASA Midwest Tour stock cars to the Mile in 2019 and then added the ARCA national series and then trucks. The speedway's last race open to spectators before then was a 2015 IndyCar event promoted by a group led by champion driver and team owner Michael Andretti.\n\nState Fair, which owns the Mile, independently came to an agreement last year with IndyCar to return for 2024 and '25 with the series helping to put on the races. The deal included more than $3 million in public and private money spent on renovations and upgrades to the facility.\n\nKallmann: Milwaukee Mile's biggest season in years might be hurt by disjointed promotion\n\nMore: 'There's a learning curve': IndyCar hybrid system brings new challenges to the Milwaukee Mile\n\nThe Mile opened in 1903, eight years before the first Indianapolis 500, and has been the site of 113 Indy-style championship races.\n\nThe biggest change on the 2025 IndyCar schedule announced Thursday morning was the anticipated move of the television package to Fox from NBC, the primary rightsholder since 2018.\n\nAfter that, the changes are relatively minor, although both Wisconsin race weekends were affected.\n\nIn addition to Milwaukee moving ahead, Road America shifts back two weeks, becoming the third stop after the Indianapolis 500. Race day is June 22.\n\nThe acclaimed road course outside Elkhart Lake announced Sunday it had reached a multiyear agreement for IndyCar to return.\n\nThe 500 is scheduled for May 25, followed by the June 1 Detroit street course event and the June 15 oval race at World Wide Technology Raceway outside St. Louis.\n\nHow will getting off Labor Day weekend affect the Milwaukee Mile?\n\nMilwaukee remains the second-last stop on a more compact schedule that finishes Aug. 31 at Nashville Superspeedway.\n\nIndyCar's 2024 Labor Day weekend at the Mile was seen as a good news-bad news development for Wisconsin racing fans.\n\nOn one hand, the track - which has not hosted IndyCar since 2015 - not only returned to the schedule but did so with two 250-milers that are integral to the championship, and the event has a built-in rain date on Monday.\n\nOn the other, though, the weekend runs into a classic end-of-summer travel weekend when many people have family traditions that don't include the racetrack. Also, the fanbase could be split, leaving relatively few people in the grandstands each day.\n\nThe first race of the Milwaukee doubleheader is among those this year scheduled to appear on Peacock, NBC's streaming service. The broadcast schedule was split across the network (nine races), the USA cable channel (six races) and Peacock (two).\n\nNext season all broadcasts are scheduled for Fox, including qualifying days for the Indy 500. The network recently signed a seven-year deal to remain a NASCAR television partner that begins next year. That means Fox will have both the Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500 in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The other announcement was that the 2025 NTT IndyCar Series schedule was revealed, with all races airing on FOX.\n\nDrivers have been weighing in on the news throughout the day on social media. Some of those drivers have included Scott McLaughlin, Josef Newgarden and Colton Herta.\n\nHere is a look at the 2025 schedule:\n\nAll of the races listed above will be points races for the 2025 season. This year, the event at The Thermal Club was an exhibition race that had no impact on the series championship.\n\nThe 2024 IndyCar schedule also features two races at Milwaukee Mile, but next year's event at the track will consist of only one points race.\n\nThis year's IndyCar season has ten events remaining, with its next race taking place at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca on Sunday, June 23.

(AP) -- Patrick Cantlay has taken the early lead in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2. He holed a bunker shot for birdie early and made a couple of birdies late for a 65 to lead by one over Ludvig Aberg among the morning wave. Tiger Woods opened with a 74. Masters champion Scottie Scheffler was playing in the afternoon. Cantlay is ranked within the top 10 in the world, but he hasn't done much of anything in the majors. The U.S. Open is one month after Cantlay's best friend in golf, Xander Schauffele, won his first major at the PGA Championship.\n\nAtlanta Falcons forfeit fifth-round pick, fined for tampering with Kirk Cousins\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons were stripped of a fifth-round pick in next year's draft on Thursday for violating the NFL's anti-tampering rules prior to signing quarterback Kirk Cousins. The Falcons and Cousins agreed on a four-year, $180 million contract with $100 million guaranteed shortly after the league's 52-hour legal tampering window opened. It's normal for teams and players to reach agreements quickly and there were other players who agreed to deals even before Cousins. But Cousins' comments at his introductory news conference raised questions that led to the NFL's investigation.\n\nAnalysis: Jerry West and Kobe Bryant were a match from Day 1, and the Lakers reaped the benefits\n\nIt was during the NBA Finals in 2010. Kobe Bryant was asked a question about whether he thought he was the greatest Los Angeles Laker ever. The answer was immediate. \"No,\" Bryant said. He wasn't being difficult or misleading and the question was fair, especially because Bryant surely would have been on the short list for such a title. But in Bryant's mind, that distinction -- greatest Laker ever -- belonged to only one person. To him, the only answer was Jerry West.\n\nRafael Nadal will skip Wimbledon so he doesn't have to switch from grass to clay for the Olympics\n\nRafael Nadal is going to skip Wimbledon, as expected, and instead prepare for the Paris Olympics by entering a clay-court tournament in Bastad, Sweden. The 22-time Grand Slam champion said Thursday he wants to just remain on clay, rather than switching over to grass for the All England Club and then needing to go back to clay. The Summer Games will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting on July 27. That is the site of the French Open, where Nadal has won a record 14 titles. Nadal will play doubles -- with Carlos Alcaraz -- and singles at the OIympics. Wimbledon runs from July 1-14.\n\nNFL players union could propose trading spring practices for longer training camp\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- NFL teams wrapped up their mandatory minicamps this week leading into about a month-long break before the start of a grueling season that could approach seven months for the teams that make the Super Bowl. The timeline of spring practice followed by a break and then training camp has been a familiar one for years. The NFLPA is contemplating proposing a major upheaval to this schedule, replacing spring practices with a longer training camp. It's a plan that has not been met with wide acceptance, with several players and coaches decrying the elimination of OTAs and minicamps in May and June.\n\nTatum, Brown help Celtics hold off huge Dallas rally for 106-99 win, 3-0 lead in NBA Finals\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Jayson Tatum scored 31 points and the Boston Celtics held off a furious Dallas rally to reach the brink of a record 18th championship with a 106-99 victory over the Mavericks for a 3-0 lead in the NBA Finals. No team has rallied from 3-0 down in an NBA playoff series. Jaylen Brown had 30 points, eight rebounds and eight assists as the Celtics extended their franchise record with a 10th consecutive playoff victory. The Mavs almost pulled off a crazy comeback to avoid the big hole. Boston led 91-70 at the end of a 20-5 run early in the fourth quarter before Dallas answered with a 22-2 spurt to get within a point.\n\nUS views Copa America as last big challenge before hosting 2026 World Cup\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- In a region that provides few tests, the United States views the Copa America as its last significant challenge ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Eighteen players from the 2022 World Cup roster were in training camp ahead of the tournament. The U.S. opens against Bolivia on June 23, plays Panama four days later and closes the group stage against Uruguay. The U.S. could meet Brazil in the quarterfinals. Players and staff view this as another step toward June 12, 2026, when the Americans play their World Cup opener in Inglewood, California.\n\nIndyCar moves to Fox Sports in 2025 after 16 seasons with NBC. Fox now has Daytona 500 and Indy 500\n\nFox Sports has acquired the rights to broadcast IndyCar starting in 2025. The move gives the network two of the biggest races in the world, the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Daytona 500. Fox Sports already broadcasts the first half of the NASCAR schedule. Terms of the deal between IndyCar and Fox Sports were not revealed but Fox promised all the races would receive network broadcasts, as well as qualifying for the Indy 500. NBC had held the rights to IndyCar since 2009. Fox Sports says all races with be on Fox and the Fox Sports app, while Fox Deportes will carry Spanish-language coverage.\n\nUkraine arrives at Euro 2024 to a patriotic welcome and vivid reminder of the war at home\n\nWIESBADEN, Germany (AP) -- The Ukraine men's soccer team was made to feel at home for its first practice in Germany for the European Championship. Patriotic songs were broadcast and thousands of exiled Ukrainians watching in the stadium at Wiesbaden on Thursday. There was a vivid reminder of the war at home that is a uniting force for this Ukraine squad. Each player had a ball to give to a fan and Oleksandr Zinchenko presented his to a military veteran who had prosthetic legs below each knee. Near the stadium is the United States military headquarters in Germany that's coordinating delivery of military aid from Ukraine's allies.\n\nFormer NBA star Luol Deng has steered South Sudan's basketball journey to Paris Olympics\n\nIt's been only 13 years since South Sudan emerged from civil war and became an independent nation. For former NBA star Luol Deng that journey has a parallel connection with his introduction to basketball through fellow Sudanese countryman and former NBA player Manute Bol. That meeting, as well as connections Deng made during time at small New Jersey boarding school, helped steer him and his South Sudan squad on a path to making its Olympic basketball debut in Paris. Deng believes the team, known as \"The Bright Stars,\" can be a uniting force for a country of 11 million people that's still finding its way after years of conflict.", "source": {"uri":

Oisin Peavoy, 38, who resides at an apartment building on Granby Row, Dublin 1, was arrested following an incident on Tuesday morning. A court heard witnesses heard upset children saying, \u201cWe are going to die\u201d during the incident. He was charged with four offences, including two counts under weapons legislation for the production of a knife at Gardiner Street and Parnell Square in the north inner city. The other two charges are under the Public Order Act for threatening, abusive, or insulting words and behaviour at the two locations. He was brought to Mountjoy Garda station, where he declined the offer of legal representation. Peavoy was charged and held pending his appearance before Judge Gerard Jones at Dublin District Court today. Solicitor Tracy Horan told Judge Jones the man\u2019s family had approached her for assistance, and it had been suggested he would be remanded in custody for a psychiatric assessment. Detective Garda Paul Griffin told the court he intended to object to bail, and Peavoy insisted he would represent himself. The court heard that Peavoy\u2019s replies to two charges were: \u201cI object, I have evidence that this is not true.\u201d He also answered \u201cI object\u201d and \u201cThis is the only one that is somewhat lawful\u201d. Outlining the evidence, Detective Garda Griffin said that it was alleged the accused was armed with a knife. The weapon was handed into court, in a protective casing, for the judge to inspect. When the judge asked if there had been \u201cany public danger,\u201d the detective replied: \u201cYes.\u201d He said that at 8.42 am, the accused brandished a knife at Parnell Square and then, while acting erratically and aggressively, threatened a woman with her baby telling her to \u201cfuck off\u201d. \u201cThis was totally unprovoked,\u201d he said, adding that there was a coach full of cr\u00e8che children, which the accused blocked with his hands outstretched. The court heard the children saw him and became \u201chysterical\u201d, and two of them were allegedly overheard saying \u201cWe\u2019re going to die\u201d. The second incident was 35 minutes later, when the accused allegedly brandished the knife at Gardiner Street. It was claimed he went up to a bus carrying school children, but the driver closed the doors. It was alleged the accused \u201cstared at the driver and pointed at the knife in a sheath in his belt in a clear attempt to intimidate the driver\u201d. The court heard the children were aged six to 12 years. In court, Peavoy initially denied his name, made reference to a \u201cking\u2019s army\u201d, recognising the court, wanting \u201cthe Hague here\u201d and he cited the legal authority of EU. Judge Jones said he could not force the accused to have a solicitor to act on his behalf. Remanding him in custody, he added: \u201cThis man is a danger to himself and to the public in his present state, the children involved.\u201d He praised the garda\u00ed and actions of the bus drivers who protected the children. Peavoy will appear again at Cloverhill District Court on 5 June via video link. The judge directed medical attention in custody.", "summary": "Oisin Peavoy was remanded in custody after a judge held he was a \u201cdanger to the public in his present state\u201d.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/oisin-peavoy-threatened-woman-children-knife-parnell-square-6392752-May2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6392752/river/?height=400&version=6392776", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:04:59", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.428}

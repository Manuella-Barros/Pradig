US bombings that killed civilians included \u201cas we pulled out of Afghanistan, where we conducted an airstrike which tragically killed a father and some of his kids,\u201d he said. \u201cWe atoned for it, we learned from it, and we put in place procedures to try to prevent that from happening again, and that\u2019s what our expectations would be in this case.\u201d Kirby\u2019s comments came after Israel reportedly killed over 40 displaced Palestinians on Sunday in an airstrike. He said that two senior Hamas leaders had also been killed in the bombing. \u201cHamas itself put out a statement celebrating the martyrdom of two of its fighters\u2026 So I don\u2019t know how anybody could dispute that they weren\u2019t trying to go after Hamas in a targeted, precise way in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Israelis have said they used 37-pound bombs, precision guided munitions. A 37-pound bomb is not a big bomb, and it is exactly the kind of munition\u2026 \u201cIf, in fact, that\u2019s what they used, it is certainly indicative of an effort to be discrete, targeted and precise,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, obviously this had tragic results, and obviously that needs to be investigated, and we need to know why even using small-diameter, precision guided munitions this was able to happen, But we\u2019ll have to let the Israelis get to the bottom of that.\u201d", "summary": "<img width=\"810\" height=\"486\" src=\"https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Kirby.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Kirby.jpg 1000w, https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Kirby-300x180.jpg 300w, https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Kirby-768x461.jpg 768w, https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Kirby-810x486.jpg 810w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" />WASHINGTON (Ariana News): White House spokesman John Kirby defended Israel amid international outrage after an airstrike reportedly killed dozens of civilians in the Gaza Strip \u2014 saying the US military \u201cdid the same thing.\u201d \u201cWe have conducted airstrikes in places like Iraq and Afghanistan where, tragically, we caused civilian casualties,\u201d he said \u2014 adding that [&#8230;]", "url": "https://thefrontierpost.com/john-kirby-likens-israeli-airstrike-to-us-bombings-in-iraq-afghanistan/", "image": "https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Kirby.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:07:12", "author": "The Frontier Post", "authors": ["The Frontier Post"], "language": "en", "source_country": "pk", "sentiment": -0.177}

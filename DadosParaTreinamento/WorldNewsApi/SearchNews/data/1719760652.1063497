Bradshaw Hall Primary School, on Vernon Close in hulme>Cheadle Hulme, was inspected on March 12 and 13, and given an overall rating of 'outstanding.' It is a community school primary school with more than 450 pupils aged between three and 11 years. Ofsted found that children were 'delighted to come to this school each day', supported by teachers with 'exceptionally high expectations' of what they can achieve. The quality of pupils' work was judged to be 'outstanding', with learners able to talk in depth about their subjects.

Pupils take an active interest in their neighbourhood, Ofsted found, especially with music, often giving performances during local events. They have also fostered a strong sense of community, treating adults with 'kindness and respect' and supporting each other. Children told the visiting inspectors that 'everyone is welcome in their school' despite any differences they may have. The outstanding rating is an upgrade from the previous 'good' inspection from the education body. During an inspection in July 2022, Ofsted found that the school was well on the way to getting an outstanding rating, with 'evidence of improved performance' in how the school operates. Headteacher Chris Bagnall described Bradshaw Hall as the \"the beating heart of the Cheadle Hulme community.\" He added: \"It really is a special place where children can realise our golden aims of becoming successful learners, resilient individuals and responsible citizens. \"We are proud to serve a large catchment area and welcome a diverse demographic of pupils in school, including recently welcoming a number of children who have relocated from Hong Kong, who are all given the opportunity to go on a learning journey of awe and wonderment, high standards of academic achievement, and a genuine adventure to fire the imagination. \"The children at Bradshaw Hall are encouraged to think big and we have every confidence that they will go on to achieve big things.\"", "summary": "Pupils said that 'everyone is welcome' at their school.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/stockport-school-beating-heart-community-29257791", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29257758.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS334098428.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:34:09", "author": "Declan Carey", "authors": ["Declan Carey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.374}

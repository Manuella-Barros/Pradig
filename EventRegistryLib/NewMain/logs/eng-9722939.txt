The garden's stone walls look out over the Tiber River in Rome near Vatican City.\n\nThis was discovered at Piazza Pia, as announced by the Italian Ministry of Culture. Archaeologists cleared away rubble and discovered a lead water pipe with an inscription that read: \"C(ai) C\u00e6saris Aug(usti) Germanici.\"\n\nResearchers identified this as referring to Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, famously known as Caligula. His soldiers affectionately called him \"Little Boot,\" a nickname from his childhood.\n\nThe garden likely belonged to Caligula\n\nThe garden is believed by researchers to have belonged to the notorious Roman Emperor Caligula. This is based on the inscription on a lead water pipe. Caligula, known for his tyrannical reign and cruel treatment of the Senate, ascended the throne in 37 AD.\n\nJust four years later, in 41 AD, he was assassinated by the Praetorian Guard, the very officials tasked with his protection, as reported by Live Science.\n\nThis finding is backed by a passage in the ancient text \"On the Embassy to Gaius,\" written by the Egyptian philosopher Philo of Alexandria. It recounts Caligula's meeting with a Jewish representative from Alexandria at a large garden near the Tiber River.\n\nDuring this period, there was tension and violence between Jewish and Greek Alexandrians over religious matters. Despite the Jews' pleas for religious freedom, Caligula favored the Greeks.\n\nCaligula's garden found near the garden of Agrippina the Elder\n\nAlessio De Cristofaro, an archaeologist from the government agency in Rome, responsible for archaeology, fine arts, and landscape preservation, stated that the discovery is important because Piazza Pia is located near the \"Horti Agrippinae.\" It was the garden of Agrippina the Elder, who was Caligula's mother.\n\nThe Horti Agrippinae was a grand villa estate situated on the western bank of the Tiber River near the present-day location of St. Peter's Basilica. The estate stretched down to the river, featuring a terrace with a portico.\n\nMoreover, this area became popular for rich families. It was where they built their large and luxurious homes, called \"Horti,\" around the end of the first century BC.\n\nThe recently uncovered pipe resembles another one discovered in the early 1900s inscribed with the name Iulia Augusta, the second wife of Augustus and grandmother of Germanicus. Researchers suggest that the property may have been inherited by Germanicus and later passed to his wife, Agrippina the Elder, before eventually coming into Caligula's possession.\n\nAlongside the pipe, archaeologists unearthed slabs of Roman pottery and terra-cotta figures depicting mythological scenes, likely used to adorn rooftops during ancient times.", "source": {"uri":

Behind this embankment, archaeologists located the foundations of a colonnaded portico and a vast area that was used as a garden, the statement says.\n\nThere is good reason to attribute the site to Caligula, whose brief and violent reign lasted from 37 to 41 C.E., say lead archaeologist Dora Cirone and scientific director Alessio De Cristofaro.\n\nIt was known that the area housed the Gardens of Agrippina the Elder, Caligula's mother (not to be confused with his sister, Agrippina the Younger, who birthed another infamous emperor: Nero)..\n\nBut the real clincher was the unearthing of a lead water pipe stamped with the name of the site's owner, one Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus. Gaius was in fact the real name of the emperor we know as Caligula, an affectionate nickname given to him in youth and which means \"little boot\" - in reference to the caligae, the boots worn by Roman legionnaires.\n\nThe inscribed pipe confirms that archaeologists have found the remains of Agrippina's gardens, mentioned in the works of Philo of Alexandria, a Jewish philosopher who lived in the first half of the first century, De Cristofaro says.\n\nIt was Philo who led a failed embassy to Rome, after a series of anti-Jewish riots, considered by some scholars the first pogrom in history, erupted in Alexandria, his home town. Since its founding by Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.E. the Hellenistic city had been a melting pot of cultures, with Jews making up almost a third of the population.\n\nBut religious and political tensions were brewing with the Greek community, which saw the Jews as favoring the Roman occupation of Egypt.\n\nIn the riots that exploded in 38 C.E. thousands were killed, synagogues were razed or desecrated and the Jews were driven from most of the city, Philo relates. The timing was ripe as Rome was led by Caligula, who insisted on being worshipped as a living god, a demand the Greeks had no trouble acceding to, but which was anathema for the Jews and put them at the disadvantage in any dealings with the emperor.\n\nNevertheless, in 39 B.C.E., a delegation led by Philo made its way to Rome, to plead for Caligula's protection. In his text, Legatio ad Gaium (The Embassy to Gaius), Philo recounts that they were first granted audience with the emperor \"in the plains on the banks of the Tiber, for he happened to be walking about in his mother's garden.\" That is, most likely, the site uncovered recently in Rome.\n\nLocating a spot mentioned in a 2,000-year-old history is a thrilling discovery, and even more so from the reign of Caligula. After his assassination in 41 C.E., this emperor suffered a damnatio memoriae, his name being effaced from monuments, statues and coins. But all that was still in the future.\n\nOn that day in 39 C.E., ambling around the gardens he had inherited from his mother, Gaius Caligula was in fact quite gracious with the Jewish ambassadors. \"He conversed with us formally, and waved his right hand to us in a protecting manner, giving us significant tokens of his good will,\" Philo recounts. \"He said, 'I myself will listen to what you have to say at the first favorable opportunity'.\"\n\nThe god turns querulous\n\nThe delegates had to wait for months to see the emperor again. Meanwhile they got grim news. Greeks in Yavne, a coastal town in Judea, had built a small shrine to the emperor, which had been promptly destroyed by local Jews.\n\nInformed of this affront, the ever-volatile Caligula had ordered his legate in Syria to build and erect a statue of himself in the Temple in Jerusalem, a sacrilegious act that was widely expected to bring the restive province into open revolt.\n\nPhilo and his fellow delegates found themselves having to plead also the case of their fellow Jews in Judea. Finally they met Caligula again.\n\nThis second meeting did not take place in the gardens along the Tiber but in the emperor's palace on the Esquiline hill, remains of which were uncovered a few years ago, also during construction work. That audience was a disaster.\n\nCaligula was clearly not interested in hearing the ambassador's pleas, and instead darted through the rooms and gardens of his palace, ordering new and lavish improvements, Philo relates. In between his home design projects he amused himself by launching barbed accusations at the delegates, telling them \"you are haters of God, inasmuch as you do not think that I am a god,\" and questioning them on their faith by asking why they did not partake of pork.\n\nPhilo and friends were ultimately unable to even plead their case, with the emperor dismissing them by saying: \"These men do not appear to me to be wicked so much as unfortunate and foolish, in not believing that I have been endowed with the nature of God.\"\n\nCaligula's plans to erect a statue of himself in the Temple were only put off by a combination of delays concocted, at great personal risk, by his legate in Syria, who understood the explosive nature of the affront to Jews, and a personal request by Herod Agrippa, a member of the Herodian dynasty and a friend of the emperor.\n\nUltimately, the scheme was finally shelved when Caligula was assassinated by his own guards in 41 C.E.\n\nHis successor, the more level-headed Claudius, took a more conciliatory approach with the Jews. Judea would be spared major conflict for a few more decades - until tensions would be reignited under another infamous emperor, Nero, leading to the breakout of the First Jewish Revolt in 66 C.E. and the subsequent destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem in 70 C.E.\n\nRest in piss\n\nCaligula's monumental garden on the Tiber did not fare much better and was largely razed and replaced by other structures. Most notably, in the 2nd or 3rd century, the site was covered with a fullonica, a Roman laundry, according to the culture ministry statement.\n\nThe archaeologists have unearthed large washing basins from this phase, in which the water from the Tiber was mixed with a detergent, usually urine, to wipe off stains from clothes, the statement says.\n\nArchaeologists are currently working to remove the remains of the laundry and the earlier finds from Caligula's garden to make way for the planned underpass. The antiquities will be placed in the gardens of Castel Sant'Angelo, just next door, where they will be accessible to the public, the ministry says.\n\nIn fact, the ruins from Caligula's time were only found once archaeologists began removing the remains of the laundry, which lay above them.\n\nIt is not known whether the foul-smelling, urine-using laundry was purposely placed upon the remains of the gardens owned by one of Rome's most despised emperors, but there is certainly some poetic justice in knowing that Caligula's dreams of being worshipped as a god ended up being drowned in pee.",

Source: Vatican News.\n\nA luxurious garden facing the Tiber River has been unearthed in the area designated for an underpass for the 2025 Jubilee. The garden is bordered by a massive, terraced wall made of squared travertine blocks, running parallel to the river. Alongside this wall are the brick foundations of a colonaded portico.\n\nFollowing the discovery of a well-preserved fullonica (laundry) from the second half of the 2nd century AD, featuring complete sections such as dolia (large \"decapitated\" jars used as washing basins) and three rinsing basins, the excavation, led by the Special Superintendence of Rome under Daniela Porro, with field coordination by archaeologist Dora Cirone and scientific direction by Alessio De Cristofaro, has documented three other building phases, from the Augustan age to that of Nero.\n\nAmong the findings, a particularly significant one is a fragment of a lead water pipe (fistula aquaria), inscribed with the name \"C(ai) Caesaris Aug(usti) Germanici,\" identifying Caligula, who was emperor from 37 to 41 AD, as the owner. This allowed the experts to name the proprietor of the water supply system and date the first construction phase of this complex.\n\nThe inscription is crucial for other reasons as well, noted Mr De Cristofaro, as it indicates that this area was part of the Horti (garden) of Agrippina the Elder, Caligula's mother. In the last century, the discovery of other lead pipes at Piazza Pia inscribed with the name \"Iulia Augusta,\" likely referring to Livia Drusilla, Augustus' second wife and Germanicus' grandmother, suggests that the villa was a family inheritance passed down through the Augustan line to Caligula.\n\nAmong the sophisticated finds are several Campana Plaques from the first half of the 1st century, reused to cover later drains. These are terracotta reliefs, made using moulds, depicting heraldic and mythological scenes that originally decorated a roof.", "source": {"uri": "cathnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CathNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debra_vermeer@cathnews.com", "name": "Debra Vermeer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Portico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caligula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travertine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travertine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vatican Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fullo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augustus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decapitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippina_the_Elder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agrippina the Elder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanicus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germanicus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heraldry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terracotta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Garden_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Garden Accessories", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cathnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Excavations-at-Vatican-Radio-Vatican-News-461.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722939", "eventUri": "eng-9722939", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

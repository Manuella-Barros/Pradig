Sherry Hopson had no idea the man she was dating was a serial killer. But she did begin to notice startling behaviors from Lindahl during their time together. Hopson tells the story of her encounters with Lindahl on the newest episode of People Magazine Investigates: Surviving a Serial Killer. Lindahl, the killer at the center of the episode, \u201cSurviving the Handsome Devil,\u201d is known to have killed at least four people, though the true number could be much higher. Lindahl, who died in 1981 after murdering an 18-year-old man, also committed multiple sexual assaults. One of the first red flags Hopson noticed during her time with Lindahl was his anger, which she talks about in a clip from the show shared with PEOPLE. \u201cBruce would get angry very easily whenever I said no,\u201d Hopson recalls. \u201cHe had a temper on him, a very, very quick temper.\u201d Hopson recounts one incident in which she found another woman\u2019s earring in Lindahl\u2019s car and confronted him about it. \u201cHe took it out of my hand and he said, \u2018It\u2019s my sister\u2019s earring,\u2019\u201d Hopson says. \u201cAnd he rolled down the window and threw it out.\u201d Hopson was surprised that Lindahl would throw away an earring he claimed belonged to his sister, and says he shot back that his sister \u201cdidn\u2019t need it.\u201d Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

There were other alarming signs. \u201cSexually, he got a little rough,\u201d Hopson says. \u201cThere were times where I woke up and never remembered falling asleep. \u201cAnd I'd wake up and I'd be late for work and a couple of times I'd be really groggy and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, I can't wake up.\u2019\u201d Lindahl responded by telling her not to worry, that it would wear off. \u201cNow I look back at that and think, the guy drugged me and I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Hopson says.

Plantation Plaza and an adjacent retail street, located in the middle of the first four Build-To-Order (BTO) projects in Tengah, will have 75 shops in total. A Giant supermarket, a Koufu foodcourt and a McDonald\u2019s fast-food restaurant were the first three shops to open. Signs at the centre, which occupies more than 10,000 sq m, also showed that lifestyle shop Daiso is set to open. Hong Kah North MP Amy Khor, who visited the centre on the morning of June 28, said residents have been asking for more amenities within the new town. Dr Khor, who is also Senior Minister of State for Transport, and Sustainability and the Environment, noted that the Housing Board brought in a FairPrice grocery truck and food vending machines to serve residents in Plantation Grange and Plantation Acres in December. \u201cBut, of course, nothing beats having the physical stores here,\u201d she said, adding that the remaining shops will open progressively. Dr Khor added that the first bus interchange in Tengah, located in Tengah Boulevard, will open soon. \u201cOnce it\u2019s open, we can introduce new bus services and extend existing services so that it will enhance connectivity,\u201d she said. Residents are now served by two bus services. Bus service 992 takes residents to Bukit Batok MRT station and bus interchange, and Le Quest mall, while bus service 870 goes to Jurong Town Hall bus interchange. The newly opened five-storey neighbourhood centre, which is integrated with the Plantation Village BTO project, will have other eateries, a clinic and enrichment centres. Plantation Grange resident Saraswathi Suppiah, 72, said she had been looking forward to the centre\u2019s opening since moving into her flat in May. \u201cIt\u2019s troublesome to travel to Bukit Batok to buy groceries and, sometimes, I have to wait more than 20 minutes for the bus to arrive. Now, I just have to walk 10 minutes to go to Giant,\u201d the housewife said. HDB said on June 28 that the grocery truck will stop operating with the opening of the 1,825 sq m Giant supermarket, while the vending machines will remain. For logistics assistant Muhammad Haizrul, 30, the neighbourhood centre is a five-minute walk from his home in Plantation Grove. He had been going to Bukit Batok \u2013 a 15-minute walk \u2013 to buy food and groceries since he moved into his three-room flat in May. \u201cI like that now there is a supermarket nearby. I also hope there would be more halal food options,\u201d he said. \u201cI find living in Tengah convenient as it\u2019s easy to get to malls in Jurong East, Bukit Batok and Clementi by public transport. It\u2019s even better that there are now shops less than 10 minutes away on foot,\u201d he said. Ms Phyu War, store manager of the Giant outlet in Plantation Plaza, said she was excited about the store\u2019s opening, having spent the last two weeks preparing for it. \u201cResidents said they have been waiting for quite long for a supermarket, and they are happy that Giant is ready,\u201d she said. HDB said on June 28 that most of the shops in the Plantation Plaza neighbourhood centre are expected to open by the fourth quarter of 2024. Among the food and beverage outlets opening are Thai restaurant I Love Sukhothai, local eatery Lau Wang Claypot Delights and Japanese restaurant Kei Kaisendon. Residents can also look forward to athleisure store Skechers and Happy Fish Swim School, which holds indoor swimming lessons. HDB said it worked to expedite Giant and Koufu\u2019s move into the neighbourhood centre \u2013 it took around two months after the centre received its temporary occupation permit in April \u2013 by facilitating site meetings and accelerating the approval of necessary permits, among other efforts. The retail street outside the neighbourhood centre is next to a green connector known as Plantation Farmway, which links the housing precincts and residents to recreational facilities. A portion of the connector between Plantation Acres and Plantation Grange was completed in May, giving residents access to playgrounds, fitness corners and seating areas, HDB said. The entire stretch will be completed by December. HDB added that four pre-schools will open in Tengah\u2019s Plantation district by the end of 2024. A community club will also be completed in 2024.", "summary": "<p class=\"lead\">Residents in Tengah will be served by a supermarket, foodcourt and fast-food restaurant with the opening of the new town\u2019s first neighbourhood centre on June 28.</p>\n\n<p>Plantation Plaza and an adjacent retail street, located in the...", "url": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/first-neighbourhood-centre-tengah-opens-supermarket-foodcourt", "image": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/2024062824848299img0930.jpg?itok=KbBsNgk6", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:55:30", "author": "Isabelle Liew", "authors": ["Isabelle Liew"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": -0.165}

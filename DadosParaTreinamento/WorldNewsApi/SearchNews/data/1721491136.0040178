{"id": 237101468, "title": "Metropolitan Council wastewater treatment plant workers authorize strike on Monday", "text": "The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49 on Monday filed an intent-to-strike notice on behalf of 176 operators at the Metropolitan Council\u2019s nine wastewater treatment plants. The notice comes after members overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer that union officials said would have \u201cfailed to match the compensation paid even by some small cities,\u201d according to a news release. The notice legally triggers a 10-day cooling-off period before workers would strike. Negotiations with the Met Council will continue during that time. \u201cThese workers kept the water flowing and the toilets flushing for the entire Twin Cities metro area during a pandemic, at great risk to themselves and their families. They never worked from home \u2014 they stayed on the job like they always do. The Met Council spends lots of taxpayer money on many things. It\u2019s time it focused on fairly compensating critical employees who make the entire water infrastructure of the Twin Cities operate,\u201d said Jason George, Local 40 business manager. About 2.7 million people in 111 cities in the Twin Cities metro area rely on the wastewater treatment plants to clean the water that drains from toilets, showers, washing machines and more, the union said.", "summary": "The notice comes after members overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer.", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2024/06/17/metropolitan-council-wastewater-treatment-plant-workers-authorize-strike-on-monday/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/392.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:12:47", "author": "Kristi Miller", "authors": ["Kristi Miller"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.344}

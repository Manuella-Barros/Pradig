Due To Global Warming: Scientists", "body": "Extreme heat also threatens the stability of the electricity supply, which is critical to the functioning of healthcare facilities.\n\nThis year has been the hottest on record (file).\n\nWashington:\n\nDeadly heat that blanketed the United States, Mexico and Central America recently was made 35 times more likely due to global warming, an international network of climate scientists said on Thursday.\n\nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) group of scientists also said that extreme highs witnessed over that region in May and June were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago.\n\nThe record-breaking heat killed at least 125 people in Mexico and caused thousands more to suffer heat strokes, a potentially fatal condition that occurs when the body's internal cooling mechanisms start to fail.\n\n\"We likely do not know the full picture of heat-related deaths, since they are usually only confirmed and reported months after the event, if at all,\" said WWA, which uses peer-reviewed methods to assess links between specific extreme events and global warming.\n\nThey said that as the world continues to burn fossil fuels and emit climate-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, millions more people are expected to be exposed to dangerous levels of heat in the future.\n\nThis year has been the hottest on record and already large swathes of the world have endured blistering temperatures before the onset of the northern hemisphere summer.\n\nGreece has notched its earliest-ever heatwave, India has suffered a month-long stretch of searing highs, while the United States is dealing with wildfires and scorching conditions.\n\nAnd in Saudi Arabia, at least 900 people died during the annual hajj pilgrimage, mostly from unforgiving heat with temperatures in Mecca hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday.\n\n'Between life and death'\n\nFor its study, WWA analysed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a \"heat dome\" that lingered over the southwest United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June.\n\nThe scientists have pioneered ways to use climate models to understand how these types of extreme events have changed in a world that is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times.\n\nThey concluded \"that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 degrees hotter and about 35 times more likely\".\n\nWWA warned that if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still.\n\n\"The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June,\" said Karina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre.\n\n\"As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat,\" she said in a statement.\n\nHeat is the deadliest of all extreme weather but often underestimated, experts say, with children, the elderly and outdoor workers particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn Mexico and Central America, the impacts of heat are intensified by poor housing conditions, limited access to cooling services, and for those living in informal settlements.\n\nExtreme heat also threatens the stability of electricity supply, which is critical to the functioning of healthcare facilities.\n\nScientists said that extreme heat warming systems and action plans could help bolster Central America's preparedness for such events, with safety measures needed to protect outdoor workers.\n\nGreen spaces and improved infrastructure in informal settlements would also help protect the most vulnerable people, WWA added.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(Except for the headline, this

more likely due to global warming, an international network of climate scientists said on Thursday.\n\nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) group of scientists also said that extreme highs witnessed over that region in May and June were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago.\n\nThe record-breaking heat killed at least 125 people in Mexico and caused thousands more to suffer heat strokes, a potentially fatal condition that occurs when the body's internal cooling mechanisms start to fail.\n\n\"We likely do not know the full picture of heat-related deaths, since they are usually only confirmed and reported months after the event, if at all,\" said WWA, which uses peer-reviewed methods to assess links between specific extreme events and global warming.\n\nThey said that as the world continues to burn fossil fuels and emit climate-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, millions more people are expected to be exposed to dangerous levels of heat in the future.\n\nThis year has been the hottest on record and already large swathes of the world have endured blistering temperatures before the onset of the northern hemisphere summer.\n\nThe scientists have pioneered ways to use climate models to understand how these types of extreme events have changed in a world that is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times.\n\nThey concluded \"that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 degrees hotter and about 35 times more likely\".\n\nWWA warned that if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still.\n\n\"The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June,\" said Karina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre.\n\n\"As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat,\" she said in a statement.\n\nHeat is the deadliest of all extreme weather but often underestimated, experts say, with children, the elderly

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nAlso read | 68 Indians among over 500 dead due to scorching heat during Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the US state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nAlso read | Highway to 'climate hell': What breaching the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold could mean\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

more likely in US, Mexico, C....", "body": "People protect themselves from the sun during a heat wave hitting the country, in Guadalajara, Jalisco state, Mexico, in May 2024\n\nDeadly heat that blanketed the United States, Mexico and Central America recently was made 35 times more likely due to global warming, an international network of climate scientists said on Thursday.\n\nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) group of scientists also said that extreme highs witnessed over that region in May and June were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago.\n\nThe record-breaking heat killed at least 125 people in Mexico and caused thousands more to suffer heat strokes, a potentially fatal condition that occurs when the body's internal cooling mechanisms start to fail.\n\n\"We likely do not know the full picture of heat-related deaths, since they are usually only confirmed and reported months after the event, if at all,\" said WWA, which uses peer-reviewed methods to assess links between specific extreme events and global warming.\n\nThey said that as the world continues to burn fossil fuels and emit climate-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, millions more people are expected to be exposed to dangerous levels of heat in the future.\n\nEffects of heat stress on the body\n\nThis year has been the hottest on record and already large swathes of the world have endured blistering temperatures before the onset of the northern hemisphere summer.\n\nGreece has notched its earliest-ever heatwave, India has suffered a month-long stretch of searing highs, while the United States is dealing with wildfires and scorching conditions.\n\nAnd in Saudi Arabia, at least 900 people died during the annual hajj pilgrimage, mostly from unforgiving heat with temperatures in Mecca hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday.\n\n- 'Between life and death' -\n\nFor its study, WWA analysed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a \"heat dome\" that lingered over the southwest United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June.\n\nA man effected by the scorching heat is helped by a member of the Saudi security forces as Muslim pilgrims perform the symbolic 'stoning of the devil' ritual as part of the hajj pilgrimage in Mina\n\nThe scientists have pioneered ways to use climate models to understand how these types of extreme events have changed in a world that is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times.\n\nThey concluded \"that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 degrees hotter and about 35 times more likely\".\n\nWWA warned that if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still.\n\n\"The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June,\" said Karina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre.\n\n\"As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat,\" she said in a statement.\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures during a heatwave in May and June killed at least 125 people in Mexico\n\nHeat is the deadliest of all extreme weather but often underestimated, experts say, with children, the elderly and outdoor workers particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn Mexico and Central America, the impacts of heat are intensified by poor housing conditions, limited access to cooling services, and for those living in informal settlements.\n\nExtreme heat also threatens the stability of electricity supply, which is critical to the functioning of healthcare facilities.\n\nScientists said that extreme heat warming systems and action plans could help bolster Central America's preparedness for such events, with safety measures needed to protect outdoor workers.\n\nGreen spaces and improved infrastructure in informal settlements would also help protect the most vulnerable people, WWA added.", "source": {"uri":

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans.

A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nA broad swath of the eastern U.S. was also wilting for a fourth consecutive day under a heat dome, a phenomenon that occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nNew York City opened emergency cooling centres in libraries, senior centers and other facilities. While the city's schools were operating normally, a number of districts in the surrounding suburbs sent students home early to avoid the heat.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the U.S. state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nAll told, nearly 100 million Americans were under extreme heat advisories, watches and warnings on Thursday, according to the federal government's National Integrated Heat Health Information System.\n\nThe brutal temperatures should begin easing in New England on Friday, the weather service said, but New York and the mid-Atlantic states will continue to endure near-record heat into the weekend.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.

Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of about 40C this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans.

Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland.\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2C at 1am.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40C since 14 May, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between 1 March and 18 June, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult.

Organization says there is an 86 percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the U.S. state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.

REUTERS\n\nDeadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.\n\nRecord temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the Hajj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the US state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com",

REUTERS/Valdrin Xhemaj\n\nBy Gloria Dickie\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Deadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.\n\nRecord temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the U.S. state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\n(Reporting by Gloria Dickie in

Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nA woman tries to cool herself from a water mist on a hot day in Skopje, North Macedonia. AP\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat.\n\nA 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nChildren play in a city water feature during a heatwave affecting the US Northeast in Boston. Reuters\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high. Under its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centres for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5\u00b0C.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2\u00b0C at 1am.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise.\n\nIn many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40\u00b0C since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18.\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological organisation says there is an 86% per cent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2\u00b0C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki",

35x more likely in US'", "body": "(UPDATE) WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Deadly heat that blanketed the United States, Mexico and Central America recently was made 35 times more likely due to global warming, an international network of climate scientists said on Thursday.\n\nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) group of scientists also said extreme highs witnessed over that region in May and June were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago.\n\nThe record-breaking heat killed at least 125 people in Mexico and caused thousands more to suffer heat strokes, a potentially fatal condition that occurs when the body's internal cooling mechanisms start to fail.\n\n\"We likely do not know the full picture of heat-related deaths, since they are usually only confirmed and reported months after the event, if at all,\" said the WWA, which uses peer-reviewed methods to assess links between specific extreme events and global warming.\n\nThey said that as the world continues to burn fossil fuels and emit climate-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, millions more people are expected to be exposed to dangerous levels of heat in the future.\n\nGet the latest

Policy.\n\nThis year has been the hottest on record and already large swathes of the world have endured blistering temperatures before the onset of the Northern Hemisphere summer.\n\nGreece has notched its earliest-ever heat wave, India has suffered a monthlong stretch of searing highs, while the US is dealing with wildfires and scorching conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Saudi Arabia, at least 1,000 people died during the annual Hajj pilgrimage, mostly from unforgiving heat, with temperatures in the holy city of Mecca hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday.\n\n'Between life and death'\n\nFor its study, the WWA analyzed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a \"heat dome\" that lingered over the southwestern US, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June.\n\nThe scientists have pioneered ways to use climate models to understand how these types of extreme events have changed in a world that is 1.2 C warmer than in pre-industrial times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey concluded \"that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 degrees hotter and about 35 times more likely.\"\n\nThe WWA warned that if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still.\n\n\"The additional 1.4 C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June,\" Karina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at the Red Cross Climate Center, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat,\" she added.\n\nHeat is the deadliest of all extreme weather but is often underestimated, experts say, with children, the elderly and outdoor workers particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn Mexico and Central America, the impacts of heat are intensified by poor housing conditions, limited access to cooling services, and for those living in informal settlements.\n\nExtreme heat also threatens the stability of electricity supply, which is critical to the functioning of health care facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists said that extreme heat warming systems and action plans could help bolster Central America's preparedness for such events, with safety measures needed to protect outdoor workers.\n\nGreen spaces and improved infrastructure in informal settlements would also help protect the most vulnerable people, the WWA said.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@manilatimes.net", "name": "Agence

Record-breaking temperatures have resulted in numerous fatalities, with instances reported across Asia, Europe, and the U.S. Scientists warn that such extreme heat events will become more frequent and intense.\n\nDeadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years. Record temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities. Egyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory. In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions. In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week. Parts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high. Under its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the U.S. state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F). In the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland. COUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat. But New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter. New Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells. Gaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES The heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record. While overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. Scientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 C (104 F) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of the U.S. state of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn the nearby state of New Mexico, a pair of fast-moving wildfires abetted by the blistering heat have killed two people, burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed 500 homes, according to authorities. Heavy rains could help temper the blazes, but thunderstorms on Thursday were also causing flash flooding and complicating firefighting efforts.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on Thursday near the Mexican city of Tampico and was responsible for three deaths, all children. The weakening storm was expected to bring flooding to northeastern Mexico and the Texas coastline as it moves inland.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\n(Reporting by Gloria Dickie in

They said that as the world continues to burn fossil fuels and emit climate-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, millions more people are expected to be exposed to dangerous levels of heat in the future.\n\nThis year has been the hottest on record and already large swathes of the world have endured blistering temperatures before the onset of the northern hemisphere summer. Greece has notched its earliest-ever heatwave, India has suffered a month-long stretch of searing highs, while the United States is dealing with wildfires and scorching conditions.\n\n'Between life and death'\n\nFor its study, WWA analyzed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a \"heat dome\" that lingered over the southwest United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June.\n\nThe scientists have pioneered ways to use climate models to understand how these types of extreme events have changed in a world that is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times.\n\nThey concluded \"that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 degrees hotter and about 35 times more likely\". WWA warned that if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still.\n\n\"The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June,\" said Karina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre. \"As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat,\" she said in a statement. Heat is the deadliest of all extreme weather but often underestimated, experts say, with children, the elderly and outdoor workers particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn Mexico and Central America, the impacts of heat are intensified by poor housing conditions, limited access to cooling services, and for those living in informal settlements. Extreme heat also threatens the stability of electricity supply, which is critical to the functioning of healthcare facilities.\n\nScientists said that extreme heat warming systems and action plans could help bolster Central America's preparedness for such events, with safety measures needed to protect outdoor workers. Green spaces and improved infrastructure in informal settlements would also help protect the most vulnerable people, WWA added. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news",

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighboring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 degrees Celsius since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian Health Ministry said Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heat wave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heat waves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nThe heat waves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heat waves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heat wave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heat waves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, heat waves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 degrees Celsius hotter, according to the WWA.", "source":

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 C (124 F), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.my", "dataType": "news",

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 C (124 F), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nMaximize\n\nItem 1 of 6 A man covers his face using a cloth to shield himself from the sun as he inspects railway tracks during a hot summer day in New Delhi, India, June 18, 2024.

In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than daysNew Tab, opens new tab, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F)New Tab, opens new tab above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\nReporting by Gloria Dickie in London; additional reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic in Belgrade, Pesha Magid in Riyadh, Shivam Patel in Delhi, Ahmed Mohamed Hassan in Cairo and Ali Withers in Copenhagen; editing by Mark Heinrich\n\nGloria Dickie\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nGloria Dickie reports on climate and environmental issues for Reuters.

Record temperatures are suspected to have caused numerous deaths across Asia and Europe. Meteorological forecasts indicate more extreme heat across various regions, intensifying the global climate crisis.\n\nDeadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years. Record temperatures already reached in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds if not thousands of deaths across Asia and Europe.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 C (124 F), according to reports from foreign authorities. Egyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory. In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions. In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week. Parts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high. Under its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F). COUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat. But New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter. New Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells. Gaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES The heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record. While overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group. Scientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degree Celcius, according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.\n\nIn Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40\u00baC this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday -- the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2\u00baC at 1 am.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 38 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40\u00baC since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86 per cent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3\u00baC above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks -- making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2\u00baC warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2\u00baC of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6\u00baC hotter, according to the WWA. -- Reuters\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\n2. 86 per cent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\n3.

In May and early June, the heat dome hovered over the region, breaking multiple daily and national records, and causing widespread misery and disruption, especially among the poorest and most marginalized communities.\n\nSuch extreme heat spells are four times more likely today than they were at the turn of the millennium, when the planet was 0.5C cooler, the WWA analysis found.\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, heatwaves are getting deadlier ... we've known about the dangers of climate change at least since the 1970s. But thanks to spineless politicians, who give in to fossil-fuel lobbying again and again, the world continues to burn huge amounts of oil, gas and coal,\" said Friederike Otto, co-author of the study and senior lecturer in climate science at Grantham Institute, at Imperial College London.\n\nAccording to the study, without meaningful political action to stop fossil fuels, deadly heatwaves will be \"very common in a 2C world\".\n\nExtreme heat increases the rates of cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases, as well as threatening to overwhelm power supplies, healthcare facilities and other infrastructure.\n\nAt least 125 people died and thousands more have suffered heatstroke in Mexico since March, where the temperature hit almost 52C on 13 June - the hottest June day ever recorded in the country. The extreme heat exacerbated severe drought and air pollution in Mexico, stoking power outages, water shortages, thousands of wildfires, and a mass die-off of endangered monkeys and birds. The actual mortality and morbidity toll is still unknown.\n\nIn Phoenix, the hottest major city in the US, 72 suspected heat deaths were under investigation by the Maricopa county medical examiner's office by 8 June - a 18% rise on the same period last year. Across the southwest US, more than 34 million people were under heat warnings and dozens have suffered heat exhaustion at political rallies.\n\nIn Guatemala's dry corridor, the hottest and driest part of the country where most people eke out a living from back-breaking farm work, schools were shuttered as temperatures hit 45C, and some of the region's poorest communities faced crop failures and severe water shortages.\n\nIn Honduras, electricity has been rationed, and smoke from uncontrolled forest fires contributed to the worst air quality ever recorded in the capital Tegucigalpa.\n\nThe death toll from across Central America, one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to the effects of the climate crisis due to its geography, high levels of poverty and inequality, poor infrastructure and governance, and a lack of heat warning systems, is unknown.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, the deadliest form of extreme weather, has been increasing in recent years due to the climate crisis, which is caused by burning fossil fuels and by other human activities such as deforestation and industrialized agriculture.\n\nThis year's May was the hottest May on record globally - and the 13th consecutive month a hottest month record was broken.\n\nTo quantify the effect of human-caused warming on the recent extreme temperatures across North and Central America, a team of international scientists analysed weather data and climate models using peer-reviewed methods to compare how these types of events have changed between today's climate, with approximately 1.2\u00b0C of global warming, and the cooler pre-industrial climate.\n\nThe WWA researchers looked at the five-day maximum temperatures across North and Central America in May and June. The analysis found that the climate crisis made the excessive heat spell about 1.4C hotter during the day - and 35 times more likely than in pre-industrial times.\n\nThe effect on night temperatures is even stronger, with the analysis finding temperatures about 1.6C hotter - a 200-fold increase due to global heating. Hot nights are particularly dangerous for human health, as the impact of heat is cumulative and the body only begins to rest and recover when temperatures drop below 80F (27C).\n\nIf fossil fuels are not phased out, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will continue to rise, leading to more deaths, illness, economic losses, hunger, water shortages and forced migration among the world's worst affected communities - who have contributed least to the climate crisis.\n\n\"As long as humans fill the atmosphere with fossil-fuel emissions, the heat will only get worse - vulnerable people will continue to die and the cost of living will continue to increase,\" said Izidine Pinto, co-author and researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n\nYet so much damage to the planet has already been done that heat-related deaths and disruption will continue to rise unless local and national governments rethink a every aspect of life including urban planning, water conservation, shade, school sports and outdoor worker protections.\n\nKarina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre, and a co-author of the study, said: \"Every fraction of a degree of warming exposes more people to dangerous heat ... As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 C (124 F), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj -- up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nIran's ISNA news agency said on Thursday that 14 Iranians have died during the haj, with six deaths attributed to heat.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 37 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\n(Reporting by Gloria Dickie in

Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F).\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 C (124 F), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj -- up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nIran's ISNA news agency said on Thursday that 14 Iranians have died during the haj, with six deaths attributed to heat.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 37 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.", "source": {"uri":

WWA is a collaboration of scientists and analysts including some from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nHeatwaves began in March across parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras and the southwest of the United States. Looking specifically at the hottest five days and nights of the most recent extreme heat in early June, the WWA scientists and analysts found that in a world which had not been heated by the 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming seen to date, the extreme heat would have been very unlikely to have happened. It was made 35 times more likely than it would have been in pre-industrial times, and four times more likely than at the start of this century, just 24 years ago. The researchers say that similar heatwaves would have been expected once every 60 years in the year 2000 but can be expected every 15 years today. The heatwaves aren't just getting more frequent.\n\nThey are getting hotter. For the five hottest days (3-7 June) and nights (5-9 June) they studied, the researchers found daytime temperatures were 1.4 degrees higher than they would have been even in an (extremely rare) 'heatwave' in pre-industrial times; night-time temperatures were 1.6 degrees more. As the world warms beyond 1.2 degrees on average, heatwaves in the region will continue to get hotter and even more frequent.\n\nThe extreme heat has had many impacts. At least 125 people in Mexico have died because of heatwaves since March. The number across the region as a whole is likely to be much higher as heat-related deaths are rarely recorded appropriately, or not captured at all, because heat-related fatalities are often attributed to preexisting or sudden-onset health conditions rather than the heat that exacerbates or causes them. One health problem that may be worsened by the heat and other climate-related disasters such as droughts, is mosquito-borne dengue fever. In Guatemala and Honduras, the exponential growth of dengue has forced health officials to declare a red alert. Figures from the Pan American Health Organization show that from 1 January to 25 May this year, cases increased by 622% in Guatemala and 580% in Honduras, in comparison to the same period in 2023.\n\nIn Guatemala, cases went from 3,738 in 2023 to 23,268 in 2024, while in Honduras they went from 4,452 to 25,859. In nearby Belize, the heatwaves have led to fires. There have been forest fires in the Toledo and Cayo districts with daily temperatures above 100\u00b0 F (39\u00b0C) creating conditions for fires to start easily and intensify swiftly. Across Central America, National Red Cross Societies are dealing with the impacts of extreme heat. In Guatemala and Honduras, volunteers are eliminating mosquito breeding sites, conducting prevention awareness campaigns and providing mosquito nets.\n\nTheir operations are supported by financial allocations from the IFRC's Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) and they aim to support more than 20,000 people. A DREF allocation is also helping the Belize Red Cross to support 800 people, providing affected families with hygiene kits, cleaning supplies and cash for recovery efforts.\n\nAdditionally, members of the national relief corps in Belize are receiving personal protection equipment. Karina Izquierdo, Urban Advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at the Red Cross Climate Centre, said: \"Every fraction of a degree of warming exposes more people to dangerous heat.\n\nThe additional 1.4\u00b0C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June. As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take bolder steps to become more resilient to heat.\" Martha Keays, IFRC Regional Director for the Americas, said: \"Extreme heat is a silent threat to the health, economy, and well-being of millions of people in Central and North America. More heatwaves are expected this year and young children, people with disabilities, pregnant women and older adults are particularly vulnerable, as are certain populations who work or spend time outdoors, such as agricultural workers and people on the move. Red Cross teams in the field will continue to assist them, while reinforcing early action and early warning initiatives that help anticipate and protect lives from this and other climate-related disasters.\" For more information, see the full report on World Weather Attribution's website here\n\nFor more information or to request an interview, please contact: media@ifrc.org In Panama: Susana

A heat dome occurs when a strong high-pressure system traps hot air over an area, preventing cooler air from entering and keeping ground temperatures high.\n\nNew York City, under its heat emergency plan, has announced the opening of cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nNew Delhi, India's capital, recorded its hottest night in 55 years on Wednesday, with the Safdarjung Observatory registering a temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius. Typically, temperatures drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nighttime temperatures are increasing faster than daytime temperatures, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nScientists warn that heatwaves will continue to intensify if global emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels are not curbed. According to the World Weather Attribution group, a collective of scientists studying the link between natural phenomena and climate change, if global temperatures rise by two degrees Celsius above

Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.\n\nIn neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week.\n\nParts of the US. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert today, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nUnder its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centres for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, today, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 degrees Celsius,\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius, according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj - up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing.\n\nIran's ISNA news agency said today that 14 Iranians have died during the haj, with six deaths attributed to heat.\n\nCounting the dead\n\nIndia's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi yesterday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius at 1 a.m.\n\nTemperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 37 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 degrees Celsius ince May 14, according to weather department data.\n\nAn official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nRecord warm temperatures\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86 per cent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting.\n\nOn average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIf the world hits 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 degrees Celsius hotter, according to the WWA. -- Reuters", "source":

The heatwave that began in May and continues to affect day to day life in the central and eastern states of the US has already killed many others in Mexico. According to the scientists, this was made 35 times more likely because of anthropogenic factors causing climate change. Human induced activities such as burning of fossil fuels has caused this issue. In neighboring Mexico, this heatwave has already killed 125 people and led to thousands of heatstroke cases. There is bad news as this heatwave like conditions will only intensify if human induced activities do not reduce, according to scientists. This study was conducted by World Weather Attribution which is an international collaboration of scientists who study climate change.\n\nRecord high temperatures:It was found that record breaking temperatures were being recorded frequently in the US, Mexico and Central America due to climate change. The study focused on the South-West USA and Mexico as well as Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras where temperatures were also extreme. This heat has not been confined to the US and North America alone, the month of May was the hottest globally among all years. Temperatures across the globe are increasingly having disastrous consequences for the planet affecting health of individuals, agricultural systems, increasing sea levels and melting glaciers.\n\nWhat is a heat dome?\n\nHeat dome has played a major role in the heat waves that have occurred. Heat domes occur when hot air is trapped close to the ground and it is further heated under the blue skies and sunshine. The report by World Weather Attribution has noted that the areas which experienced heat wave like conditions were under heat domes. The study also noted that heat waves such as the one which was experienced is four times more likely to occur today than it was in the year 2000. Since 2000, temperatures have increased by 1.4 degrees.\n\nWhat is the urban heat island effect?\n\nThis is a concept wherein urban centers experience higher temperatures than country side. This is due to the various construction activities, high rise buildings and higher emission rates in cities that increase temperatures as compared to the rural areas.\n\nWhat is the Paris deal?\n\nIt was signed in 2015 to keep the global temperatures under check. 194 parties agreed to prevent the rise of global temperature by more than 2 degrees from the pre-industrial level.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Weather_Attribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Weather Attribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belize"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban heat island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glacier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111148005,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-85250,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666993", "eventUri": "eng-9666993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The scientists emphasized that the extreme weather causing the death and suffering was brought about by fossil fuel emissions.\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, heatwaves are getting deadlier,\" Friederike Otto, a co-author of the study and climate scientist at Imperial College London, toldThe Guardian. \"We've known about the dangers of climate change at least since the 1970s. But thanks to spineless politicians, who give in to fossil-fuel lobbying again and again, the world continues to burn huge amounts of oil, gas, and coal.\"\n\nThe analysis was published on the same day that the Energy Institute reported that fossil fuel consumption climbed to a record high in 2023, with coal, oil, and gas still making up more than 80% of the global energy mix, though the figure fell below 70% in Europe for the first time.\n\nMay was the 12th consecutive month that was the hottest on record globally, compared to the same time period in previous years. And June has proved to be dangerously hot in many areas, with hundreds dying in the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as temperatures rose above 124\u00b0F and Balkan countries, as well as much of the U.S., currently under extreme heat advisories.\n\nThe WWA scientists sought to connect the May-June heatwave to these larger trends, and repeatedly explained the cause of the problem.\n\n\"As long as humans fill the atmosphere with fossil-fuel emissions, the heat will only get worse -- vulnerable people will continue to die and the cost of living will continue to increase,\" Izidine Pinto, a co-author and researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, told The Guardian.\n\nThe heatwave coincided with a drought in Mexico, exacerbating already dire conditions as water supplies dwindled and electricity systems faltered. It also followed, and may have helped prolong, a terrible outbreak of dengue in Latin America and the Caribbean that caused over 1,800 deaths. \"Every heatwave is a push that builds up dengue transmission,\" an expert toldScientific American in April. Dengue cases have begun to decline but still persist, according toDialogue Earth.\n\nThe May-June heatwave was notable for especially high nighttime temperatures, which prevent the body from resting and recovering from the daytime heat -- a process that's only possible below about 80\u00b0F. Certain places in the study area saw nighttime temperatures \"with return periods of up to 1000 years.\"\n\nThe climate crisis is changing the likelihood of such weather. \"The extreme heat slamming the eastern U.S. this week may be a sign of things to come,\" The Hill's Zach Budryk wrote Thursday.\n\nThat was similar to the message of the WWA scientists.\n\n\"These trends will continue with future warming and events like the one observed in 2024 will be very common in a 2\u00b0C world,\" according to their analysis, which refers to a time when the planet has heated 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels; it's already heated up by more than 1\u00b0C.\n\nIn the analysis, the authors called for warning systems, action plans, laws to protect outdoor workers, and other resilience measures such as better grid systems and more green spaces.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Record-breaking temperatures driven by climate change have caused health emergencies, forest fires, and numerous deaths. Major regions impacted include Europe, the U.S., the Middle East, and India. Scientists predict more intense heatwaves if global warming continues.\n\nDangerous heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again bring about record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.\n\nCountries around the Mediterranean have endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory. In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.\n\nBelgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions. In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.\n\nEurope this year has been contending with a spate of dead and missing tourists amid dangerous heat. A 55-year-old American was found dead on the Greek island of Mathraki, police said on Monday - the third such tourist death in a week. Parts of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high. Under its heat emergency plan, New York City said it would open its cooling centers for the first time this year.\n\nMeteorological authorities also issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Arizona, including Phoenix, on Thursday, with temperatures expected to reach 45.5 C (114 F). In Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 C (124 F), according to reports from foreign authorities.\n\nEgyptian medical and security sources told Reuters on Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians had died while participating in the haj -- up from 307 reported as of yesterday. Another 40 remain missing. Iran's ISNA news agency said on Thursday that 14 Iranians have died during the haj, with six deaths attributed to heat.\n\nCOUNTING THE DEAD India's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat.\n\nBut New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C (95.4 F) at 1 a.m. Temperatures normally drop at night, but scientists say climate change is causing nighttime temperatures to rise. In many parts of the world, nights are warming faster than days, according to a 2020 study by the University of Exeter.\n\nNew Delhi has clocked 37 consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 40 C (104 F) since May 14, according to weather department data. An official at the Indian health ministry said on Wednesday there were more than 40,000 suspected heatstroke cases and at least 110 confirmed deaths between March 1 and June 18, when northwest and eastern India recorded twice the usual number of heatwave days in one of the country's longest such spells.\n\nGaining accurate death tolls from heatwaves, however, is difficult. Most health authorities do not attribute deaths to heat, but rather the illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures, such as cardiovascular issues. Authorities therefore undercount heat-related deaths by a significant margin - typically overlooking thousands if not tens of thousands of deaths. RECORD WARM TEMPERATURES\n\nThe heatwaves are occurring against a backdrop of 12 consecutive months that have ranked as the warmest on record in year-on-year comparisons, according to the European Union's climate change monitoring service. The World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% percent chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nWhile overall global temperatures have risen by nearly 1.3 C (2.3 F) above pre-industrial levels, climate change is fuelling more extreme temperature peaks - making heatwaves more common, more intense and longer-lasting. On average globally, a heatwave that would have occurred once in 10 years in the pre-industrial climate will now occur 2.8 times over 10 years, and it will be 1.2 C warmer, according to an international team of scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.\n\nScientists say heatwaves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. If the world hits 2 C (3.6 F) of global warming, heatwaves would on average occur 5.6 times in 10 years and be 2.6 C (4.7 F) hotter, according to the WWA.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

The excessive temperatures were exacerbated by feedback loops caused by an ongoing drought, particularly in Mexico, and warmer ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean.\n\n\"This essentially is the same dome of high pressure that started over Central America, ballooned to the Southwest, and now is over the Eastern side of the U.S.,\" said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist and weather and climate engagement specialist with Climate Central, a climate communications nonprofit.\n\nThis level of heat used to be a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence back in 2000, but with the amount of warming that has happened since then, the average person could experience such an event five or six times in their life.\n\nHeat across the region included in the report caused wildfires, power outages, and a mass die-off of endangered monkeys. Dangerous temperatures in Mexico have caused at least 125 deaths since March, according to the study, along with more than 2,300 cases of heatstroke.\n\nThe report was released after Mexico recorded its hottest day ever, when temperatures peaked at 125 degrees Fahrenheit in the Sonoran Desert. Temperature records were also broken in Guatemala and Honduras, along with Mexico City, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Death Valley in California.\n\n\"Heat deaths are often underestimated,\" said Karina Izquierdo, the urban adviser for Latin America and the Caribbean from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center and a contributor to the report.\n\nHeat-related deaths tend to be confirmed months after the heat event, if they are reported at all. Yet heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer, and dozens of environmental and labor groups are pushing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare heat a major disaster.\n\nSome of the groups at greatest risk include agricultural laborers, construction workers, and street vendors who face direct exposure, Izquierdo said, along with unhoused people, pregnant people, young children, and older adults.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc",

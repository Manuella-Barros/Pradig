Speaking ahead of his team's clash against Chelsea on Tuesday, Arteta said (via Arseblog):\n\n\"Has he fulfilled his potential? Hopefully not. Hopefully there is still more to come. He's still very young and he's made huge steps in the last few seasons. He's got a massive role at the club and hopefully, we can keep growing.\"\n\nSo far in his Arsenal career, Odegaard has made 149 appearances across competitions, bagging 35 goals and 23 assists.

One of the biggest was bringing Martin Odegaard to the Emirates Stadium in 2021.\n\nThe Norwegian had been on loan in north London in 2020/21 before returning to Real Madrid. But Arsenal went back to sign him permanently that summer, following a succecssful loan spell.\n\nAnd it has been a decision that has been more than vindicated since then. Odegaard has become the Gunners' club captain and guided them to second place in the Premier League last year, with another title challenge on the cards this season.\n\nArsenal lead Liverpool by three points at the top of the table, with Manchester City a further point behind. The Reds and the Citizens do have one game and two games in hand, however, making it an interesting final month of the campaign to come.\n\nOdegaard was at his influential best as the Gunners thrashed Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday night, laying on two assists. That took his tally to eight for the season so far, with eight goals too - a total of 16 goal involvements.\n\nOne other player Arsenal were llinked to signing in 2021 was James Maddison, now at arch rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Leicester City had placed a \u00a360million price tag on Maddison's shoulders, whereas Odegaard cost \u00a330million in the end.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal have two hidden North London Derby motivations vs Tottenham in Premier League title race\n\nREAD MORE: Thomas Partey makes Arsenal title demand and sends Tottenham warning ahead of clash\n\nSpurs would go on to snap up Maddison for \u00a340million this summer and he has performed well for the Lilywhites. However, he has seven assists and four goals to his name this season, less than Odegaard now.\n\nThere is another player Arsenal signed that has moved into the same ball park as Maddison too. Declan Rice joined the Gunners in a British record \u00a3105million transfer from West Ham in the summer and moved to seven assists for the season with one against Chelsea. He also has six goals this season.\n\nArsenal spent a combined \u00a3135million on Odegaard and Rice, having turned down the chance to sign Maddison for \u00a360million. Some Gunners supporters were up in arms over the decision not to sign Maddison back in 2021, but Edu and Mikel Arteta have certainly been proven right with Odegaard and Rice.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_wilmot@football.london", "name": "Lee Wilmot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Maddison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Maddison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Partey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Partey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article27819031.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1709877412.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511780", "eventUri": "eng-9511780", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

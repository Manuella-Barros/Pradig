What measures is the state government implementing to safeguard lives and property in these areas? In our recent meeting with NEMA, the Kwara State Government discussed a range of solutions to mitigate flooding risks. These include constructing dykes and levees, frequent dredging of waterways, building buffers, and initiating afforestation projects. As part of our proactive measures, the government has issued early warnings to communities in flood-prone areas. We recognise. We the importance of timely information in reducing of potential floods. Furthermore, various sectors, including agriculture, food security, education, health, transportation, and security, are actively working on disaster preparedness and risk reduction strategies. These collaborative efforts are essential in creating a comprehensive approach to flood management. The government is committed to implementing the best measures to control floods and protect communities. We are dedicated to safeguarding the interests of Kwarans and ensuring their safety to the fullest extent possible. What specific measures has the Kwara State government implemented to mitigate flood risks in the identified areas and across the state? We are making every effort to ensure that no one is caught unawares by potential flooding. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve issued timely alerts through relevant government agencies. As a democratic government, we rely on the people\u2019s cooperation to effectively mitigate flood risks. Regular monitoring is conducted to prevent refuse dumping in waterways. However, we need everyone\u2019s help in this effort. Please clear your drainage to allow the free flow of water as a precaution. Resettling communities along riverbanks to prevent the loss of lives and properties is also one of our viable options. We will continue to advocate for awareness about the dangers of flooding and living near rivers. While we can\u2019t control the rainfall, we are committed to doing our best to safeguard our citizens. With local government elections scheduled for September 2024 in Kwara State, what measures is the government implementing to ensure fairness and transparency in the electoral process? Kwara State is fully prepared for the upcoming local government elections. However, the election will be conducted by the Kwara State Independent Electoral Commission, and His Excellency, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, will not interfere in the activities of this independent body. We are confident that KWASIEC will ensure a smooth and peaceful process that will make the election free and fair. Can you provide more details on the new NG-CARES portal for MSMEs launched by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq\u2019s administration? The NG-CARES (Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus) programme was launched by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq\u2019s administration. It aims to support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Kwara State through the disbursement of grants to businesses with physical addresses. This programme demonstrates the administration\u2019s commitment to supporting small businesses and promoting economic growth in Kwara State. The NG-CARES programme is now open for the third phase of applications and the disbursement of operational support grants for existing businesses. The requirements to apply for the grant include Evidence of business existence (photos); Rent receipts; Utility bills and Staff salary evidence. This initiative ensures that MSMEs in Kwara State receive the necessary financial support to sustain and grow their operations, further driving economic development in the state. How are residents positioned to benefit from this? Residents of Kwara State stand to gain significantly from the NG-CARES programme for MSMEs. Eligible businesses can receive financial support aimed at sustaining and growing their operations, which will, in turn, contribute to the state\u2019s economic growth. This financial backing is crucial for building resilience among MSMEs, enabling them to create jobs, stimulate local economies, and play a vital role in the state\u2019s overall development. The programme is designed to ensure inclusive access for business owners across the 16 local government areas in Kwara State. The application process requires evidence of the business\u2019s existence, such as a photo of the business taken with the owner, shop rent receipts (if applicable), utility bills (if applicable), evidence of staff salary payments or payroll (if applicable), and a Business Registration Certificate (if applicable). This comprehensive approach ensures equal opportunities for all eligible nano, micro, and small-scale businesses.

This initiative not only provides immediate financial relief but also contributes to the long-term economic stability and growth of Kwara State. There has been a surge in cultist-related clashes in Kwara State recently. What is responsible for this menace? We are actively working hand in hand with all concerned agencies to curb the spread of cultism in our state. However, our investigation of past cases has pointed out peer pressure, substance abuse, desperation, and a decline in morality as the root causes of involvement in cultism and cult clashes. But, as I said earlier, the state is working tenaciously to put a stop to this menace. What measures have been instituted by the Kwara State government to address the spread of cultism and ensure residents can live peacefully? To address the issue of cultism and ensure residents can live peacefully, the Kwara State government has implemented a series of measures, including routine security checks, youth empowerment programmes, and sensitisation initiatives. Recently, His Excellency, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, spoke at the Stakeholders\u2019 Dialogue on Stemming Social Vices among Students, emphasising the importance of proactive engagement with youth. His Excellency has also embarked on several projects aimed at keeping the youth engaged and productive. These projects include the Ilorin Innovation Hub, Sugar Film Factory, Garment Factory, Visual Arts Centre, and a recreational facility, Flower Garden. These initiatives are designed to provide opportunities for skill development, creativity, and recreation, thereby diverting young people from negative influences and activities. The government is committed to guiding young minds positively rather than judging or castigating them. We believe in maintaining order in our society by providing proper guidance and support to our youth. In addition to the government\u2019s efforts, we have also advised parents to play their part in guiding their wards, especially regarding the use of social media, to prevent them from being wrongly exposed to harmful content. The state government remains dedicated to youth development and will continue to groom them for a better future. Kwara State, known as the State of Harmony, is committed to ensuring tranquillity in every part of our state, fostering an environment where residents can live peacefully and thrive. Away from the state government, you are a public relations, marketing, and communications professional. What motivated you to join politics? I was inspired to join politics after years of observing the disconnect between policymakers and the communities they serve. I realised my skills in effective communication, stakeholder engagement, and issues management could be leveraged to bridge this gap and create a meaningful impact. How do you carry your family along with your political career, or do you not involve them? I prefer to keep my family private. However, I am a proud mother of four children and a wife to a great man. Are there new perspectives on life that you have experienced in politics and governance? Politics has been a humbling experience. The realities of governance are far more intricate and complex, demanding compromise and a deep understanding of diverse viewpoints. Witnessing the passion of the people is a constant reminder that real change comes from everyone, the leaders and the people we serve. Every decision carries immense weight, affecting millions of lives, and this has instilled in me a profound sense of responsibility and a commitment to lead with empathy and reason. Do you think there is enough representation of women and youth in the politics and governance of this country? No, I believe the current level of women and youth participation in Nigerian politics is low. Our nation boasts a vibrant young population and talented women who are vastly underrepresented in decision-making roles. This disenfranchisement not only silences a significant portion of our society but also hinders our progress. Young people bring innovative ideas and a different perspective to tackle longstanding issues. Women offer diverse viewpoints that can enrich policymaking. When our leaders reflect the demographics of the nation, it fosters a stronger connection and trust between the people and the government. We are missing out on a wealth of talent and potential by not creating opportunities for women and youth to participate. Among the states in the country, only Kwara State has given more appointments to women and youths in Nigeria. As a matter of fact, 50 per cent of the Kwara State cabinet are women, and there are many women in other leadership positions in the state. This has earned His Excellency the He-for-She title, demonstrating our commitment to gender equality and youth inclusion in governance. If every Governor in Nigeria emulates His Excellency, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq\u2019s zeal for inclusive governance, I have no doubt women and youth will be well represented in the decision-making process. Many Nigerian youths are displeased with the APC over unemployment, rising inflation, and insecurity among other issues, and the ruling party keeps asking for their patience. Is this justified? The concerns expressed by Nigerian youths regarding issues like unemployment, rising inflation, and insecurity are understandable. These challenges affect our daily lives and aspirations, and it\u2019s crucial that they are addressed with urgency and effectiveness. The APC government acknowledges these difficulties and empathises with the frustrations felt by our youth. While immediate solutions to these multifaceted issues require time and concerted effort, it\u2019s important to note that the government is actively working to implement policies and initiatives aimed at tackling unemployment, stabilising the economy, and enhancing security across the country. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to create a conducive environment for economic growth and social stability. We urge our youth to remain patient and resilient as we navigate these challenges together. The APC government remains committed to fulfilling its mandate of improving the lives of all Nigerians, especially our vibrant and dynamic youth population. With continued collaboration and support from all stakeholders, we are confident that we can overcome these challenges and build a prosperous future for our nation.", "summary": "<p>The Commissioner for Communications in Kwara State, Mrs Bolanle Olukoju, speaks with BIODUN BUSARI on the state government&#8217;s efforts to curb flooding, initiatives to support small business owners and other pertinent issues The National Emergency Management Agency has recently identified five local government areas in Kwara State as being at high to moderate risk of </p>\n <br/> <a href='https://punchng.com/nigerians-should-be-patient-with-apc-kwara-commissioner/'>Read More</a>", "url": "https://punchng.com/nigerians-should-be-patient-with-apc-kwara-commissioner/", "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/28215843/Mrs-Bolanle-Olukoju.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:03:25", "author": "Our Reporters", "authors": ["Our Reporters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.067}

marked the 11th anniversary of Israel's defeat in its onslaught against Lebanon, Nasrallah noted that the main reason behind victory of Hezbollah fighters was their patience, steadfastness, valor and faith.\n\nStressing the rise in Hezbollah's power since the war in 2006, Nasrallah noted that the resistance group was ready to face any more act of aggression, warning that in case of new Israeli aggression, it will face a 100-times harder response that its forces saw during the 2006 war.\n\nNasrallah added that Israelis analysts are still analyzing the results of that war, because it perished their self-confidence and they have admitted to their defeat in the summer war in 2006.\n\nEverything that Israelis say about the power of Hezbollah is because of their defeat in summer 2006 war, Nasrallah said.\n\nThe Hezbollah chief stated that Israelis wanted to destroy Hezbollah, but after 11 years, they say Hezbollah has become stronger and more powerful and this shows that they have failed to achieve the goals they pursued through 2006 war.\n\nElsewhere in his speech, Nasrallah explained that Hezbollah only fights outside the Lebanese borders and will not use force in domestic developments of the country.\n\nHe added that in return for its victories, Hezbollah does not seek personal, party, or tribal interests, noting that today, the resistance movement is more powerful than ever and the enemy had reached the conclusion that any new aggression against Lebanon will be very costly.\n\nRejecting any chance of a new Israeli aggression against Lebanon, Nasrallah noted that the time for playing with Lebanon is over and Israelis themselves have owned up to high cost of such a war and have said that war with Lebanon should not take place.\n\nThey wanted to crush the resistance in 2006 war, but they failed to achieve this goal, Nasrallah said.\n\nThe Hezbollah chief added that not only Israel, but all those parties, which seek to crush Hezbollah at the present time will fail to achieve this goal.\n\nNasrallah said that due to its inability to wage new war on Lebanon, Israel wants to collectively punish the entire Lebanese nation, and its putting high pressure on the administration of US President Donald Trump, but they will fail to achieve anything as they did in the past.\n\nAbout 1,200 Lebanese, most of them civilians, lost their lives during Israel's 33-day war on Lebanon back in the summer of 2006.\n\nAccording to the 629-page Winograd Report by the Israeli regime itself, Hezbollah fighters involved in defending Lebanon against the Israeli war defeated the enemy and Tel Aviv was compelled to withdraw without having achieved any of its objectives.\n\nUN Security Council Resolution 1701, which brokered a ceasefire in the 2006 war, calls on Israel to respect Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Lebanon-based Arabic-language al-Manar television network on Jul 14, head of Hezbollah's Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddine stated that the resistance movement will \"surprise\" Israel in any future war, relying on its enhanced military capabilities.\n\nSafieddine stressed that Hezbollah has been changing and developing new military capabilities, and Israeli reports on Hezbollah's weaponry are \"inaccurate as the enemy intelligence agencies can never reach veracious data in this context.\"", "timeCrawl": "15:40:00", "sim": 0.9058823585510254, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2943, "date": "2017-07-14", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2949}],

The Hebrew signs say \"No entrance, closed military area\" and \"Stop, border ahead\". (Johnny Zoo/CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nIsrael does not want Hezbollah to have an effective deterrent capability in the event it wages another war against the civilian population of Lebanon.\n\nIsrael does not want Hezbollah to have an effective deterrent capability in the event it goes to war against the group in Lebanon.\n\nIf anyone thinks Israel's recent warnings about not being able to tolerate the reported establishment of Iranian-built Hezbollah armament factories in Lebanon increases the probability of an imminent war, they couldn't be more wrong.\n\nHowever, mighty Israel is certainly not bluffing when it makes a point of drawing strict red lines on the need to deprive the Islamic resistance movement of advanced weaponry in an effort to minimize the destruction it could inflict on them in the event of another war.\n\nAfter all, it has repeatedly struck suspected weapon storages of advanced Iranian arms near Damascus airport and intercepted maritime efforts in the same regard.\n\nYet the irony is that for all the repeated warnings from a state that has a \"qualitative military edge\" against her non-state adversary in every conceivable aspect, nuclear-armed Israel appears to have strained itself at the leash by limiting its reaction to words and not bombs.\n\nIsrael has long invested significant resources into producing a detailed matrix covering the potential avenues by which Hezbollah is accumulating advanced weaponry - other than the assumed Iranian planeloads through Damascus airport and generous stockpiles bequeathed to them from the Syrian Armed Forces.\n\nSince the onset of the Syrian civil war, it has been hypothesizing, sometimes publicly, about the additional possibilities as to how Hezbollah is likely arming itself and has been adamant it must be through air shipments.\n\nIt began with accusing Iran of hiding deliveries of armaments in regular commercial cargo at Beirut airport whose security is headed by a nominee of Hezbollah - but to no avail.\n\nThen it conjured up the idea that perhaps Iran was making circular overflights between Syrian airbases and Lebanon's Bekaa Valley with small military aircraft that had their transponders deceptively switched off in order to outsmart flight trackers.\n\nThe hypothesis was that perhaps these small aircraft were parachuting small crates of weapons at predetermined coordinates in some sophisticated manner that are in turn audaciously collected by Hezbollah operatives in the dead of the night.\n\nBut they appeared to have quietly abandoned the idea upon failing to convince anyone of its realistic possibility.\n\nHezbollah's resort to a domestic arms industry with the blessing of Iran's spiritual leadership, to which it holds ultimate authority, dates back in one way or another to the 1990s.\n\nIt is not part of a military-industrial complex.\n\nThe funding, material acquisition, research, preparation and usage of end products remain confined to, and for the sole use of, Hezbollah as a movement.\n\nA rich concentration of Iranian-trained engineers, scientists and technicians along with a free flow of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) resources toward military research and development has gradually facilitated the rapid expansion of Hezbollah's locally produced weapons.\n\nBesides the manufacturing of small arms, ammunition, drones, mortars, self-propelled artillery and components for anti-tank and sub-aqueous missiles, Hezbollah's main emphasis has inevitably been on developing game-changing weapons for an all-out war against Israel: crude variants of deadly long-range missiles.\n\nIt's a no-brainer that the location of these secretive facilities are most likely to be based in Hezbollah-controlled constituencies in the country in addition to dozens of research and storage sites that were at one time additionally dispersed next door in Syria.\n\nBut the logic behind this arms production is not, as is often cited, a knee-jerk reaction to Israel's 2012 destruction of a Iran's Yarmouk weapons factory in Khartoum, Sudan, repeated targeting of arms shipments in Damascus, or even a counterbalance to the increasing complexities associated with smuggling.\n\nIt was simply to provide a degree of preparedness, self-reliance and ultimately survival for the movement that was, and is, at the frontline of the Islamic-revolution inspired battle against Israel and other defined enemies.\n\nAnd by a recent display of everything from vehicle-mounted guns, bulldozers, tanks, armored personnel carriers, rapid response motorcycles and long-range artillery, you'd think that either Israel's staccato of threats to stymie Hezbollah's accumulation of weapons have either become long in the tooth or the Islamic movement has become hard of hearing.\n\nFor all the hysteria, Israel's threats over the disclosure of these armament factories have not come in a vacuum, they're part of a long-term strategy to gain international legitimacy in order to broaden its bank of disparate targets across Lebanese civilian areas in any future conflict with Hezbollah.\n\nThat movement's entrenchment in Syria and the inadvertent door that its opened to a second front from which it can attack Israel, has increased the sense of vulnerability already felt in Israeli military circles as battle-hardened Hezbollah goes from victory to victory against ISIL, its affiliates and terrorist mercenaries that are primarily backed by a consortium of regional countries.\n\nIsrael is clearly trying to make up for this by ratcheting up its on-going psychological war effort in an attempt to put a buoyant Hezbollah on the back foot, to make it aware that any war-causing provocation would unleash a threshold of military action like never before.\n\nThe only thing that currently stops it from risking military escalation to neutralize this growing threat is mutual deterrence, the knowledge that any harm Israel inflicts on Lebanon or Hezbollah will be reciprocated onto its already-vulnerable home front with a dimension of damage unseen since its creation.\n\nIt has calculated that the best it can do in the interim period, where both the Israeli public and its international backers evidently have no appetite to see another war, is to hope that the publicity gained from exposing Hezbollah's rearming and intelligence gathering efforts will one day be worth their weight in gold.\n\nIf and when war does break out, it would feel justified to 'strafe' anything in Lebanon on the premise that they've been forewarning the world for years about Hezbollah's increasing war preparations and interspersed belligerence towards the Jewish state.\n\nEven as it fails to pinpoint the location of the revealed weapon factories, the steady flow of information 'purporting' to have exposed apparent Hezbollah missile storages in civilian villages and the need to diversify its selection of targets as a corollary, remains a constant.\n\nThe only recent addition to this 'purporting' is the apparent gathering of intelligence by Hezbollah on the border under the guise of an environmental group.\n\nBut as it stands, ruling out the chances of Hezbollah making them privy to instruction manuals and assembly points for their missile production anytime soon, mighty Israel will continue to remind its benefactors that the hand of war and peace is not upon its shoulder but around its throat.", "timeCrawl": "21:50:00", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng":

The terror group Islamic State (IS) has regularly exploited the Arabic word \"sawarim\" in their propaganda movies over the last several years, according to the official.\n\nOf the 254 schools, 242 were in Delhi, four in Noida, two in Ghaziabad, and six in Gurugram, with the threat affecting thousands of kids in all four cities.

Petitioner Arpit Bhargava, a lawyer, moved the court in 2023 in the wake of a hoax bomb threat to Delhi Public School (DPS) on Mathura Road here.\n\nDuring the hearing, advocate Beenashaw Soni, appearing for the petitioner, mentioned the recent bomb threat email received by around 200 schools in the Delhi-NCR area which later turned out to be hoax.\n\nShe submitted there were only 18 bomb detection and disposal squads with the city police and wanted to know how they possibly could reach 200 schools as was the case recently.\n\n\"This time everyone was affected as every household has a kid. Schools gave a call to parents to come from their offices and pick up their children. The parents are traumatised and insecure. Are we waiting for a bomb to explode to bring these measures in line? It is like sending children to a war zone,\" she argued.\n\nDelhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi, who was also representing the Delhi Police, submitted that deployment of constabulary in each and every school with modern equipment was not possible.\n\nPolice have issued SOP and all private schools have been informed about it. The SOP includes disaster management practices and also explains bomb threat situations.\n\nAfter going through the SOPs, the court said they were general in nature and did not pertain to bomb threats to schools.\n\n\"There are certain institutions which require special treatment, for example hospitals where patients are finding it difficult to come out and schools where there are children right from nursery to 12th standard.\n\n\"What is it that you have done to ensure that children studying in schools are evacuated? Do you have any special kind of SOP to handle such a kind of problem or not?\" the court asked.\n\nIt asked which authority would be alerted first and which would be the first to respond in the event of such a threat.\n\n\"What is the time period that you are giving to yourself from the time of receipt of bomb threat to actual action taken?\" the court asked. Tripathi told the court it would not take more than 5 minutes.\n\nOn being asked about how many times mock drills have been conducted in schools, the government counsel said the exercise is conducted every three months.\n\nThe claim was disputed by the petitioner as also the judge who said, \"I don't think the information or the instruction is correct.\" The Director of Education, who was present during the hearing, said the department issues instructions to schools to conduct mock drills quarterly after which they send action taken reports.\n\nThe Directorate of Education (DoE), in a recent status report, said it has \"zero-tolerance policy\" in matters of safety in schools and its officials are doing their best to ensure effective implementation of the guidelines for dealing with disasters, including bomb threats.", "source": {"uri": "newsdrum.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsDrum"}, "authors": [{"uri": "newsdrum_desk@newsdrum.in", "name": "NewsDrum Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bomb threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dependent territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Public_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Public School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Region_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Capital Region (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/580x326/filters:format(webp)/newsdrum-in/media/media_files/HkWgEMp0X995lF8rHhsr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541914", "eventUri": "eng-9541914", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1601, "textEnd": 1607}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Alongside, the bomb disposal unit was summoned to commence a thorough investigation. While no concerning items have been uncovered thus far, authorities remain steadfast in their inquiry, underscoring the gravity with which they approach the matter.\n\nNotably, just three days prior, approximately 200 schools in the Delhi-NCR region encountered a similar ordeal, receiving threatening messages of bomb detonation.

threats in schools - Mangalorean.com", "body": "HC seeks Delhi Govt, police's plan for handling bomb threats in schools\n\nNew Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday sought a detailed response from the Delhi Government and Delhi Police regarding their preparedness and procedures for handling bomb threats in schools.\n\nJustice Subramonium Prasad was hearing a plea filed by lawyer Arpit Bhargava after a bomb threat email was received from Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, last year, which later turned out to be a prank by one of the students \"just for fun\".\n\nBhargava, who is a parent, recently also filed an application contending the lack of progress in investigating and resolving three out of five bomb threat incidents reported in schools last year.\n\nLast week, a total of 125 bomb threat complaints were received from different schools on the emergency helpline number 112 from 5.47 a.m. to 2.13 p.m..\n\nBhargava's plea contends the lack of a coordinated action plan to ensure the safety and security of schoolchildren, teachers, and staff in response to bomb threats.\n\nJustice Prasad sought information on the specific roles of nodal officers assigned to handle such threats, the number of mock drills conducted, and the preparedness measures in place across different zones.\n\nThe court has given the authorities 10 days to file an affidavit detailing their current protocols and the circulars issued on this matter over time.\n\nBhargava stressed the urgency of establishing a comprehensive action plan, criticising the current lack of specific procedures tailored to the unique environment of schools.\n\nIn court, the counsel for the Delhi Government, Santosh Kumar Tripathi, assured that the police have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for responding to both hoax and real threats, which includes immediate police notification and evacuation protocols.\n\nHowever, Justice Prasad expressed concern that these SOPs might be too generalised and not sufficiently focused on the specific needs of schools, which range from nursery to high school levels.\n\nFurther submissions revealed that while mock drills are regularly conducted, there is a pressing need for a more specialised SOP that addresses the unique vulnerabilities of educational institutions.\n\nThe court stressed the necessity of involving parents in these drills and ensuring that every school has a robust and rehearsed evacuation plan.\n\nThe matter is set to be heard next on May 16.\n\nLast week, the Directorate of Education (DoE) apprised the High Court of its \"zero-tolerance policy\" regarding safety in schools, particularly amid concerns related to bomb threats.\n\nThe DoE has submitted a status report indicating its proactive measures to ensure effective implementation of safety guidelines.\n\nAccording to the status report, it issued various directives to schools to enhance their safety and security protocols.\n\nThese include a circular dated April 16, outlining precautionary measures and delineating the roles of school authorities in handling bomb threats.\n\nThe DoE said that while it is committed to enforcing safety measures, addressing bomb threats primarily falls under the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies.\n\nNonetheless, it has taken significant steps, including convening emergent meetings to devise safety plans and issuing circulars to guide schools in conducting safety audits and preparing for potential disasters.\n\nThe report highlighted the DoE's comprehensive approach to addressing safety concerns, encompassing stakeholder consultations, expert opinions, and issuance of detailed guidelines through various circulars.\n\nMoreover, measures such as making parents aware of the consequences of hoax threat calls, conducting safety walks, and implementing mock drills for evacuation have been initiated.\n\nFurthermore, the DoE has established an online reporting mechanism for schools to regularly update their safety status.\n\nThe petitioner had cited the alarming frequency of bomb threats and stressed the need for swift and effective measures to ensure the safety of children and all stakeholders.\n\nThe latest application filed by the petitioner referenced a recent bomb threat email directed at the court itself, underscoring the urgency of the situation.\n\nThe court had earlier also impleaded various private schools' organisations as respondents to the case and issued notices to them.", "source": {"uri": "mangalorean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mangalorean.com"},

Further, the court enquired as to what steps have been taken to handle such problem in schools.\n\nThe Court directed the respondents to file an affidavit stating the number of schools present within the territory of Delhi, the response time required to reach the said spots by the police in case of a bomb threat as well as a report on whether the bomb safety drills were actually being conducted in the schools or not and if so, whom were they being supervised by.\n\nDuring the hearing, it was submitted by the concerned official from the Department of Education that there is already a requirement for schools to conduct safety drills every quarter and the same is also ensured by way of submission of ATR by the said schools.\n\nThe High Court was hearing a petition moved last year by an advocate Arpit Bhargav whose child studies in Delhi Public school. He has sought a direction for formulation of action plan and its implementation in a time bound manner due to bomb threat calls in schools in past years.\n\nThe matter was listed for filing of reply on behalf of GNCTD failing which an officer not below the rank of joint secretary from the Department of Education was directed to remain present in court.\n\nNo reply was filed on behalf of GNCTD. Adv. Beenashaw N. Soni, appeared for the Petitioner Adv. Arpit Bhargava, along with Adv. Sarthak Sharma, Adv. Pankaj Sehrawat, Adv. Abhishek Gaind, Adv. Mansi Jain, Adv. Ann Joseph, while the State was represented by Adv. Santosh Kumar Tripathi.\n\nIt was argued on behalf of the Petitioner that despite of the urgency of the case, no concrete steps are being taken by the Respondents with respect to the situation of bomb threats in schools even the orders of the High Court dated May 23, 2024 has not been complied with.\n\nAny bomb threat, whether a hoax or actual creates a situation of panic and chaos for all stakeholders including the students, school staff as well as the concerned parents who are constrained to leave their jobs at the drop of a hat in order to pick their children from schools.\n\nIt was further argued that the lack of any SOP for such situations results in lack of coordination and chaos which ultimately delays any evacuation and in case of an actual bomb being planted, the results could be catastrophic.

threats in schools - Weekly Voice", "body": "New Delhi, May 6 (VOICE) The Delhi High Court on Monday sought a detailed response from the Delhi Government and Delhi Police regarding their preparedness and procedures for handling bomb threats in schools.Justice Subramonium Prasad was hearing a plea filed by lawyer Arpit Bhargava after a bomb threat email was received from Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, last year, which later turned out to be a prank by one of the students \"just for fun\".\n\nBhargava, who is a parent, recently also filed an application contending the lack of progress in investigating and resolving three out of five bomb threat incidents reported in schools last year.\n\nLast week, a total of 125 bomb threat complaints were received from different schools on the emergency helpline number 112 from 5.47 a.m. to 2.13 p.m..\n\nBhargava's plea contends the lack of a coordinated action plan to ensure the safety and security of schoolchildren, teachers, and staff in response to bomb threats.\n\nJustice Prasad sought information on the specific roles of nodal officers assigned to handle such threats, the number of mock drills conducted, and the preparedness measures in place across different zones.\n\nThe court has given the authorities 10 days to file an affidavit detailing their current protocols and the circulars issued on this matter over time.\n\nBhargava stressed the urgency of establishing a comprehensive action plan, criticising the current lack of specific procedures tailored to the unique environment of schools.\n\nIn court, the counsel for the Delhi Government, Santosh Kumar Tripathi, assured that the police have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for responding to both hoax and real threats, which includes immediate police notification and evacuation protocols.\n\nHowever, Justice Prasad expressed concern that these SOPs might be too generalised and not sufficiently focused on the specific needs of schools, which range from nursery to high school levels.\n\nFurther submissions revealed that while mock drills are regularly conducted, there is a pressing need for a more specialised SOP that addresses the unique vulnerabilities of educational institutions.\n\nThe court stressed the necessity of involving parents in these drills and ensuring that every school has a robust and rehearsed evacuation plan.\n\nThe matter is set to be heard next on May 16.\n\nLast week, the Directorate of Education (DoE) apprised the High Court of its \"zero-tolerance policy\" regarding safety in schools, particularly amid concerns related to bomb threats.\n\nThe DoE has submitted a status report indicating its proactive measures to ensure effective implementation of safety guidelines.\n\nAccording to the status report, it issued various directives to schools to enhance their safety and security protocols.\n\nThese include a circular dated April 16, outlining precautionary measures and delineating the roles of school authorities in handling bomb threats.\n\nThe DoE said that while it is committed to enforcing safety measures, addressing bomb threats primarily falls under the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies.\n\nNonetheless, it has taken significant steps, including convening emergent meetings to devise safety plans and issuing circulars to guide schools in conducting safety audits and preparing for potential disasters.\n\nThe report highlighted the DoE's comprehensive approach to addressing safety concerns, encompassing stakeholder consultations, expert opinions, and issuance of detailed guidelines through various circulars.\n\nMoreover, measures such as making parents aware of the consequences of hoax threat calls, conducting safety walks, and implementing mock drills for evacuation have been initiated.\n\nFurthermore, the DoE has established an online reporting mechanism for schools to regularly update their safety status.\n\nThe petitioner had cited the alarming frequency of bomb threats and stressed the need for swift and effective measures to ensure the safety of children and all stakeholders.\n\nThe latest application filed by the petitioner referenced a recent bomb threat email directed at the court itself, underscoring the urgency of the situation.\n\nThe court had earlier also impleaded various private schools' organisations as respondents to the case and issued notices to them.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The matter is next listed on May 20.\n\nAdvocate Beenashaw Soni, appearing for Bhargava, said the recent status report submitted by the Directorate of Education pointed to circulars issued in 2017-2018.\n\n\"If they haven't implemented anything now, it shows their further failure. Despite the fact they had all this they were unable to do anything,\" Soni said.\n\n\"Everyone in this city has a kid. Parents are traumatised, they feel insecure. It's like sending their kids to a war zone...The petition was filed in 2023. Nothing is in place. Are we waiting for a bomb to explode in a school to go on a war footing to put these measures in line,\" Soni added.\n\n'Deployment of constabulary at each and every school not possible'\n\nMeanwhile, the standing counsel for the Delhi government, Santosh Kumar Tripathi, said that he shared the sentiment raised by Soni, adding that, however, last week's threats were hoaxes.\n\n\"The police have a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on how to deal with situations particularly in cases of actual or hoax bomb threats. The protocol says the first thing is the evacuation...We have around 5,500 schools including primary, secondary and senior secondary schools. Deployment of constabulary at each and every school with modern equipment is not possible and not feasible. To avoid and to deal with the situation, the Police has issued its own SOP every private school is informed what to do,\" Tripathi said.\n\nThe court, however, orally said the SOP issued was not specific to dealing with situations of this kind, where a school receives a threat.\n\nAn officer of the Directorate of Education who was present in the hearing said that a direction had been issued to the \"schools to conduct mock drills quarterly\". \"They send the action-taken report after doing the mock drill. We monitor them. Regularly it is in place. Disaster management committee composition is also there,\" the official said.\n\nIn a status report filed last month, the Directorate of Education referred to an April 16 circular that listed the precautionary measures undertaken by school authorities in incidents of bomb threats received by schools. These include schools making structural changes with an eye towards preventing break-ins, removing unnecessary items where bombs may be hidden, sharing the layout of the school with police and holding timely mock drills in coordination with local police.\n\n\"The department is practising a zero-tolerance policy towards the safety issues and has directed all the schools under its jurisdiction to step up the safety and security measures and has issued various circulars dated 20.08.2018, 29.08.2022, 03.11.2023, 16.02.2024, 04.03.2024 with detailed directions to all the stakeholders on the issues of safety and security and standard,\" the report stated.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "malavika_prasad@indianexpress.com", "name": "Malavika Prasad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bomb threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard operating procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zero tolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Untitled-design-5-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541914", "eventUri": "eng-9541914", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1265, "textEnd": 1271}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 3238, "textEnd": 3246}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-08-20", "textStart": 3852, "textEnd": 3863}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

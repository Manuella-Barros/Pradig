Djokovic, who was due to play Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals, blamed the \"slippery\" surface at Roland Garros for the injury. \"I had slight discomfort in the right k...\n\nPARIS -- It would be foolish to count Novak Djokovic out of any match, no matter how dire the circumstances or how steep the deficit. He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nYear after year, folks wondered when it would unravel for all of them. Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laver Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magicvalley.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/19/c193f792-489b-59ad-8a9d-b2fc6bb03281/6660826d8920d.image.jpg?crop=612%2C321%2C0%2C11&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2655, "textEnd": 2661}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 2864, "textEnd": 2871}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

The other men's semifinal will be No. 2 Jannik Sinner against No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nWith Djokovic, the owner of three French Open titles, gone from the bracket, and Rafael Nadal -- owner of a record 14 -- eliminated in the first round, someone will be holding the French Open men's trophy for the first time on Sunday.\n\nAnd on Monday, when the new ATP rankings are released, Djokovic will slide down from the top spot and be replaced by Sinner, who becomes the first Italian man to get to No. 1.\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "howard_fendrich@register-herald.com", "name": "Howard Fendrich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/50/b50586fc-7efe-5249-ba5a-df4e55266fc5/665f3288d2c37.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1781, "textEnd": 1787}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 1839, "textEnd": 1846}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nYear after year, folks wondered when it would unravel for all of them. Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1\u00bd years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4\u00bd hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12-of-19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.", "source": {"uri": "newstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jefferson City News Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laver Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2024/06/05/novak_ZZu6Mdz_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2348, "textEnd": 2354}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 2528, "textEnd": 2535}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLittle Chicago Deli reopens in Sioux City Friday Sioux City Marina operator responds to city's lawsuit SUX Pride creating a festive something for everybody event in Sioux City Woodbury County Court Report for May 28, 2024 Mary Jo (Sailors) McInnis East's Mackenzie Crawford is Broadway-bound for a chance at the Jimmys Athlete of the Week: A budding star emerging for SB-L in Moreau Fatal hit-and-run suspect returned to Sioux City, faces 4 charges Day-long, downtown event highlights 'So Much To Do' in Sioux City Boys state soccer: Heelan captures first state title with OT win over Assumption Nebraska baseball's NCAA tournament run continues after Huskers eliminate Niagara Parents of another Hinton wrestler sue coaches, school for alleged assaults Greenwell's attorney response to $53,000 fees in Gausman lawsuit, stating it should be halved Woman believed to be dead turns out to be alive at Nebraska funeral home, officials say Nelson, McNaughton seek Woodbury County Supervisors seat\n\nYear after year, folks wondered when it would unravel for all of them. Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand

The Serbian had to play in the quarterfinals against Norway's Casper Ruud.\n\nL'Equipe confirmed the intervention of Djokovic, who will have about three weeks of recovery, so his presence at Wimbledon is practically ruled out. The tournament in London will start on July 1 and the Serbian has to defend last year's final, so his absence would also be marked in a ranking that will be led by Italian Jannik Sinner starting Monday.\n\n\"In the third game of the second set, I slipped, one of the many times that happened to me today. And that affected my knee. My injury could have been prevented. I had no problems in other tournaments, until today. Finishing the previous game so late (he played against Lorenzo Musetti until three in the morning) didn't help me sleep, for the biorhythms, the recovery,\" Novak explained after the match against Cer\u00fandolo and also pointed to the situation on the court: \"There were areas where there was no more clay left, only cement; perhaps due to the change in conditions, the sun and the heat, it seemed as if some dirt had been removed. I have fallen many times in my career, but I haven't slipped as many times in the same game as this time. That's exactly why the injury happened.\"\n\nIf everything continues as planned, Djokovic's return would be precisely on the same stage where he was injured. The thing is that after Wimbledon and a lawn that wouldn't help his knee either, it will be time for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and that's where the Serbian, who had his last operation in February 2018 for an elbow problem, points out.\n\nThe Olympic Games will officially begin on July 26, so there would be time for Djokovic to recover from the knee injury and try to achieve the only thing that his extraordinary career lacks: the gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "infobae.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "infobae"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/AyT0tTbnwe2DU0NRKDc5HBOThI8=/1200x630/filters:format(webp):quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/DZY73TQVZFEVXPQHZHWQXELVE4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 936, "textEnd": 942}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2287, "textEnd": 2294}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 2195, "textEnd": 2208}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The 37-year-old Serb sustained a torn medial meniscus during his fourth-round match against Francisco Cerundolo at Roland Garros.\n\nDespite playing on with pain medication, an MRI scan revealed the extent of Djokovic's knee injury, prompting him to pull out of the clay court major and undergo surgery. His withdrawal ended his quest for a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title and resulted in him losing the world number one ranking to Italian Jannik Sinner on Monday.\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match,\" Djokovic said in an Instagram post. \"I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well. I am so appreciative of the doctors and the support from my fans.\"\n\nDjokovic, who won three of the four majors in 2023, has struggled for form this season, failing to win a title.

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.\n\nTags Dcc Wire

Open and that it \"went well\", but gave no timeframe for his return.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final against Casper Ruud after a scan revealed a torn medial meniscus in his right knee.\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match,\" he posted on social media.\n\n\"I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well.\n\n\"I am so appreciative of the team of doctors who have been by my side as well as the overwhelming support I have received from my fans.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old made no mention of whether he would be fit to take part at Wimbledon which begins on July 1 but added that he was going to \"do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\".\n\n\"My love for this sport is strong and the desire to compete at the highest level is what keeps me going,\" he added.\n\nDjokovic withdrew from the French Open after winning a five-set match against Francisco Cerundolo and went on to blame the \"slippery\" Roland Garros courts for aggravating the problem.\n\n\"For the last couple weeks I have had, I would say, slight discomfort, I would call it that way, in the right knee, but I haven't had an injury that would be concerning me at all,\" Djokovic said after his record 370th win at a Grand Slam.\n\n\"I was playing a few tournaments with it, and no issues until today.\n\nThe Cerundolo victory was Djokovic's second five-setter in quick succession having come through a gruelling four-hour, 29-minute slog against Lorenzo Musetti in the third round that concluded at 3:07 am Sunday morning, the latest finish in French Open history.\n\nRuud, who lost to Djokovic in last year's final, received a walkover and will now play Alexander Zverev in the semi-finals on Friday.\n\nNadal lost in the first round at Roland Garros this year and revealed it was unlikely he would play on grass because the transition back to clay for the Olympics would be tough.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The surgery is taking place a day after Djokovic withdrew from the French Open following an MRI that confirmed the meniscus tear.\n\nDjokovic suffered the injury during his thrilling comeback win over Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth round at Roland Garros on Monday. The 37-year-old battled back from being down two sets to one, winning sets four and five 7-5 and 6-3 respectively to advance to his record-setting 59th major quarterfinal.\n\nDjokovic was set to face number seven seed Casper Ruud on Wednesday but the Norwegian will get a walkover to his third consecutive French Open semifinal. He'll face the winner of Alexander Zverev and Alex de Minaur.\n\nWith Wimbledon set to begin on July 1, Djokovic faces an uphill battle to get his body ready for The Championships. The seven-time Wimbledon champion reached the final in each of the last five tournaments, winning four in a row from 2018-2022 before losing to Carlos Alcaraz in the 2023 final (the tournament was not held in 2020 due to COVID-19).\n\nThough not impossible, it's highly improbable that Djokovic will be able to play at 100%, which makes his entry into Wimbledon doubtful. Risking another injury to his knee may not be worth it with a busy summer schedule approaching that includes the Paris Olympics. Djokovic has never reached the gold medal match at the Olympics, with his only medal being a bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe men's tennis tournament at the Paris Olympics begins on July 27.\n\nFrench Open climax nears with Novak Djokovic out of the picture\n\nWith Novak Djokovic pulling out of the French Open and Rafael Nadal dropping his first-round match to Zverev, this year's tournament will mark the first since 2015 in which neither man wins the men's singles draw. It's also the first time since 2009 that neither will feature in the final.\n\nAs Ruud awaits his opponent, the other semifinal is set as a clash between Alcaraz and impending world No. 1 Jannik Sinner will take place on Friday. Djokovic's withdrawal ensures that Sinner will overtake the 24-time Grand Slam winner for the top spot in the ATP rankings regardless of his finish at Roland Garros.\n\nSinner and Alcaraz are arguably the brightest stars in this next generation of men's tennis. Alcaraz is attempting to reach his fourth consecutive Grand Slam semifinal, while Sinner tries to keep the possibility of a second major title in 2024 after capturing his first career triumph at the Australian Open in January.\n\nThe pair will be among the favorites at next month's Wimbledon, especially if Djokovic is unable to play. Regardless of his status, the field will be wide open with the potential for another first-time winner.\n\nTo be the best you usually have to beat the best, but arguably the greatest men's tennis player to ever grace a court will miss two opportunities to add to his record Grand Slam total. Avoiding a date with Novak Djokovic in a major does not come around often. Someone will benefit from his absence.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_meyers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Meyers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/French-Open-news-Novak-Djokovic-surgery-is-bad-news-for-Wimbledon-status.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "dateEnd": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 482, "textEnd": 493}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 814, "textEnd": 820}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 1589, "textEnd": 1596}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.\n\n0 Comments Love 0

Treatments for meniscus tear can range from rest to surgery.\n\n\"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros,\" Djokovic wrote on social media.\n\n\"I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday's match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old Djokovic had cast doubt over his fitness following Monday's five-set win over Francisco Cerundolo, admitting he needed anti-inflammatory drugs to get through the match.\n\nDjokovic blamed the \"slippery\" Philippe Chatrier court for the injury he sustained early in the second set of his 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Cerundolo.\n\n\"I don't know what will happen tomorrow or after tomorrow if I'll be able to step out on the court and play. You know, I hope so. Let's see what happens,\" Djokovic said after his record 370th win at a Grand Slam.\n\n\"For the last couple weeks I have had, I would say, slight discomfort, I would call it that way, in the right knee, but I haven't had an injury that would be concerning me at all.\n\n\"I was playing a few tournaments with it, and no issues until today.\"\n\nDjokovic's injury was discussed on the Tennis Podcast and sports commentator Catherine Whitaker called it \"seismic news\" and said \"it's bad\".\n\nHost Matt Roberts noted that US pro Taylor Fritz went from being in a wheelchair to playing in Wimbledon in just four weeks, but agreed \"this is bad for sure\" for Djokovic.\n\n\"With Wimbledon on the horizon, the Olympics as well, at this stage we just don't know how long he's going to be out for.\n\n\"It's probably the first time he's had a serious lower body injury... in the medium term it casts quite a lot of doubt over the summer,\" he said, adding it could impact Djokovic's motivation to continue playing tennis professionally.\n\n\"We might look back on this moment as something that really signalled the end... it could be that serious.\"\n\nHost David Law said Federer at one point recovered from a knee injury caused by a bathroom slip to win the Australian Open and three more grand slam titles.\n\n\"If anybody was going to do that in tennis today, I would believe that Novak Djokovic could do it.\n\n\"I also think he has the kind of build that seems like it can recover and so forth.\"\n\nHe agreed that the injury could \"finish\" Djokovic.\n\nDjokovic has spent a record 428 weeks at the top of the rankings. His injury extends his worst start to a season since 2018, when he didn't win an event until claiming the Wimbledon title.\n\nIt is only the second time this deep into the year he hasn't lifted a trophy since he won his first ATP title as a teenager in 2006.\n\nAdding to his problems, he was accidentally hit on the head by a metal water bottle in Rome last month before suffering stomach problems in Geneva.\n\nDjokovic last retired at a Grand Slam during the 2019 US Open, when a shoulder problem forced him to quit against Stan Wawrinka in the last 16.\n\nHe now faces a race against time to be fit for Wimbledon, which begins July 1. Djokovic is a seven-time winner at the All England Club, one shy of Roger Federer's record.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_backhouse@news.com.au", "name": "Andrew Backhouse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_tear", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus tear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Law_(broadcaster)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Law (broadcaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Wawrinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/8b85d519a37b94196a24f2108c50809d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 3575, "textEnd": 3581}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Wimbledon, which is scheduled to run July 1-14. According to the Daily Mail, \"the best-case scenario in terms of recovery time from medial meniscus surgery is three weeks. That would theoretically give him a chance of playing (Wimbledon), but once you factor in additional time for recovering his match-fitness and adjusting to the grass -- a surface that puts a lot of strain on the knees -- it looks impossible, even for a man with his extraordinary powers of physical recovery.\"\n\nDjokovic, 37, finished out his fourth-round victory over Francisco Cerundolo despite exacerbating the knee injury mid-match. He told reporters it had been bothering him for a couple of weeks prior.\n\nAlthough he was not immediately certain he would need to withdraw, Djokovic subsequently underwent an MRI in Paris on Tuesday that confirmed the meniscus tear, forcing the 24-time Grand Slam winner to exit.\n\nDjokovic is the No. 1-ranked player in the world. His unparalleled star power lends an air of celebrity to any tournament. Certainly, he would be the main attraction at Wimbledon if he is able to play. If not, the men's tournament bracket would take on an entirely different look, potentially making it the first Wimbledon since 1998 without one of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, or Djokovic in competition.\n\nThe Daily Mail called it \"likely\" that Djokovic would target his return for the Summer Olympics, which begin July 27 in Paris at Roland Garros.\n\nDjokovic will be unable to defend his 2023 victory at the French Open, putting his 99th career tournament victory on hold. If healthy, Djokovic would have been bidding to win Wimbledon for the first time since 2022.\n\nDjokovic's only medal at an Olympic Games came in 2008 when he defeated James Blake in the bronze-medal men's singles match in Beijing. It was the first Olympic tennis medal in Serbian history.\n\nIn the meantime, Djokovic leaves fans with a memorable five-set victory over Cerundolo, which boosted his professional singles record to 1105-219.\n\n\"How did I find the way to win again? I don't know,\" Djokovic told the crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier after securing the win. \"The only explanation I have is you.

While recovery should take around three weeks, the 24-time Grand Slam champion is highly unlikely to be able to play Wimbledon.\n\nDjokovic sustained a knee injury during his five-set victory over Francisco Cerundolo in the French Open fourth round on Monday with an MRI scan revealing a torn medial meniscus in his right knee, which prompted his withdrawal from the tournament.\n\nSportKlub reported on Wednesday that the meniscus injury was not severe and does not require a lengthy rehabilitation. However, with Wimbledon starting on 1 July, the Serbian star looks set to miss the grass-court Slam in London.\n\nThe 37-year-old could be ready for the Paris Olympics, with the tennis event set to begin at Roland Garros on 27 July. Djokovic, who won an Olympic bronze medal in 2008, has openly expressed his ambition to add a gold medal to his illustrious career.\n\nDjokovic, who favours natural remedies over surgical interventions, admitted to crying for several days after his elbow surgery in 2018. The swiftness of his decision to undergo this knee operation speaks volumes. The seven-time Wimbledon champion provided no indication of a recovery timeline in his statement on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros,\" he said. \"I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday's match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation.\"\n\nJohnny Wilson, lead physiotherapist at 108 Harley Street, deemed it \"very unlikely\" that Djokovic would compete at Wimbledon, though he did not completely rule it out.\n\n\"They've gone for surgery to give him the best opportunity to make Wimbledon, I've no doubt about that. You won't make a decision that quick if there isn't something impending,\" Wilson told the PA news agency.\n\n\"The Olympics is more likely. If you're going for minor surgery today, I'm not sure that's a great idea. But any surgeon who would say they could predict the future, I would question that.\"\n\nDjokovic's withdrawal from Roland Garros not only ended his title defence but also cost him the world number one ranking, with Italy's Jannik Sinner set to claim the top spot on Monday.

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nYear after year, folks wondered when it would unravel for all of them. Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laver Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/fe/1fe87629-67c1-5e79-96f7-0ec74eca3e39/6660826de3a29.image.jpg?crop=612%2C321%2C0%2C11&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2549, "textEnd": 2555}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 2758, "textEnd": 2765}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first-round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth-round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nThis is what Djokovic said on the day he won that drought-ending, run-starting title at the All England Club six years ago: \"There were several moments where I was frustrated and questioning whether I can get back (to the) desired level or not. But that makes this whole journey even more special for me.\"\n\nGiven his oft-demonstrated resolve, it should not shock anyone to hear him echo that sentiment down the road.\n\nTags Dcc Wire

Norwegian seventh seed Ruud will therefore progress straight to the semi-finals.\n\nDjokovic's withdrawal ends his quest for a record-extending 25th Grand Slam trophy and will result in him losing the world No 1 ranking to Italian Jannik Sinner later this month.\n\nIn a statement released on Instagram, Djokovic said: \"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros.\n\n\"I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday's match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation.\n\n\"I wish the best of luck to the players competing this week and sincerely thank the incredible fans for all of the love and continued support.\"\n\nIt is unclear how long the injury will keep Djokovic out of action and whether the Serb will be fit for Wimbledon, which starts on July 1.\n\nDjokovic had been dealing with a knee injury for weeks and needed anti-inflammatory tablets during Monday's second set of his five-set victory over Francisco Cerundolo.\n\nThe 37-year-old slipped on the court and began grimacing and rubbing his right knee before receiving medical attention several times, telling the physio: \"I screwed up my knee. I'm slipping and sliding all the time.\"\n\nFour games later, having asked for the court to be swept, he complained to a tournament supervisor about the state of the surface, saying: \"I'm telling you as a player, it's not OK.\"\n\nAfter the game, Djokovic said: \"For the last couple weeks I have had slight discomfort, I would call it, in the right knee, but I haven't had an injury that would be concerning me at all. I was playing a few tournaments with it, and had no issues until today.\n\n\"Of course, [the] late finish from a few nights ago didn't help the sleeping, the biorhythm, and recovery. But I actually felt great coming into the match - as good as I could under the circumstances - and played really well first set. Then in the third game of the second set, I slipped, one of the many times that I slipped and fell today. That affected the knee.\"\n\nThere has been mixed reports as to whether Djokovic has undergone surgery on his knee, French newspaper L'Equipe reporting that Djokovic underwent surgery on Wednesday Paris, while the Serbian Olympic committee president tweeted that he spoke to Djokovic's uncle who says he actually has not had surgery.\n\nOn the conflicting reports, Sky Sports Tennis' Jonathan Overend said: \"We wait for confirmation from the man himself but whether he has undergone surgery or not, it is clear he is going to be out of the game for a good few weeks.\n\n\"It has to put his participation at Wimbledon in serious doubt.\n\n\"I think there is a chance that, even if he has not had surgery, he won't play Wimbledon. You have to remember, this is the toughest time of the year for tennis players.\n\n\"They go from clay to grass and it is a short turnaround. Djokovic has won the tournament seven times but his priority this year is the Olympic Games.\"\n\nHenman: Djokovic withdrawal 'hugely disappointing'\n\nDjokovic revealed after his last-16 victory he was unsure whether he would be able to continue at the tournament, although Sky Sports analyst Tim Henman was surprised that he was unable to return for his quarter-final.\n\n\"We've seen in Australia a couple of times with the pulled stomach muscle that he kept talking about, but he kept playing and went on to win the tournament,\" Henman told Eurosport. \"He had a problem with his hamstring there and he kept playing. So for me, I just felt this like was precautionary.\n\n\"I very much expected him to bounce back, as we've seen so many times. It came as a huge shock to me. When you hear that there may be a tear in the meniscus - that's a serious injury so that's hugely disappointing for Djokovic.\"\n\nOn the challenges of tournament scheduling, Henman added: \"When some of these matches are finishing at two o'clock, three o'clock in the morning, it's not good for the players and it's not good for everyone. The scheduling is absolutely critical.\n\n\"When you take into account he [Djokovic] has played two matches and has played over nine hours of tennis, and when you add to that very late into the night, into the following morning, I think that's putting an enormous strain on players physically and mentally.\"\n\nWill Djokovic be fit for Wimbledon?\n\nWimbledon takes place between July 1 and July 14, where Djokovic lost in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in last year's final.\n\nBoris Becker, Eurosport pundit and Djokovic's former coach, fears for his chances of competing at Wimbledon, where he is a seven-time champion.\n\nBecker said: \"It's a serious injury and it won't go away tomorrow. That leaves me a bit speechless. You need your knees on grass, you really do slip all the time. A torn medial meniscus is a serious injury and the question naturally arises as to whether surgery is necessary.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of Djokovic's summer, Sky Sports' Annabel Croft said: \"Only time will tell, and of course he was very keen to try and play in the Olympics. That's something that he wants desperately, is that gold medal, so I think a lot of his year was kind of geared up towards focusing on that in a very, very big goal for him.\n\n\"I guess he's going to have further investigation, tests and a lot of treatments to see what he can do. He has done some extraordinary things with his body when he's had injury problems in the past. He's used oxygen therapy to try to sort of take down swelling and to reduce injuries.\n\n\"Knowing the character that he is and how professional he is, he will leave no stone unturned and he will look into absolutely the best advice, the best treatments, the best physios, the best everything that he possibly can to get himself fit, ready and back on the court again.\"\n\nWhat's coming up on Sky Sports Tennis?\n\nIn the run-up to the third Grand Slam of 2024 - Wimbledon - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the grass-court

They were later married in 2014 in Montenegro\n\nDuring his five-set thriller against Francisco Cerundulo, Jelena was seen up on her feet in the player's box shouting after Djokovic dropped a point on serve\n\nDjokovic will instead target the Olympics, which begin on July 27 back here at Roland Garros. A gold medal is the only thing missing from his collection and the Paris Games have always been Djokovic's biggest goal this year.\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Novak Djokovic WITHDRAWS from the French Open with a knee injury before quarter-final clash - hours after on-court domestic with his wife\n\nThis is the only the second surgery of Djokovic's career. A devout believer in natural healing, he claimed to have cried with guilt for days after having an elbow operation in 2018.\n\nIt took Djokovic two years of pain and indecision to bring himself to fix that elbow - the fact he went under the knife less than 48 hours after this knee injury indicates how eager he is to be fit for the Olympics.\n\nWith Roger Federer retired and Rafael Nadal almost certain to skip Wimbledon - again, with a view to the Olympics - this will be the first Championships since 1998 to take place with none of the Big Three in the draw.\n\nIt was knee damage that did for Federer, as he retired having had four bouts of surgery. Djokovic will pray his issues are nowhere near so chronic.\n\nDespite finishing his game against Francisco Cerundolo, he was forced to pull out of the tournament\n\nThe exchange was seemingly over after he returned to his service position and his wife then sat down\n\nIf he can make a full recovery, there is no reason why he cannot play on for several years. But there is recent evidence that Carlos Alcaraz and, particularly, new world No1 Jannik Sinner have the beating of the 24-time Grand Slam champion.\n\nThose two, who meet in a much-anticipated semi-final here in Paris tomorrow, are only going to get better.

AFP\n\nNovak Djokovic has admitted that the 2024 season has not gone as per plan . After being knocked out by Casper Ruud in Monte Carlo, Djokovic had said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to a really high standard in terms of expectations and result. Not having a title is \u00e2\u20ac\" compared to the last 15 years \u00e2\u20ac\" not a great season at all.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had semis in Australia (the Australian Open), the semis here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal to expect that you have some seasons where you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start well - this is the one,\u00e2\u20ac he added.\n\nAt Indian Wells and Rome, Djokovic lost in the Round of 32 and had another semi-final run at the Geneva Open in preparation for the French Open. At the Italian Open in Rome, he was accidentally hit on the head by a metal water bottle last month before suffering stomach problems in Geneva.\n\nOne would need to go back to the 2018 season to see such a trophy drought for the Serb. That year, Djokovic's first title came at Wimbledon in what was his 13th major title. He's added 11 since. That is 11 major titles from 21 (or 19 if you remove the 2022 Australian Open where he was deported and US Open where he was ineligible).\n\nEven after such a poor season, it would have been foolish to count defending French Open champion Djokovic out. No matter how dire the circumstances, how steep the deficit is. He's shown that many times over the years - and he did in the last week as well.\n\nHis five setter against Lorenzo Musetti finished at 3:07 am having started late due to multiple factors. Novak trailed two-sets-to-one against the Italian before triumphing 6-3 and 6-0 in the fourth and fifth sets.\n\nA day later, he was required to do much of the same. Once again he trailed by two-sets-to-one, this time against Francisco Cerundolo, and by a break in the fourth set.\n\nEarly in the second set, Djokovic tweaked his knee and took a medical timeout. A trainer worked on the joint and during subsequent changeovers, and the 37-year-old took the maximum dose of pills allowed to dull the pain and reduce any inflammation.\n\nEventually, Djokovic persisted, kept fighting, put the pressure on the Argentine and scraped through in four-and-a-half-hours . But it came at a cost. Over the two matches, Djokovic spent a staggering nine hours on court. He later revealed that the knee had been bothering him for a couple of weeks.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what will happen tomorrow \u00e2\u20ac\" or, after tomorrow, if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to step out on the court and play,\u00e2\u20ac Djokovic said on Monday evening .\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was,\u00e2\u20ac Djokovic said afterward, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe three or four points away from losing this match.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I mean, today I injured myself. Yes, I survived. I won the match. Great. But will I be able to play next one?\u00e2\u20ac he said, tapping his palms on a table for emphasis.\n\nThe answer to that came the next day.\n\nRoland Garros announced his withdrawal , saying an MRI scan had revealed the full extent of the injury.\n\n\"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros,\" Djokovic wrote on social media.\n\n\"I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday's match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation.\"\n\nThe last time he retired at a Grand Slam was during the 2019 US Open when a shoulder problem forced him to quit against Stan Wawrinka in the last-16.\n\nWas this one preventable though? The 37-year-old had complained about the state of the clay in the match with Musetti, and did so again against Cerundolo, calling for the court to be swept more regularly.\n\n\"Could have this injury be prevented? Possibly, if there was just a little bit more of a frequent care of the court,\" Djokovic said.\n\nHis withdrawal not only opens the door for Casper Ruud to advance untested, but it also means that Jannik Sinner will become Italy's first world number one next week.\n\nSinner advanced to his first French Open semi-final shortly after Djokovic's exit, defeating Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets.\n\n\"It's every player's dream to become number one in the world. On the other hand, seeing Novak retiring (from the tournament) is disappointing, so I wish him a speedy recovery,\" said Sinner.\n\nFor Djokovic, it is an end to 39 straight weeks at the top - taking his overall tally to a record 428 weeks.\n\nThe road ahead, should he get fit, isn't straightforward either.\n\nWimbledon, which he has won seven times \u00e2\u20ac\" one less than Roger Federer, starts on 1 July. The Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on 27 July at Roland Garros.\n\nThere's not been a final to show this season, let alone a title. There's no permanent replacement for coach Goran Ivanisevic either.\n\nThe road ahead in terms of ranking points gets tougher too. He will be defending 1200 points at the All England Club, 1000 points in Cincinnati, 2000 points at the US Open, 1000 points at the Paris Masters and 1300 points at the ATP Finals. In all, he has 6600 points to defend with Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz hot on his heels.\n\nThe more Djokovic looks to the future, the more he also has to look back. Look back at multiple moments in the match against Cerundolo. Did he err in pushing on to play when his body was clearly shutting down and only stayed upright with medication? The Serb admitted that by the fifth set when the meds had kicked in, he was pain-free. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Basically the whole fifth set [I] was almost without any pain,\u00e2\u20ac he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I'm glad that I was able to play without feeling that pain that I felt for two-and-a-half sets.\u00e2\u20ac Reality check hit the next morning.\n\nMaybe Djokovic should have paid heed to the warning signs depicted by his Big 3 peers. Roger Federer injured his knee in 2016 and spent a considerable period out. Rafael Nadal, who went out in the first round to Alexander Zverev , has had years of hip and abdominal injuries .\n\nFor someone who has always listened to his body and strictly relied on the 'my body is my temple' school of thought, Djokovic would hope this isn't a cautionary tale of someone who betrayed that belief in a desperate attempt at yet another conquest.", "source": {"uri":

The 24-time Grand Slam winner will now need at least three weeks recovery time which could end his hopes of appearing at SW19.\n\nThe Championships at the All-England club begin on July 1 and a top physio believes it is \"very unlikely\" that Djokovic, who has won Wimbledon on seven occasions, will be able to compete for an eighth title on the grass.\n\nLast year Djokovic won three Grand Slams with Wimbledon the only one to evade him. He made the final but was beaten in a thriller by Carlos Alcaraz and may miss the chance to gain revenge on the Spaniard.\n\nPhysio Johnny Wilson of 108 Harley Street said: \"They've gone for surgery to give him the best opportunity to make Wimbledon. You won't make a decision that quick if there isn't something impending. The Olympics is more likely. If you're going for minor surgery today, I'm not sure that's a great idea. But any surgeon who would say they could predict the future, I would question that.\"\n\nWith the Olympics taking place in Paris it means the tennis will be held at the French Open venue, giving Djokovic the chance to land success at Roland Garros after injury curtailed his efforts this year. The Serbian has never claimed Olympic gold, giving him the chance to add to his legacy.\n\nThe veteran has been quick to undergo surgery, which he hadn't previously needed since 2018, with the US Open on his radar come August. That will present Djokovic with the next opportunity to land a 25th Grand Slam title.\n\nDjokovic has competed at Wimbledon every year its been held since first competing in 2005.

Apart from a subpar 16-6 YTD, Djokovic has also failed to reach the finals in any of the tournaments he has participated in. With his latest move of withdrawing from the French Open 2024 quarterfinals, the Serbian superstar has snapped an impressive 6-year streak.\n\nWith Novak Djokovic expected to miss the entirety of July after injuring his knee, he will be finishing the first half of the 2024 season with no silverware to show. The last time that Djokovic was trophyless in the first half of the season was 6 years ago.\n\nThe elbow injury that he sustained during the mid-2017 season could be blamed for his disappointing performance during the first six months of 2018. While the 24-time Grand Slam champion was still recovering from the injury, he did participate in 8 tournaments before July 2018.\n\nIn 2024 as well, Djokovic has participated in considerably fewer tournaments, i.e. 6, but it had nothing to do with injuries.\n\nHowever, the then-31-year-old managed to turn around his 2018 season in the second half. Despite not being touted as one of the favorites, Novak Djokovic displayed his resilience by winning the Wimbledon Championships. He also dominated the US Open 2018, lifting the title at the Arthur Ashe Stadium as well.\n\nWith the virtue of winning four titles, i.e. 2 Grand Slams and 2 ATP Masters 1000 tournaments in the second half of that season, Djokovic managed to redeem himself and regain the World No.1 spot.\n\nNovak Djokovic believes he will get back on the ATP Tour as soon as possible after posting on Instagram on Thursday that he has had a successful knee surgery.\n\nDjokovic could take inspiration from his 2018 season to turn it around in the second half. However, it won't be that simple a task this time. It is important to keep in mind that Djokovic is significantly older - age 37 - and the recovery time might be longer than what it took him 6 years ago.\n\nThe Serb could miss important events such as those in the grass court season and the start of the hard court season. Hence, potentially missing out on a longer duration could result in Djokovic tumbling down in the standings even further. So skipping ATP 1000 events such as the Miami Masters and the Madrid Open might prove very costly for him.\n\nNovak Djokovic will lose 1,600 points after the French Open 2024 concludes. With Jannik Sinner already overtaking him as the World No.1, Carlos Alcaraz is gearing up to move ahead of the veteran for the World No.2 ranking. But for that, Alcaraz will have to beat Sinner in the semifinals and win the final of the French Open too, which is possible but an uphill task.\n\nDjokovic's other rivals such as Daniil Medvedev of Russia and Alexander Zverev of Germany will fancy their chances of moving up the rankings if the Serb continues to be out of action.\n\nConsidering that Djokovic is expected to be out for 3-6 weeks, the 24-time Grand Slam champion might not get a chance to participate in two of the biggest tournaments of the year - the Wimbledon 2024 and the Olympics 2024.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Novak Djokovic approaches a major injury at this stage of his career. However, being a fierce competitor, fans can expect him to become competitive again and emerge stronger from setbacks he has faced this year.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ashe_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Ashe Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/03/fd95f41c-untitled-design-2024-03-05t175137.531.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-", "textStart": 861, "textEnd": 870}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

exclusively to Tennis365 ahead of the launch of the Curro Centre Court Series, which will bring a new level of top-quality tournaments to South Africa this summer, respected broadcaster Koenig admits he has been stunned by the speed of Djokovic's fall from grace.\n\n\"I had Djokovic down for at least two majors in 2024, but it is amazing how quickly things can change,\" Koenig told Tennis365.\n\n\"The way Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have emerged, I feel like Wimbledon may be his best shot at winning another major now as those two young guys are so strong on hard courts.\n\n\"Who knows, this meniscus problem be the ultimate straw that breaks the camel's back for Djokovic .\"\n\nKoenig went on to suggest the rise of Sinner and Alcaraz may hasten Djokovic's exit from the sport, with the Serbian legend admitting on several occasions this year that he is struggling for motivation during this phase of his career.\n\n\"Sinner and Alcaraz have proved that they can beat him at the biggest tournaments and that didn't happen with the previous generation of players who tried to take Novak down,\" added Koenig. \"They are young, they are hungry, they want his scalp.\"\n\nDjokovic has yet to confirm if he will try and make a return to play at Wimbledon on July 1, yet that would put his hopes of winning Olympic gold for Serbia in Paris on the line and most experts now expect him to target that event as he looks to complete his collection of title wins and cement his status as the best male player of all-time.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com",

After the one a few days ago over Lorenzo Musetti, at Roland Garros comes another comeback victory for a Novak Djokovic at half-serve. Against the Argentine Francisco Cer\u00fandolo, the Serbian also resisted a knee injury, managing to win in five sets after 4 and a half hours of battle.\n\nHis presence in the quarterfinals of Roland Garros 2024 against Casper Ruud is at great risk at this point and the number one himself spoke about his physical condition. Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic explained the nature of his knee problem.\n\n\"I asked for physiotherapy because I felt pain. This affected my game. For two sets I didn't want to participate in many rallies. If he did drop shots or changes of direction, I didn't feel comfortable in the rallies.\n\nAt a certain point I asked myself whether to continue playing or not, given what was happening. After the third set I asked for more medicine. I took the maximum dose I could take and I started to feel the effects in the fourth set.\n\nI felt less restricted in my movements. In the fifth set I played without pain, but the effect of the medicines doesn't last forever, so we'll see.\n\nThe Serb continued: \"I have played other tournaments with muscle tears in the past. The adrenaline we feel also helps us. The good thing about a Slam is that you have a day of rest between matches, and that can help recovery.\n\nI don't know what will happen tomorrow. I don't know if I will be able to play on Wednesday. I hope so\". The 24-time Grand Slam champion then argued about the conditions of the court. \"Because of the weather, the conditions this year are a bit particular.\n\nThere was a lot of rain, very heavy, and this affects the ground. This is a living surface, like grass. Clay can be treated, not like grass. Roland Garros is the tournament that treats clay best, without a doubt. I think the sun today affected clay, in some way.\n\nI don't know what they did, but it seems like they took something out of clay that is not on the court. My injury happened because, because of this, the ground becomes very slippery\". WTA legend Justine Henin talked about Nole Djokovic: \"He's done it so many times but today we saw him struggling, unable to react.\n\nHis start left us with a lot of doubts so some had fears about his motivation at Roland\u2010Garros. He still seems determined to go further,\" Justine Henin said.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149567.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Medical personnel on site at Roland Garros have told The Athletic that the meniscus tear -- the same injury that forced Roger Federer to have multiple surgeries throughout his career -- was likely an inevitable consequence of degenerative wear and tear, rather than an acute and sudden problem.\n\nDjokovic confirmed in a statement on Thursday that his surgery had gone well and that he is \"going to do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\".\n\nHe said: \"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match.

We called his (Novak's) uncle, and we received information that Novak did not have surgery. I would not like to speculate further,\" Maljkovic was quoted as stating.\n\n\"In any case, kudos to Novak. To play such a match in such a condition. We would all like him to be with us and lead the Olympic team. He is a wonderful man who makes other athletes better. He showed that in Tokyo.\"\n\nMaljkovic's version of events appears to be wide of the mark as Djokovic is believed to have had the medical procedure required to treat his knee in Paris, as he appreciated every day woild count in his bid to make it back in time for Wimbledon.\n\nDjokovic does not normally play any grass courts events ahead of The Championships at the All England Club so he will not be missing any tournaments due to this injury, but the big decision he will need to make is whether to try and come back at Wimbledon.\n\nPlaying on grass is a big test for knee joints as you need to get low to the ball and Djokovic's agility around the court has always been one of his superpowers that has given him an edge over his rivals.\n\nIn a year when he has made it clear that his chief focus is on trying to win an Olympic gold medal in the singles at the Paris Games, Djokovic will now face a decision over whether to risk his knee problem at Wimbledon or hold his fire for his attempt to win an elusive medal for Serbia in a tournament that will be staged at the Roland Garros venue that is hosting the French Open.\n\nShaun O'Brien, consultant orthopaedic surgeon and knee specialist, believes Djokovic's age and the urgency of the situation is likely to have influenced him to undergo a minor procedure.\n\n\"If he was Carlos Alcaraz's age, I'm sure they would go for a meniscal cartilage repair because he's got 10, 15 years of a long professional career ahead of him and they want to try to preserve that knee as long as possible,\" said O'Brien.\n\n\"But, if they repair it, he would be out for several months, there would be no way he would play Wimbledon or the Olympics.\n\n\"But, if they just trim back the little bit that's torn, he'll be back into light training in about three to four weeks' time with the hope of maybe getting back to some competitive tennis round about six to eight weeks' time.\n\n\"I've got no idea about where the tear is, what the configuration is, how big it is, but he's probably had it trimmed back a little bit to give him the best chance of playing in the Olympics.\"\n\nDjokovic will not have long to make his decision, with Wimbledon set to get underway on July 1.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_palmer@tennis365.com", "name": "Kevin Palmer",

But with the help of painkillers, Djokovic was able to play out the match and claim a five-set win.\n\nHowever, Djokovic didn't look particularly happy in his press conference as he indicated he may be forced to withdraw from the quarterfinal if his MRI scan returns with bad news.\n\n\"Good thing about the slam is that you have a day between that will allow hopefully the healing process to happen more efficiently for me,\" Djokovic said in his press conference after beating Cerundolo.\n\n\"That's it. I don't know what will happen tomorrow -- or after tomorrow, if I'll be able to step out on the court and play. You know, I hope so. Let's see what happens.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Djokovic's worst fears became reality after it was revealed that his meniscus was torn.\n\n\"This is bad news for all Djokovic fans, and I'm one of them,\" Becker told Eurosport Germany.\n\n\"You could almost guess it after the match against Cerundolo, which he played with a limp.\n\n\"The painkillers made the fifth set easier, but he had already warned that evening what the next morning would be like. He already had knee problems at the last few tournaments but never spoke about them.\"\n\nBecker, who worked with Djokovic for three and a half years in the past and won six Grand Slams together, highlighted that the Serb sustained \"a serious injury\" that would take time to recover.\n\n\"It's a serious injury and it won't go away tomorrow. That leaves me a bit speechless. You need your knees on grass, you really do slip all the time. A torn medial meniscus is a serious injury and the question naturally arises as to whether surgery is necessary,\" Becker said.\n\nLater on Eurosport Germany show 'Matchball Becker', Becker continued addressing the issue. Addressing the timing of Djokovic's injury, Becker acknowledged it could not come at a worse time considering that Wimbledon and the Paris Olympics were just around the corner.\n\nWhen sharing his thoughts on what would be Djokovic's next move, Becker suggested that being conservative in his treatment might not be the answer. But Becker also noted that undergoing surgery would probably leave Djokovic needing time to regain the full strength in his knee and everything that comes with it.\n\nShortly after Becker's remarks were made, it was announced that Djokovic decided to have a knee surgery on Wednesday in Paris.\n\n\"It's a serious injury, footballers often have it - and it won't be gone tomorrow. The question is: how do you treat it? Conservatively without surgery or does he have to have it treated arthroscopically?\n\n\"Wimbledon starts in four weeks, then the Olympics in six, seven weeks. That's the worst possible time to have an injury. Especially such a bad one. There will now be a lot of discussion in the Djokovic camp about what the right treatment is.\n\n\"After an operation like that, if he needs one, you're on crutches at first, then you lose muscle. It takes weeks, if not months, before you have 100% confidence in your knee again. It's a very difficult situation for Novak Djokovic.\"\n\nA few hours after it was revealed that Djokovic was undergoing surgery, Serbian media reported that the surgery was a success. According to reports, when Djokovic's knee was opened, it was revealed that he avoided a more serious meniscus injury - and since it wasn't the worst possible outcome, the Serb could need just three weeks to recover although his recovery time will also depend on some other factors.\n\nIf Djokovic manages to recover in three weeks, he could still potentially be in play to compete at Wimbledon. Also, Djokovic making it to the Paris Olympics now seems like a far better chance than it was then the surgery was initially announced.\n\nFor Djokovic, being able to play at the Paris Olympics will be extremely important as it is well-known that the 37-year-old Serb is determined to win an Olympic gold medal before retiring from tennis.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Becker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boris Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial meniscus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthroscopy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Prevention_Issues", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Prevention Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The Serbian champion yesterday afternoon managed to accomplish a real feat by beating Francisco Cerundolo in the fifth set despite a knee injury that turned out to be quite serious.\n\nIn fact, examinations showed a tear in the medial meniscus of his right knee. The big question mark now concerns Djokovic's next few months, because Wimbledon is a month away and then there will be the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nThe 37-year-old will do everything to recover in time, but arriving in the best condition for these two important dates will be really difficult for him.\n\nNovak Djokovic will have to resign himself to not spending any more weeks as world number 1 for a while. His absence from Wimbledon 2024 due to a meniscus injury will cause a significant drop in the Serbian's ATP ranking, which will lose the 1,200 points he earned last year at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, which will be deducted on July 15. It would not be out of the question that he could fall beyond the top 5 of the rankings and drop out of a fight for number 1 in which Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will be involved, with Alexander Zverev possibly joining in if the German continues to advance at Roland Garros 2024.\n\n\"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros.

He's shown that, over and over again, as recently as his last two wins at the French Open.\n\nSimilarly, it would be a mistake to write off Djokovic right now, after a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to withdraw from the clay-court tournament where he was the defending champion -- and where he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nAnd, ultimately, it would not make much sense at all to begin pondering whether this could presage the real and true end of seeing competitive tennis from any of the so-called Big Three, after Djokovic joined contemporaries and rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to claim title after title -- 66 Grand Slam trophies combined -- and spend week after week at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, of course, it had to, either due to declining skills or accumulating injuries or, simply, age. Federer was the first to say goodbye, playing his last match at Wimbledon a month shy of age 40 in 2021 -- a quarterfinal loss to Hubert Hurkacz -- and marking his retirement 15 months later with a farewell match at the Laver Cup. Nadal, 38 as of Monday, dealt with hip and abdominal problems over the past 1 1/2 years, including surgery, and is currently sitting on the only clay-court losing streak of his entire career, with a setback at the Italian Open last month -- to Hurkacz -- followed by a first round exit at Roland Garros last week. His future is unclear, although he sounded like someone who wants to try to keep competing.\n\nAs for Djokovic? First of all, it's impossible to know exactly how long he will be sidelined after getting hurt during a fourth round victory against No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo on Monday that lasted five sets spread across more than 4 1/2 hours. It was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two exceeding 9 hours, and he trailed 2-1 in sets on both occasions.\n\n\"I didn't know, to be honest,\" Djokovic said Monday night, \"whether I should continue or not.\"\n\nThe French newspaper L'Equipe reported Wednesday that Djokovic planned to have knee surgery and likely will miss Wimbledon, which he has won seven times and starts on July 1. Djokovic's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Summer Olympics, where he would love to finally collect a gold medal, starts its tennis matches on July 27 at Roland Garros.\n\nYes, he is 37. No, he hasn't won a title all season; hasn't even reached so much as one final. Yes, his unbeaten streak in Australian Open semifinals and finals ended with a loss in the final four to Jannik Sinner in January. No, he still has not decided on a permanent coach to replace Goran Ivanisevic. Yes, Djokovic will relinquish the No. 1 ranking as of next week, supplanted there by Sinner, a 22-year-old from Italy who still has a chance to win Roland Garros and get halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n\"Seeing Novak (withdraw) is, for everyone, disappointing,\" Sinner said, \"so I wish him a speedy recovery.\"\n\nThis season represents as much of a dip for Djokovic as he's had in quite some time, even if it did include a 370th Grand Slam match win, breaking a tie with Federer for the most ever. It might be Djokovic's lowest on-court period since the stretch from mid-2016 to mid-2018, when he went 24 months without a major championship and needed an operation on his right elbow.\n\nIt's instructive to recall what happened after that: Djokovic won Wimbledon in 2018, beginning a stretch in which he took home the trophy from 12 of 19 Grand Slam tournaments that he entered. That pushed his career count up to 24, the most in the sport's professional era, which began in 1968 -- two more than Nadal, four more than Federer.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the 21-year-old with two majors who is primed, along with Sinner, to take over at the top of the game, noted Djokovic's past history of returning from injuries: \"He comes back stronger and he comes back quickly.\"\n\nBe the first

June. 06, 2024 07:58. by Kyu-In Hwang kini@donga.com.\n\nNovak Djokovic (37, Serbia, world No. 1) withdrew from the quarterfinals of the French Open tennis tournament due to injury. Djokovic was scheduled to play the quarterfinals on Wednesday against Casper Ruud (26, Norway, world No. 7), whom he faced in last year's final, but forfeited the match due to pain in his right knee. Djokovic had also taken painkillers during the round of 16.\n\nThis is the first time Djokovic has withdrawn ahead of a match in any of the four major tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open). Consequently, his bid to win 25 major tournaments has been postponed. Djokovic holds the record for winning men's singles at major tournaments 24 times, including three wins at the French Open. One more victory would tie him with Margaret Court (82, Australia), who won the women's singles title 25 times.\n\nDue to his withdrawal, Djokovic also ceded the world No. 1 spot to Jannik Sinner (23, Italy, world No. 2). Sinner became the first Italian player to reach No. 1 in the world rankings. On the same day, Sinner defeated Grigor Dimitrov (33, Bulgaria, world No. 10) 3-0 (6-2, 6-4, 7-6) to advance to the semifinals.", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Court", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://dimg1.donga.com/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/66/60/ed/92/6660ed920bcbd273823e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-06-", "textStart": 53, "textEnd": 61}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

And, in the long term, what will his chances be?\n\nThere are fewer and fewer words to define the career of a legend like Novak Djokovic. The Serb, like his eternal rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, has had a devastating impact on tennis (and sports) history. Djokovic in particular has achieved impossible - perhaps irreplicable - milestones, coming to be defined as the GOAT and the strongest athlete ever. Perhaps he will not have had the same media impact that, by popular acclaim, Federer had, but, in terms of titles, numbers, data and statistics, no tennis player is like the Serb.\n\nTo rise to the divine (as I said in my recent editorial which you can find here), Djokovic would still have three major milestones to reach. But probably, at least for this year, one will escape him: Wimbledon. The injury that occurred to the legendary Serbian champion and which forced him to withdraw from the Roland Garros is more serious than expected. The Serb underwent knee surgery, which fortunately seems to have gone well, according to initial reports, but which will almost certainly force him to miss the Championships. Djokovic will attempt a possible recovery but certainly not for the Olympic Games in Paris, a tournament that the Serbian has never won and his great goal of the season.\n\nYesterday, Djokovic announced his withdrawal from the Roland Garros, thus giving up the chance to reach the semifinals to the Norwegian Casper Ruud and being ousted from the throne of men's tennis by the new ATP No.1 Jannik Sinner.\n\n\"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros. I played with my heart and gave my all but I have to withdraw due to a torn medial meniscus in my right knee,\" said Nole.\n\nAs the Serbian media reported, surgery was the most logical choice to speed up the healing process. Now Nole will have to sit out at least four weeks. Theoretically Djokovic could try to play Wimbledon but he would risk a lot, especially in view of the Olympics. Barring sensational twists, the tennis player will therefore work directly for the Olympics and.\n\nThe Serbian physiotherapist Dobrosav Melajac meanwhile reassured fans in an interview for SportKlub: \"It is not realistic that Nole is ready for Wimbledon, especially given the change to the grass surface and he would certainly take risks.\n\nInstead, I think Djokovic has all the time he needs to prepare for the 2024 Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe real question, however, is: given such a difficult 2024, the 37 years of age and the knee injury, will Djokovic be able to return to the levels expressed - for example - in his unforgettable 2023?\n\nI answer this question by saying: yes, he can do it. Age advances, physical problems increase, but Djokovic has taken care of his body obsessively over the years. In retrospect we can say that perhaps this is the most serious injury of his career. Until the knee problem, the difficulties shown by Nole in 2024 seemed more motivational than physical. It is clear that the urge to play Paris Olimpica will be strong for the Serbian champion. But then (especially if the result was an Olympic gold medal), the Serbian could remodulate, reduce and reprogram his schedule, even thinking about 2025. He is certainly at a crossroads, but the path he will take will be that of a come back and not that of the end\n\nThe Serbian tennis player had already explained the nature of the knee problem at the press conference after the win against Cerundolo.\n\n\"I asked for physiotherapy because I was in pain. This affected my game. For two sets I didn't want to participate in many rallies. If he made drop shots or changes of direction, I didn't feel comfortable in the exchange. At a certain point I wondered whether to continue playing or not, given what was happening. After the third set I asked for more medicine. I took the maximum dose I could take and started feeling the effects in the fourth set. I felt fewer limitations in my movements. In the fifth set I played without pain, but the effect of the drugs doesn't last forever, so we'll see. I'll do some tests tomorrow. I have played other tournaments with torn muscles in the past.\n\nThe adrenaline we feel also helps us. The positive aspect of a Slam is that you have a day of rest between matches, and this can help recovery. I don't know what will happen tomorrow. I don't know if I will be able to play on Wednesday.\n\nI hope so. Due to the climate, this year's conditions are a bit special. There has been a lot of rain, very heavy, and this affects the terrain. This is a living surface, like grass. The earth can be treated, not like grass. Roland Garros is the tournament that treats clay best, without a doubt. I think today's sun affected the clay in some way. I don't know what they did, but it seems like they took something out of the clay that isn't present on the court. My injury happened because, due to this, the ground becomes very slippery.\n\nI have a very aggressive movement, with very sudden changes in direction. The number of slips I had today was excessive. I asked the chair umpire if they could sweep the court more. Maybe not every exchange, but every two or three. I was told no. They asked the supervisor and he also refused. I don't want to point fingers, I'm just trying to figure out what the problem is with sweeping the court more often. It doesn't hurt anyone. It would be a good thing for the players, putting more dirt and sweeping more.

The Serbian defied fate and refused to lose again, overcoming Francisco Cerundolo and, above all, his physical problems.\n\nThe Serbian champion dominated the first set in every way, but at the start of the second a knee problem - perhaps already evident in the previous match - prevented him from competing at his best. It was the resilience that only belongs to phenomena that gave Djokovic a hand, who with another heroic comeback earned access to the quarterfinals of Roland Garros and added two more incredible records to his collection.\n\nNo one has won more matches and reached more quarterfinals than him in a Slam: in both cases he outdistanced Roger Federer, reaching 370 on one side and 59 on the other.\n\nNovak Djokovic made bad weather and took a 1-0 lead quickly and without suffering.\n\nIn the second set, however, the pain in his knee intensified and Djokovic was forced to request a medical time out. From that moment, the match changed face and the 37-year-old cancelled out two break points at 1-2, four at 2-3 and one at 3-4 relying on his serve and extemporaneous solutions such as serve & volley.\n\nCerundolo wavered until the twelfth game: Djokovic missed a forehand on the second set point offered to his rival. In the third, the Serbian immediately went behind and never threatened on the return, taking a painful 3-6.\n\nThe tension devoured Cerundolo who, ahead by a break in the fourth set, allowed Djokovic to come back and, after having wasted a break point, lost his serve again at 5-6. The Serb smelled blood and tried in every way to draw energy from every situation.\n\nCerundolo recovered the break of disadvantage in the decisive set, but Djokovic made his voice heard on 4-3 giving his all and hitting a magnificent backhand on the counterattack that ended on the line. The match ended 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.\n\nFrancisco Cer\u00fandolo was close to giving the big surprise of this Roland Garros 2024 when he was two games away from beating Novak Djokovic. However, the Serbian, who had been hurting from the knee since the second set, rose from the ashes to come back in a real match.\n\nAnd he did not hesitate to praise the number one in a press conference. \"He really is the toughest guy who has ever played tennis. It was a great battle. He always finds a way to come back and play his best tennis in the most difficult moments and at the end of each match.\n\nSo yes, it is what it is. I did everything I could.

into Beijing.\n\nAnd the third seed impressed on his way to the last four, dropping just one set on his way to the semi-final - to Gael Monfils in their quarter-final clash.\n\nDjokovic faced a tough semi-final against world No 2 Rafael Nadal and, despite taking the second set, missed out on the gold medal match after a 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 loss.\n\nHowever, he bounced back to take the bronze medal, beating US ace and eighth seed James Blake 6-3, 7-6(4).\n\nHe also played in the men's doubles alongside close confidant Nenad Zimonjic, the second seeds suffering a shock opening defeat to Czechia's Martin Damm and Pavel Vizner.\n\nWhy Novak Djokovic could miss Wimbledon and the Olympics after French Open injury blow\n\nDjokovic was again one of the favourites for gold at London 2012, with the world No 2 having won the Australian Open and reached the French Open final that season.\n\nThe Serbian did not have an easy time of it early on, needing three sets to beat Fabio Fognini and Lleyton Hewitt in round one and round three respectively, but then beat fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in straight sets to reach the last four.\n\nHe was perhaps the favourite for his semi-final against third seed Andy Murray but, buoyed by home support, Murray stunned the Serbian 7-5, 7-5 to deny Djokovic a showdown against Roger Federer.\n\nAnd there was to be no medal for him this time, losing 7-5, 6-4 to Juan Martin del Potro in the bronze match.\n\nDjokovic also played doubles alongside Viktor Troicki, the eighth seeds losing in round one two Johan Brunstrom and Robert Lindstedt.\n\nWorld No 1 and reigning champion at three of the four majors, Djokovic was the heavy favourite to finally take gold at Rio 2016.\n\nBut there was to be more disappointment for the 24-time Slam winner, handed a nightmare opening match against del Potro, who started his resurgence with a shock 7-6(4), 7-6(2) triumph.\n\nDjokovic again also played doubles in Rio, back alongside Zimonjic, with the pair reaching round two before a loss to third seeds and home favourites Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares.\n\nHaving won the first three Slams of 2021, Djokovic was again the overwhelming favourite for gold at the delayed Tokyo Games, with all eyes on whether he could complete the 'Golden Calender Slam'.\n\nThe world No 1 dominated throughout the early stages of the tournament, and a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Kei Nishikori in the last eight saw him storm into the semi-finals.\n\nHowever, for the third time in his career, he was defeated at that stage, fading badly in a surprise 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 loss to eventual winner and fourth seed Alexander Zverev.\n\nHe was also the wrong side of a surprise result in the bronze medal match, beaten 6-4, 6-7(6), 6-3 by sixth seed Pablo Carreno Busta.\n\nSkipping men's doubles action, Djokovic played mixed alongside Nina Stojanovic, the pair reaching the last four.\n\nBut they were beaten in two tight sets by Russians Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina in the semi-final, and he withdrew from the bronze medal match to prioritise his singles campaign - a decision that backfired.\n\nNovak Djokovic breaks silence after undergoing surgery as he makes statement on his tennis future\n\nThe nature of Djokovic's injury means that doubts now circle over whether he will get one final shot at Olympic success this summer.\n\nHe is almost certain to miss Wimbledon due to the recovery time, but may well skip the event even if he does recover quickly to focus on his Olympic campaign.\n\nAll eyes will now be on whether he returns to Roland Garros this July.",

Novak Djokovic adds another piece to his now indescribable career, and he does it with that characteristic that has always distinguished him: the ability to never give up.\n\nHis performance in the round of 16 at Roland Garros against Francisco Cerundolo was a demonstration of the fact that even at 37 years old and in precarious physical condition, to beat the Serbian tennis player you have to go beyond your possibilities.\n\nGiving 100% is not enough. Asking the Argentine, who from the counter break suffered in the fourth set saw all his certainties slowly crumble, seeing an achievement that would have been unforgettable for him slip away. A battle of over four and a half hours ended 6-1 5-7 3-6 7-5 6-3 in favor of the world number one, with Djokovic making a pair with the amazing comeback he staged against Lorenzo Musetti in the following round.\n\nThe knee problem, however, is keeping fans and the Serbian champion himself in suspense, and he revealed his condition in a press conference ahead of his next match.\n\n24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic explained to reporters that he had been suffering from a knee problem for a few weeks, which worsened with a slip in the second set.\n\n\"I had some small problems with my knee for a few weeks, but nothing serious. Then I slipped in the 2nd set and felt pain. I took a lot of painkillers and they started to take effect at the end of the fourth set,\" revealed the world number one.\n\nThe intervention of the physiotherapist of the French tournament and the painkillers taken at the end of the third set reduced the pain, but Nole's real conditions will only be discovered in the coming days. In fact, the 37-year-old declared that he does not yet know if he will take part in the next match.\n\n\"I don't know if I will play the quarterfinals, we will wait and see,\" concluded Djokovic. Francisco Cer\u00fandolo was close to giving the big surprise of this Roland Garros 2024 when he was two games away from beating Novak Djokovic.\n\nHowever, the Serbian, who had been hurting from the knee since the second set, rose from the ashes to come back in a real match. And he did not hesitate to praise the number one in a press conference. \"He really is the toughest guy who has ever played tennis.\n\nIt was a great battle. He always finds a way to come back and play his best tennis in the most difficult moments and at the end of each match. So yes, it is what it is. I did everything I could. I was very close, but I couldn't win it. He has shown again why he is the best,\" said a resigned Cer\u00fandolo.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149564.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Wimbledon is not that far away, the Olympics are coming up and he has stated his desire to try and win there.\n\n\"A meniscus... that doesn't heal quickly, so I would not be surprised if he is out of Wimbledon.

Tennis is also an expensive sport, so having a tournament like this in your backyard is invaluable as it drastically reduces travel costs.\n\n\"Competition is so important to any tennis player and we need to get as many quality tournaments in South Africa as possible to allow our players to test themselves and go to the next level.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_palmer@tennis365.com", "name": "Kevin Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Koenig", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Koenig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medial meniscus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F05205040%2FScreenshot.2024.06.05.at_.20.49.10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

For almost two decades at Roland Garros, he has been the right man at the wrong time.\n\nIn the entire history of tennis, there has been one better male clay-court player than Djokovic: Rafael Nadal, who has won 14 French Open titles, and 63 ATP Tour events on clay in total.\n\nThree-time French Open champion Mats Wilander puts Djokovic and Bjorn Borg, who won six men's titles at Roland Garros in eight years between 1974 and 1981, level behind the Spaniard.\n\n\"I would rank it Nadal, and then Borg and Djokovic joint-second,\" said Wilander, who is covering this year's French Open for broadcaster Eurosport, in a conversation on Monday night. \"Djokovic won three here when Nadal was pretty much unbeatable. I can't put him past Borg, because he won six times, but I'd put him joint-second to Rafa.\"\n\nWere it not for Nadal, Djokovic would surely have a lot more than those three French Open titles. Nadal has beaten him here eight times, in two quarterfinals, three semis and three finals.\n\nAnd now, with an injured Nadal finally out of the way, potentially for good, and the rest of the field inexperienced in the art of winning a Grand Slam, Djokovic's body has failed him too.\n\nA heroic five-set win over Francisco Cerundolo on Monday, which initially put him into what would have been an 18th Paris quarterfinal, instead sent him out of the tournament with a torn meniscus in his right knee. Casper Ruud, his would-be opponent, got a free pass to the semifinals, and Djokovic's chance to get a different kind of closure at Roland Garros -- an Olympic gold medal, which he has craved for so long -- is in doubt.\n\nHis 17 quarterfinals have translated into three titles, which is still an outstanding record.\n\nOnly two male players have won more French Opens than Djokovic since the Second World War. Borg has his six, the last of which was 43 years ago, and Nadal has his preposterous 14. Three others have also won three -- Wilander, Ivan Lendl and Gustavo Kuerten. Some of the most renowned male players in the world, including Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras and Andy Murray, all multiple Grand Slam champions, have never won at Roland Garros.\n\nA fourth would have rubber-stamped Djokovic's superiority over his fellow three-timers, but the fact that he won his titles in the era of Nadal gives him the edge in most eyes anyway, including those of Wilander himself.\n\nThere was even a French Open where Djokovic beat Nadal, and still didn't win the title.\n\nThat was in 2015, when it felt like he was cursed to never be champion at Roland Garros, the one major that eluded him in his desperate quest to complete the career Grand Slam. Djokovic's semi-final against Murray went to five sets and, in those days before Court Philippe-Chatrier had a roof, had to be played over two days, meaning he had no day off before playing Stanislas Wawrinka in the final. Djokovic eventually ran out of steam and lost to Wawrinka in four sets, having won the first.\n\nThe following year, Djokovic returned to finally win the title, but doing so and completing the career Grand Slam contributed to a mental and physical letdown that saw him not win another major for two years -- a lifetime in Novak-land.\n\nEven with these misfortunes, Djokovic is still the only thing resembling a rival Nadal has had at Roland Garros. He is responsible for half of the Mallorcan's four career defeats at the French Open, and until last week -- which carries an asterisk, given Nadal's physical condition -- was the only man to beat him here in straight sets. Djokovic would be forgiven for feeling frustrated that just as Nadal is bowing out, he too, having turned 37 last month, is not fit enough to compete for this year's title.\n\nWhatever happens from here on in, when you throw in six Italian Opens, three titles in Madrid and two in Monte Carlo, it's clear Djokovic is an elite, would-be generational clay-court player. \"A clay-court monster,\" as Gael Monfils put it to The Athletic last month.\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas, who lost to Djokovic in the 2021 French Open final, agrees. \"With clay, you always think of Rafa as the dominant one, but Novak I think is not talked about enough on clay,\" he said on Monday night. \"He is definitely one of the best competitors and fighters on clay. I think he's done incredible things on the surface -- especially in the Rafa era, when he was able to beat him here and in other tournaments.\"\n\nDjokovic and clay isn't something we hear about much, and as Tsitsipas says, the Nadal factor is a big part of this -- who cares about three measly titles when there's a guy who has 14? There's also the fact that Djokovic has been much more successful on other surfaces. He has won 10 Australian Opens and seven Wimbledons, and his winning percentage on outdoor hard courts (85 per cent) and on grass (86 per cent) outstrips his, still hugely impressive, 80 per cent on clay. The man himself is aware that it's not where he is at his best.\n\n\"Although I grew up on clay, it is not my favourite surface. I like to play on hard, then on grass, and then only on clay,\" he said in 2021. \"Clay is the kind of surface where it is unpredictable, and sometimes for my style of play, tempo, and rhythm it can be quite challenging.\"\n\nRuud, the man he should have been facing on Wednesday and the opponent he beat in last year's final, was plain about the nature of Djokovic's unfulfilled destiny at Roland Garros: \"You can definitely argue that Novak is the second-best clay court player of all time. I mean, obviously, Borg has more titles here than him, but Novak was always close, he always pretty much reached the final and ended up losing to Rafa.\"\n\nThat this is the consensus in the locker room has been underlined by similar sentiments from many other players over the past few days -- including No 13 seed Holger Rune, who missed out on a quarterfinals place in a defeat to No 4 seed Alexander Zverev. Rune said: \"If Rafa wasn't here, Novak would be the best clay court player. He's won three French Opens, which is amazing.\"\n\nIn tennis, being second-best means losing. So how does the second-best male clay-court player of all time build such a redoubtable legacy?\n\nAll players adjust to the surface they are playing on, but there are qualities that the best players possess that are universally effective. The homogenisation of the sport's three main surfaces over the last 20 or so years -- grass getting slower; clay getting faster -- has also helped players dominate across all three surfaces. Witness the three male players with the most Grand Slam titles all doing so in this period.\n\nWhile Djokovic is his best self on hard courts, he's still almost peerless on clay.\n\nTennis Data Innovations' (TDI) overall Performance Rating takes into account the player's shot quality, the percentage of shots they play in attack, and their efficiency in both attack (conversion score) and defence (steal score). It has Djokovic as by far the best player on hard courts (leading second place by 0.46) and ranks him second for clay (just 0.15 behind the leader, Zverev), based on his past two years of performance on the surfaces in ATP tournaments.\n\nEven if the general makeup of his game -- the flat forehand, the rock-solid backhand -- makes him the archetypal hard-court player, he has qualities that are very well-suited to clay.\n\nOne is his durability.\n\nJust ask Carlos Alcaraz, who fell away after two gruelling sets against Djokovic in last year's semi-final here. Alcaraz won the second set but then started suffering badly from cramp and ended up losing both the third and fourth sets 6-1, saying that the cramps were occasioned less by physical punishment, and more the intense mental pressure of facing Djokovic on the red stuff.\n\n\"He's really tough on every surface, but here on clay he puts so much pressure on you in every point,\" says Alcaraz. \"In every point -- the first point to the last one you have to play long rallies, like seven, eight, nine balls. Every rally, you have to be at your best level.\n\n\"Last year I couldn't finish the match at my 100 per cent because, after just two sets, I was down on intensity. For him, it was normal.\"\n\nDjokovic's physicality and defensive skills are born out by the numbers. Steal score, which is how TDI measures how often a player has won the point when they are in defence, puts Djokovic at 38 per cent on clay courts compared to 36 per cent on hard. Both figures are significantly above the tour average for the previous 52 weeks on all surfaces, which is 34 per cent.\n\nWe saw this in action in Djokovic's final couple of matches at Roland Garros this year.\n\nAgainst 30th seed Lorenzo Musetti at the weekend, Djokovic earned himself three set points in the fourth set with some outstanding defence that ended with a devastating angled backhand. To achieve the decisive break of serve in the fifth set against No 23 seed Cerundolo, meanwhile, he clung on in the game by winning a point he looked out of on several occasions before somehow stealing it when his opponent was hustled into an error. Earlier, he rescued a terrific passing shot with a flying volley (while playing on one functioning knee).\n\n\"I had to hit my best shot every single time,\" a rueful Cerundolo said afterwards. \"If you don't hit well, he (will) crush you.\"\n\nMichael Chang, the 1989 French Open champion (and he of the underarm serve heard around the world), says that Djokovic's physicality and defensive skills have been especially useful on clay, which he feels is \"the most different and most demanding of all the surfaces.\"\n\n\"The French Open is, by far, on the men's side the most physically demanding tournament of the year. You can play unbelievable tennis but if you're not in shape for a two-week tournament, you'll come up short,\" Chang says.\n\nChang was speaking to The Athletic on Monday, before Djokovic suffered his tournament-ending knee injury, and his words feel even more pertinent now.\n\nAs well as staying in rallies even more effectively on clay, the dirt also allows him to exploit his gift as the greatest returner in the history of the sport.\n\nHis percentage of service games won is at its lowest on clay, but his return hits its highest games won percentage on the same surface. He also uses speed, spin, and depth more effectively when returning on clay, partnering with the natural qualities of the surface to neutralise his opponents and get them into rallies where he will be favourite.\n\n\"The return on clay makes you feel a lot of pressure, because his ball comes back so hard and deep at you,\" says world No 18 Karen Khachanov, who Djokovic beat in last year's French Open quarterfinal and in the fourth round here in 2020.\n\nOne of Djokovic's great skills on clay is his ability to adapt. His game, built on that rock-solid backhand and an angular but relatively flat forehand, is perfect for hard courts. Thriving on clay means making tweaks.\n\n\"You see Novak every day on a hard court -- he hits a clean ball, not too much topspin. Not too fast. Which then makes him a complete animal to be able to win on clay,\" says Wilander, who won seven Grand Slams in all. \"The fact he keeps doing this over and over again is why I put him up there with Borg on clay.\"\n\nWilander says that Djokovic's ability to morph his forehand to suit the surface he's playing on is crucial.\n\n\"On grass he hits it flatter, so on clay the spin comes sort of out of nowhere and there's a lot of surprise, whereas Nadal hits it (his forehand) like that all the time. Novak only does it when he feels like he has the upper hand, and when he adds that kind of spin, the opponent goes, 'Woah, where did that come from?'.\"\n\nThat ability to change his game is his greatness, Wilander says, on clay and across the board, and Djokovic's completeness is exemplified by him being the only male player to have won all four Grand Slams a minimum of three times each.\n\nDjokovic's peers, who have struggled to master all of the sport's surfaces, are in awe of his versatility and adaptability. Grigor Dimitrov, the No 10 seed who finally made his first Roland Garros quarterfinal this year at the 14th attempt, says: \"He's one of the very few players that have been able to adapt to any surface and any changes over the years.\"\n\nWorld No 5 Daniil Medvedev, who has a love-hate relationship with clay, adds: \"Novak's game is more suited for grass and hard courts, but he's an amazing player on every surface. That's where I find Novak amazing. Even if his game might have been a bit more vulnerable (on clay), he still wins three (at) Roland Garros.\"\n\n\"What is impressive with Novak is his incredible ability to switch surfaces and still play with the same kind of amazing consistency, not looking like he lacks anything,\" Tsitsipas says. \"I really feel like that's the goal for us (other players) to aim towards.\"\n\nBecause of his injury, Djokovic won't get the chance to move clear of Wilander, Kuerten and Lendl and to within two of Borg in the final on Sunday -- but if he returns to tennis in time for the Olympics, he will have at least one more shot at closure on the courts of Roland Garros.\n\nThe 2024 French Open will ultimately go down as another tale of woe for the Serbian, but to have achieved all he has on clay in the era of Nadal will go down as one of his biggest career achievements -- even if, on this surface, the biggest winner in men's tennis history came out second-best.", "source": {"uri":

Novak shared positive news with his fans following a tough decision, updating his fans and saying everything went well. Djokovic thanked the team of doctors and his fans, who have been by his side at a challenging moment.\n\nThe 24-time Major winner will do his best to recover and return to action as soon as possible, highlighting his desire to regain his A-game and chase notable titles again at 37. Novak is yet to reach an ATP final in 2024, failing to repeat his incredible run from last year.\n\nThe veteran came to Paris with a right knee issue (medial meniscus), which only worsened following back-to-back five-setters.\n\nDjokovic prevailed but decided to withdraw and undergo a meniscus surgery the next day, eager to return to 100% for the Olympic Games.\n\nNovak should recover in three weeks and return to the practice court. He will likely skip Wimbledon, but another trip to Paris in July for the Olympic Games seems doable. Djokovic will do everything to prepare for the Olympic Games and chase the elusive gold medal in the national jersey.\n\nNovak did not like the conditions on Court Philippe-Chatrier against Lorenzo Musetti and Francisco Cerundolo. He endured those tests but paid a high price, not risking anything ahead of the most important tournament of the season!\n\nDjokovic ousted Musetti with a bagel in the decider at 3:06 am, hoping to recover for the next duel two days later.\n\nNovak made a reliable start against Francisco before slipping in the second set, blasting the organizers and blaming the court and the lack of clay.\n\nWorld no. 1 urged the officials to sweep the court more frequently and repair the troubled spots, which they refused without a valid reason. The Serb took a medical timeout and a couple of massages, doing his best to stay competitive.\n\nNovak felt better after taking the painkillers, raising his level from the second part of the fourth set and coming from the verge of defeat. The Argentine grabbed the fourth set in the closing stages and took charge in the third, outplaying world no.\n\n1 on serve and return and moving closer to a stunner.\n\nFrancisco opened a 4-2 lead in the fourth set, looking good to send troubled Novak packing.\n\nHowever, the Serb found inner strength again, combining it with painkillers and preparing a notable comeback. Djokovic broke back, denied a break point at 5-5 and clinched the set with another break in game 12. They went into a decider after nearly three hours and 50 minutes and traded breaks in games two and three.\n\nNovak took another fall in the fourth game but kept his composure. He grabbed a crucial break in the eighth game and held at 15 in the next one for a notable win, his last in Paris this year.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jovica_ilic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Jovica Ilic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_meniscus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medial meniscus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bagel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149729.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

His goal is obviously the Paris Olympics. It will be tough to get back in competitive time for Wimbledon. The Serbian's presence in London would be equivalent to an early comeback, with the consequent risk of exposing himself to new injuries that would undermine his presence at the Olympic tournament.\n\nYesterday, Nole officially underwent surgery. The Serbian champion decided not to wait and proceed immediately with surgery, so that he can achieve an immediate recovery. After the match against Cerundolo which Nole managed to win despite his physical problems, the Serbian tennis player underwent instrumental tests which highlighted the injury. Djokovic will now be out of action for about three or four weeks and will almost certainly miss the next Wimbledon tournament to be ready for the Olympics, a great goal of the season and the only trophy missing from the tennis player's immense collection.\n\nFor Djokovic, a race against time begins, to be ready for the Olympic tournament in Paris. It won't be easy at all. Srugery, the stop, resuming training with caution. Winning the gold medal will be almost a mission impossible but the only one who can do it is Djokovic.

It is a great disappointment for all tennis lovers not to be able to admire him in the semifinals.\"\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, at the end of the match with Stefanos Tsitsipas, wanted to dedicate a beautiful message to Novak Djokovic, in the press conference. The young Spaniard's hope is to see the Serbian champion back on the court and at his maximum level, underlining how Nole's absence from the Roland Garros semi-final was a bitter disappointment for all tennis fans. Djokovic had to give up the quarter-final against Casper Ruud. A painful and sad decision, but necessary due to the severity of the knee injury, which forced him to undergo surgery.\n\nThe Serbian champion won two tough matches in the fifth set against Lorenzo Musetti and Francisco Cerundolo, respectively in the 3rd and 4th rounds of the Parisian Major. In the latter case, however, a slip worsened the knee problem which turned into a rather serious injury. The hope is to see Djokovic back on the court already at Wimbledon, but everything will depend on the path he decides to follow to resolve the situation. Giving up the London Slam and, above all, the Paris 2024 Olympic Games would be a hard blow for the Belgrade native to digest.\n\n\"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros. I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday's match and unfortunately, due to a tear in the medial meniscus of my right knee, my team and I have had to make a difficult decision after careful consideration and analysis.

In the press conference he then said that he had a resentment to a problem already suffered in recent days and that the fall simply exacerbated the case.\n\nIn addition to this, Djokovic - on several occasions during the match - argued with the chair umpire and the supervisor, guilty of not underlining the conditions of a court in his opinion dilapidated or almost. During the match, Djokovic asked for the court to be swept several times, also to avoid putting the safety of the tennis players at risk.\n\nMany times at the change of court world number one Novak Djokovic has joked, underlining (in an ironic way) the excellent conditions of the court.\n\nIn short, in addition to the opponents and the physical problems, also the court and the supervisor, at 37 years old Djokovic no longer stops and tries to achieve the best possible result. The tennis player from Belgrade remains in the fight for the number one position in the world that he defends from the attack of Jannik Sinner.\n\nTomorrow he will face the Norwegian Casper Ruud, a tennis player who he has often beaten in his career but who recently defeated him at the Masters 1000 in Monte-Carlo.

It's a black eye for our sport.\n\n\"It doesn't shine too good a light on the schedule, which was a joke that they put him out at 10.30pm on Saturday.\n\n\"He'd talked about the knee issue before the tournament. That couldn't have helped.\n\n\"And it goes to three in the morning -- absurd!\n\n\"If this doesn't change the mentality of the Majors about this type of scheduling, I don't know what will. He's the No.1 player in the world.\n\n\"An all-time great, maybe the greatest. He got hurt and that contributed to it.\n\n\"Having to play to three in the morning, you cannot say that didn't have an effect on his body, his system, his recovery.\n\n\"What time did he go to bed? 7am? How much sleep did he get? It's not good for our sport. That's a bad look.\n\n\"Does LeBron James play in the NBA Finals at three in the morning? It's absurd.\n\n\"There was a lot of rain and they were trying to catch up but they didn't need to play Grigor Dimitrov's match before Djokovic's. I don't know what they were thinking.\n\n\"I don't know why they'll listen to me now -- they haven't listened for the past 45 years!\n\n\"What I say is what I believe is best for the sport. This needs to change.\n\n\"I hope the players get a fifteenth more money out of the overall package. They should be partners with the Majors. Not hired guns.\n\n\"Start the night matches earlier. Start at 7pm. Too often, ultimately in my opinion, tennis shoots itself in the foot.\"\n\nRecovery on this type of issue is normally between three to six weeks and that means Djokovic is essentially ruled out of the Championships, which start on July 1.\n\nIf all goes well, he will hope to be fit enough to win Olympic gold at Roland Garros -- the competition starts on July 27.\n\nMcEnroe, working for discovery+ in Paris, hopes Djokovic is not on the slide and will return to full form this summer.\n\nHe added: \"I had a couple of meniscus tears recently. I didn't have surgery.\n\n\"It depends on the severity. It could be two to three weeks or seven to eight weeks out.\n\n\"We are all hoping that Novak plays and is ready to go.

Novak Djokovic's uncertain future", "body": "Novak Djokovic, a titan in the world of tennis and arguably the greatest player the sport has ever seen, has withdrawn from the French Open due to a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. This abrupt exit not only halts his title defence but could also mark his final days as a professional.\n\nDjokovic's announcement on social media was a poignant moment for tennis fans worldwide. \"I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from #rolandgarros,\" he said, revealing the severity of his condition after a gruelling four-and-a-half-hour match against No 23 Francisco Cerundolo.\n\nIt was his second consecutive five-setter, with his total time on court across the two matches exceeding nine hours. The MRI results confirmed what many feared: the relentless demands of professional tennis had finally taken a toll on the 37-year-old's body.\n\nFor years, Djokovic has been a polarising figure in tennis. His on-court demeanour, characterised by intensity and occasional confrontations, has often sparked controversy. Yet, regardless of the debates surrounding his personality, his extraordinary talent and dogged pursuit of excellence have commanded respect and admiration. His 24 Grand Slam titles are the most by a man (Roger Federer 20, Rafael Nadal 22) and are a testament to his unparalleled skill and unwavering determination.\n\nDespite the controversies, Djokovic's presence on the court has been nothing short of mesmerising. His ability to claw back from the brink of defeat, as demonstrated in his latest match against Cerundolo, has awed fans and critics alike. His performance was a masterclass in resilience and skill, as he fought through the pain and uncertainty to secure a victory that would ultimately be his last in this year's French Open.\n\nHowever, the signs of wear and tear have been increasingly evident. This season, Djokovic's performance has been uncharacteristically inconsistent, with an 18-6 record and no tournament victories. His withdrawal from Roland Garros could signal the beginning of the end for one of tennis' most illustrious careers. With Wimbledon and the Paris Olympics on the horizon, the uncertainty surrounding Djokovic's future looms large.\n\nMen's tennis has been dominated by the \"Big Three\" - Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer - for nearly two decades. With Federer retired and Nadal grappling with injury struggles, Djokovic's recent setback leaves a significant void in the sport. The next generation of players, led by the likes of Jannik Sinner and Casper Ruud, now have an opportunity to step into the spotlight, but the shadow of the Big Three will linger.\n\nDjokovic's legacy, however, is firmly cemented. His 370 Grand Slam match victories, a record-breaking feat surpassing Federer, and his numerous weeks at world No 1 are milestones that may never be surpassed. His tenacity and strategic brilliance on the court have set a benchmark for future generations.\n\nAs we witness the twilight of Djokovic's career, it is imperative to acknowledge his accomplishments and profound impact on the sport. His journey has been one of unparalleled success, interspersed with moments of controversy, but always defined by his exceptional talent and unyielding spirit.\n\nWhether this marks the end or merely a pause in his legendary career, Djokovic's contributions to tennis will remain indelible.

The withdrawal also cost him the world No. 1 ranking, which now belongs to Italian Jannik Sinner starting Monday.\n\nMcEnroe blamed the tournament's scheduling decision involving Djokovic's third-round match with Lorenzo Musetti on Saturday for the injury. In an effort to keep the tournament's scheduling on the right track following a messy first week due to rain, organizers decided to shift an unfinished third-round match between Grigor Dimitrov and Zizou Bergs to Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe match got underway at around 8 p.m. local time in Paris, which was when the Djokovic-Musetti match was originally supposed to start on the same court. This led to an almost three-hour delay to the Serb's match. The 24-time Grand Slam winner eventually sealed his thrilling five-set comeback win over the Italian after 3 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n\"Putting Djokovic, 37, on the court at 10:30 p.m. (against Musetti in the third round), without knowing how long his match would last, was a huge mistake on the part of the organization,\" McEnroe told Le Figaro. \"The weather was very bad, and they were in a difficult situation. I understand that they wanted to catch up, but there were other solutions to finish the other match (Bergs vs Dimitrov).\"\n\nMcEnroe, who is broadcasting the tournament for NBC and Peacock, said it was not the proper way to treat a player of Djokovic's stature.\n\n\"Novak had been bothered by his knee for a few weeks,\" he said. \"He had to fall asleep at 7 a.m. and come back to play a day and a half later (against Cerundolo in the fourth round). It's a challenge for anyone. He had to fight five sets again, it's too much to ask. Even for Novak. If we can't say for sure, it's one of the reasons why he injured his knee. In any case, you don't treat a player, and even less the best in the world, that way.\"\n\nCoco Gauff, the top-ranked American woman who will face world No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the semifinals Thursday, agreed with McEnroe's analysis.\n\n\"I think it (Djokovic's injury and subsequent withdrawal) probably came just from the late start (against Musetti),\" she said after her quarterfinal win over Ons Jabeur. \"And it was unfortunate that he had to, you know, the matches went five sets back to back. So I think it was just a combination of those two things.\"\n\nWith Djokovic and Rafael Nadal now out of the tournament, it will mark just the second time in 20 years that the men's final will not include either legend.

It's a case of saying so. After last night's marathon in which he emerged victorious against our Lorenzo Musetti, the Serbian champion did it once again, and came out of a match that seemed sealed. This time it was the Argentine Francisco Cerundolo who succumbed, forcing the world number one to work overtime again, but he failed to eliminate him from the Slam where he is the reigning champion.\n\nNole is in the quarterfinals of Roland Garros. For him, 370 career victories in the four most coveted and prestigious tournaments in the world. Extraordinary numbers that certify the immense greatness of the 37-year-old from Belgrade.\n\nThanks to this success, the 24-time Slam champion has definitively overtaken Roger Federer, stuck at 369.

Just to name a few, Rafael Nadal (314), Jimmy Connors (233), Andre Agassi (224).\n\nNo one has reached more quarterfinals than Novak Djokovic in a Slam. Once again, Federer paid the price, having been overtaken by Djokovic, who reached 59.\n\nAt the end of the match, the Balkan record-man, exhausted but very happy, wanted to thank the crowd that pushed him into yet another feat: \"I have to thank you very much. The victory belongs to the crowd, I had to come back from two sets down in the last match, but you gave me all this energy again.\n\nI was one step away from losing this match\", said Djoker, before turning to his opponent today: \"I also want to congratulate Cer\u00fandolo on his great match, which deserved more\", he said. During a recent interview with France Television, WTA legend Justine Henin spoke about Nole Djokovic: \"He once again found the means to come back from nowhere and this is really from nowhere.\n\nWe thought that this match might have been over. We keep in the back of our minds this ability of Djokovic to rise from the ashes,\" Henin was quoted as saying on France Television. \"He's done it so many times but today we saw him struggling, unable to react.\n\nHis start left us with a lot of doubts so some had fears about his motivation at Roland\u2010Garros. He still seems determined to go further,\" Justine Henin said.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simone_brugnoli@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Simone Brugnoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Cer\u00fandolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Cer\u00fandolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Musetti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Musetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Connors", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Connors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_T\u00e9l\u00e9visions", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Television", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Television", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Players", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149515.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627463", "eventUri": "eng-9627463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Although he seemed prepared to take on Francisco again in the future, Novak admitted to a group of reporters that his knee was in pain. According to CNN, Novak admitted the pain only subsided toward the end of the match after taking medication.\n\n\"At one point, I didn't know, to be honest, whether I should continue or not with what's happening,\" Novak told reporters, according to the outlet. He also pointed out that he started feeling \"slight discomfort\" in his knee before the tournament. However, the tennis pro added that it wasn't \"an injury that would be concerning me at all.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Novak revealed that the significant amount of rain in Paris caused him to slip \"way too many times,\" likely aggravating the injury.\n\n\"I've slipped and fallen on the clay many times in my life, and on grass as well, but this was just too many times today,\" Novak explained to the press. \"Could this injury have been prevented? Possibly, if there was just a little bit more frequent care of the court during the set.

There's now a good chance he'll miss Wimbledon, which begins at the start of the next month after he decided to get the tear surgically repaired.\n\nIncredibly, it marks just the second surgical procedure of his lengthy, illustrious career, and his first since 2018 when he corrected a recurring elbow problem. The injury had been causing him pain for nearly two years, and after a five-month lay-off failed to mend it, he had no other option but to get surgery.\n\nHowever, this presented something of a moral dilemma for the Serbian, who, as demonstrated by his refusal to take the Covid-19 vaccine, is a fierce body autonomy advocate. As such, he prefers to let his body heal naturally, rather than use drugs and surgical procedures.\n\nBut after having his hand forced, he went under the knife. His mother, Dijana, accompanied him to the hospital and explained that her son felt a sense of disappointment after waking up from the anaesthesia.\n\n\"He told me that he had betrayed himself,\" she told Sportal Blic. \"I explained to him that he did what he had to do and that if he wanted to continue playing, it was necessary. He tried alternative methods, and everything available to him, but nothing worked.\n\n\"Novak is simply against [surgery]. He doesn't like drugs, he doesn't like to take anything into his body. He is curious, he reads everything he can get his hands on, he educates himself.\"\n\nFortunately for Djokovic, the surgery worked wonders and he was back to his best after just a few weeks. He ended up winning four out of the next six Grand Slams and has won eight more since.\n\nThe 37-year-old will be hoping for a similar reaction to his latest injury setback, but with his 40s fast approaching that might be easier said than done.\n\nWith Djokovic out of the running at Rolland Garros, it gives Casper Ruud a walkover into the semi-finals. There, he'll face the winner of Alexander Zverev and Alex de Minaur. Meanwhile, tournament favourite Carlos Alcaraz faces Jannik Sinner in the other semi-final.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It was the fifth homer in five games for the reigning World Series MVP.\n\nJosh Hader replaced Valdez and walked Marcus Semien before Josh Jung flied out to the base of the wall in right field. It was Hader's 23rd consecutive save, one shy of Brad Lidge's franchise record from 2005.\n\n\"I try to always go out there trying to have fun,\" Valdez said through an interpreter. \"Obviously, sometimes I have got to get serious. Went out there and do what I try to do every single time, try and throw strikes on all my pitches and just try to help help the team win.\"\n\nYordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that ended up being the difference. Jake Meyers drove in the first two Houston runs with a pair of singles.\n\nValdez, whose other no-hitter was a 2-0 victory against Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023, had a perfect game through five innings, but still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six.\n\nThe perfect game ended when Jonah Heim opened the sixth by reaching on Bregman's throwing error. Grossman then grounded into a double play before Duran was called out on strikes.\n\nBregman's error came when he fielded a high chopper on the run and threw low to first baseman Jon Singleton, who couldn't make the scoop about a half step ahead of Heim.\n\nSemien walked with two outs in the seventh to finally get a fourth batter to the plate in the same inning for Texas, but Jung struck out on three pitches.\n\nValdez cruised through the eighth with routine flyouts from Wyatt Langford, Adolis Garc\u00eda and Heim.\n\nHe topped out at 96.9 mph on his fastball, but created plenty of soft contact with plenty of off-speed pitches.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is try to go out and try to get outs, try to trick the hitter a little bit,\" Valdez said.\n\nIt was just the third win in nine games for the Astros, who had cooled off since an extended hot streak that helped them overtake Seattle in the AL West. Houston started the day 1 1/2 games behind the Mariners, with Texas five back.\n\nHouston's other no-hitter came from Ronel Blanco on April 1, a rare victory during a 7-19 start before the Astros steadied themselves, and surged in the standings, before another downtown.\n\n\"I told him that's a hell of a performance, in Spanish,\" manager Joe Espada said of Valdez. \"I used up a few other words in Spanish, but, you know, said we needed that. And we need guys like that to step up and give us innings. And he did.\"\n\nSeager had one of the other hardest-hit outs, flying out to left fielder Alvarez on the warning track for the second out of the fourth inning. The homer went 411 feet into the seats right field.\n\n\"You're aware of it all game that you haven't got a hit yet,\" Seager said. \"Everybody's going up there to try to do it. Just fortunate enough it happened.\"\n\nValdez entered the game 5-0 in his previous seven starts, all Houston victories. He was scratched from his other scheduled start against Texas this season after losing to the Rangers twice in the AL Championship Series last fall.\n\nTyler Mahle made his first start for Texas, and first since April 2023 coming off Tommy John surgery. The right-hander allowed five hits and a run in five innings with two strikeouts. Mahle (0-1) signed a $22 million, two-year contract in December with the Rangers knowing he would rehab most of the season.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV

It was the fifth homer in five games for the reigning World Series MVP.\n\nJosh Hader replaced Valdez and walked Marcus Semien before Josh Jung flied out to the base of the wall in right field. It was Hader's 23rd consecutive save, one shy of Brad Lidge's franchise record from 2005.\n\n\"I try to always go out there trying to have fun,\" Valdez said through an interpreter. \"Obviously, sometimes I have got to get serious. Went out there and do what I try to do every single time, try and throw strikes on all my pitches and just try to help help the team win.\"\n\nYordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that ended up being the difference. Jake Meyers drove in the first two Houston runs with a pair of singles.\n\nValdez, whose other no-hitter was a 2-0 victory against Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023, had a perfect game through five innings, but still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six.\n\nThe perfect game ended when Jonah Heim opened the sixth by reaching on Bregman's throwing error. Grossman then grounded into a double play before Duran was called out on strikes.\n\nBregman's error came when he fielded a high chopper on the run and threw low to first baseman Jon Singleton, who couldn't make the scoop about a half step ahead of Heim.\n\nSemien walked with two outs in the seventh to finally get a fourth batter to the plate in the same inning for Texas, but Jung struck out on three pitches.\n\nValdez cruised through the eighth with routine flyouts from Wyatt Langford, Adolis Garc\u00eda and Heim.\n\nHe topped out at 96.9 mph on his fastball, but created plenty of soft contact with plenty of off-speed pitches.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is try to go out and try to get outs, try to trick the hitter a little bit,\" said Valdez, who struck out five and walked three in 8 2/3 innings.\n\nIt was just the third win in nine games for the Astros, who had cooled off since an extended hot streak that helped them overtake Seattle in the AL West. Houston started the day 1 1/2 games behind the Mariners, with Texas five back.\n\nHouston's other no-hitter came from Ronel Blanco on April 1, a rare victory during a 7-19 start before the Astros steadied themselves, and surged in the standings, before another downtown.\n\n\"I told him that's a hell of a performance, in Spanish,\" manager Joe Espada said of Valdez. \"I used up a few other words in Spanish, but, you know, said we needed that. And we need guys like that to step up and give us innings. And he did.\"\n\nSeager had one of the other hardest-hit outs, flying out to left fielder Alvarez on the warning track for the second out of the fourth inning. The homer went 411 feet into the seats right field.\n\n\"You're aware of it all game that you haven't got a hit yet,\" Seager said. \"Everybody's going up there to try to do it. Just fortunate enough it happened.\"\n\nValdez entered the game 5-0 in his previous seven starts, all Houston victories. He was scratched from his other scheduled start against Texas this season after losing to the Rangers twice in the AL Championship Series last fall.\n\nTyler Mahle made his first start for Texas, and first since April 2023 coming off Tommy John surgery. The right-hander allowed five hits and a run in five innings with two strikeouts. Mahle (0-1) signed a $22 million, two-year contract in December with the Rangers knowing he would rehab most of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Yusei Kikuchi (4-9, 4.67 ERA) is scheduled for the Astros in the series finale after tying a franchise record with eight consecutive strikeouts in his Houston debut, a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay, following a trade with Toronto.

It was Seager's fifth homer in five games.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander cruised through eight innings but finally began to stumble in the ninth, walking Robbie Grossman before Ezequiel Duran grounded into the second Texas double play of the game.\n\nJosh Smith kept the Rangers alive with another walk, setting up Seager's 24th homer.\n\nValdez was immediately replaced by closer Josh Hader, who walked Marcus Semien before Josh Jung flied out to the base of the wall in right field to end the game.\n\nYordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that ended up being the difference. Jake Meyers' drove in the first two Houston runs with a pair of RBI singles.\n\nValdez had a perfect game through five innings, but still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six.\n\nThe perfect game ended when Jonah Heim opened the sixth by reaching on third baseman Alex Bregman's throwing error. Robbie Grossman then grounded into a double play before Ezequiel Duran was called out on strikes.\n\nBregman's error came when he fielded a high chopper on the run and threw low to first baseman Jon Singleton, who couldn't make the scoop to keep the perfect game intact.\n\nSemien walked with two outs in the seventh to finally get a fourth batter to the plate in an inning for Texas, but Jung struck out on three pitches. It was Valdez's fifth strikeout.\n\nValdez cruised through the eighth with routine flyouts from Wyatt Langford, Adolis Garc\u00eda and Heim.\n\nValdez's other no-hitter was a 2-0 victory over Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023.\n\nThe two-time All-Star topped out at 96.9 mph on his fastball, but created plenty of soft contact with plenty of off-speed pitches.\n\nSeager had one of the other hardest-hit outs, flying out to left fielder Alvarez on the warning track for the second out of the fourth inning.\n\nValdez entered the game 5-0 in his previous seven starts, all Houston victories. He was scratched from his other scheduled start against Texas this season after losing to the World Series champions twice in the AL Championship Series last fall.\n\nTyler Mahle made his first start for Texas, and first since April 2023 coming off Tommy John surgery. The right-hander allowed five hits and a run in five innings. He signed a $22 million, two-year contract in December with the Rangers knowing he would rehab most of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Yusei Kikuchi (4-9, 4.67 ERA) is scheduled for the Astros in the series finale after tying a franchise record with eight consecutive strikeouts in his Houston debut, a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay, following a trade with Toronto. Texas RHP Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a (3-6, 3.70) is set for his 27th appearance and eighth start.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It was Seager's fifth homer in five games.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander cruised through eight innings but finally began to stumble in the ninth against his Texas rival and the defending World Series champions.\n\nRobbie Grossman drew a leadoff walk on Valdez's 99th pitch, but the 100th was the second Texas double play of the game on Ezequiel Duran's bouncer to Alex Bregman at third.\n\nJosh Smith kept the Rangers alive with another walk, setting up Seager's 24th homer on the 107th pitch from Valdez.\n\nThe two-time All-Star was immediately replaced by closer Josh Hader, who walked Marcus Semien before Josh Jung flied out to the base of the wall in right field. It was Hader's 23rd consecutive save, one shy of Brad Lidge's franchise record from 2005.\n\n\"I try to always go out there trying to have fun,\" Valdez said through an interpreter. \"Obviously, sometimes I have got to get serious. Went out there and do what I try to do every single time, try and throw strikes on all my pitches and just try to help help the team win.\"\n\nYordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that ended up being the difference. Jake Meyers drove in the first two Houston runs with a pair of RBI singles.\n\nValdez, whose other no-hitter was a 2-0 victory against Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023, had a perfect game through five innings, but still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six.\n\nThe perfect game ended when Jonah Heim opened the sixth by reaching on third baseman Bregman's throwing error. Grossman then grounded into a double play before Duran was called out on strikes.\n\nBregman's error came when he fielded a high chopper on the run and threw low to first baseman Jon Singleton, who couldn't make the scoop about a half step ahead of Heim.\n\nSemien walked with two outs in the seventh to finally get a fourth batter to the plate in an inning for Texas, but Jung struck out on three pitches.\n\nValdez cruised through the eighth with routine flyouts from Wyatt Langford, Adolis Garc\u00eda and Heim.\n\nHe topped out at 96.9 mph on his fastball, but created plenty of soft contact with plenty of off-speed pitches.\n\nSeager had one of the other hardest-hit outs, flying out to left fielder Alvarez on the warning track for the second out of the fourth inning.\n\nValdez entered the game 5-0 in his previous seven starts, all Houston victories. He was scratched from his other scheduled start against Texas this season after losing to the Rangers twice in the AL Championship Series last fall.\n\nTyler Mahle made his first start for Texas, and first since April 2023 coming off Tommy John surgery. The right-hander allowed five hits and a run in five innings. He signed a $22 million, two-year contract in December with the Rangers knowing he would rehab most of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Yusei Kikuchi (4-9, 4.67 ERA) is scheduled for the Astros in the series finale after tying a franchise record with eight consecutive strikeouts in his Houston debut, a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay, following a trade with Toronto. Texas RHP Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a (3-6, 3.70) is set for his 27th appearance and eighth start.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors":

It was Seager's fifth homer in five games.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander cruised through eight innings but finally began to stumble in the ninth, walking Robbie Grossman before Ezequiel Duran grounded into the second Texas double play of the game.\n\nJosh Smith kept the Rangers alive with another walk, setting up Seager's 24th homer.\n\nValdez was immediately replaced by closer Josh Hader, who walked Marcus Semien before Josh Jung flied out to the base of the wall in right field to end the game.\n\nYordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that ended up being the difference. Jake Meyers' drove in the first two Houston runs with a pair of RBI singles.\n\nValdez had a perfect game through five innings, but still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six.\n\nThe perfect game ended when Jonah Heim opened the sixth by reaching on third baseman Alex Bregman's throwing error. Robbie Grossman then grounded into a double play before Ezequiel Duran was called out on strikes.\n\nBregman's error came when he fielded a high chopper on the run and threw low to first baseman Jon Singleton, who couldn't make the scoop to keep the perfect game intact.\n\nSemien walked with two outs in the seventh to finally get a fourth batter to the plate in an inning for Texas, but Jung struck out on three pitches. It was Valdez's fifth strikeout.\n\nThe two-time All-Star topped out at 96.9 mph on his fastball, but created plenty of soft contact with plenty of off-speed pitches.\n\nSeager had one of the other hardest-hit outs, flying out to left fielder Alvarez on the warning track for the second out of the fourth inning.\n\nValdez entered the game 5-0 in his previous seven starts, all Houston victories. He was scratched from his other scheduled start against Texas this season after losing to the World Series champions twice in the AL Championship Series last fall.\n\nTyler Mahle made his first start for Texas, and first since April 2023 coming off Tommy John surgery. The right-hander allowed five hits and a run in five innings. He signed a $22 million, two-year contract in December with the Rangers knowing he would rehab most of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Yusei Kikuchi (4-9, 4.67 ERA) is scheduled for the Astros in the series finale after tying a franchise record with eight consecutive strikeouts in his Houston debut, a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay, following a trade with Toronto.

Teammate Ronel Blanco's no-hitter in April was the first.\n\nSan Diego Padres right-hander Dylan Cease and San Francisco Giants left-hander Blake Snell also threw complete game no-hitters this season.\n\nAstros closer Josh Hader relieved Valdez after Seager's home run, and recorded the final out of Houston's victory two batters later.\n\nValdez was bidding for his second career no-hitter. He no-hit the Cleveland Guardians in Aug. 2023, needing only 93 pitches to complete the task.\n\nFor most of the game Tuesday, he was looking up to the task again. Valdez did not walk a batter until the seventh inning; the only Ranger to reach base before that did so on an error. Valdez had thrown only 60 pitches through the first six innings, and 75 through the first seven.\n\nAfter a 1-2-3 eighth inning, it was obvious Valdez had the stamina to pitch the ninth. The only question was whether the Rangers had a hit in their bats down 4-0.\n\nRobbie Grossman's leadoff walk was quickly erased when Ezequiel Duran grounded into a double play, leaving Valdez one out away from the no-hitter.\n\nBut Smith drew a six-pitch walk of his own, laying off a changeup in the dirt with two strikes to earn the free base.\n\nThat brought up Seager, one of the game's best sluggers -- and its most aggressive. True to form, he clobbered a hanging slider from Valdez on the first pitch he saw for his 24th home run of the season.\n\nThe Rangers trailed, 4-2.\n\nValdez looked around, frustrated, cognizant of the significance of the moment. His night was over.\n\nHader walked the next batter, Marcus Semien, but got Josh Jung to fly out to end the game. Valdez had to settle for 8.2 innings of one-hit ball and his 11th win of the season.\n\nValdez last year became the first left-handed pitcher in Astros history to throw a complete game no-hitter.

Closer Josh Hader came on for his 23rd consecutive save as soon as Valdez lost his no-hit bid.\n\nIt was just the third win in nine games for Houston, and came a night after the Astros gave up Josh Smith's game-ending, two-run homer in a 4-3 victory in 10 innings for their Texas rival and the defending World Series champion.\n\n\"The team needed that win,\" Houston manager Joe Espada said. \"Framber to go deep, kind of give our bullpen a little break there. Even though we had to use Josh, it was a really great team win.\"\n\nValdez is 6-0 over his past eight starts, and he has two of the three wins over the 3-6 stretch, which followed a 30-game surge (21-9 record) that briefly pushed Houston past Seattle atop the AL West.\n\nWith the Astros' victory and Seattle's loss to Detroit later Tuesday, Houston is a half-game back. The Rangers are five behind in a division that isn't likely to include an AL wild card.\n\nValdez (11-5) had to settle for getting 26 outs on a night he took a perfect game into the sixth inning and had still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six when a double play wiped out third baseman Alex Bregman's throwing error.\n\nAnother double play after a walk in the ninth put the 30-year-old on the brink of Houston's second no-hitter this season ( Ronel Blanco threw one April 1 ). Seager's fifth homer in five games spoiled it.\n\n\"He was good all night,\" Seager said. \"He just didn't throw anything in the middle of the plate. Tip your cap to a guy who can go out and locate every pitch that well all game.\"\n\nValdez's first no-hitter was a 2-0 victory over Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023. Four starts later, the two-time All-Star threw seven no-hit innings in a 4-1 loss to Detroit.\n\nOver the past eight starts this season, Valdez has allowed two or fewer runs five times. And in his most recent loss, he gave up just two hits in six innings in a 2-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox.\n\n\"You've got your hands full when he's on top of his game,\" Texas manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done that to a lot of teams.\"\n\nA shaky second half in 2023 left questions about whether Valdez was still the staff ace, even though his streak of consecutive opening day starts reached three this year when Justin Verlander was injured.\n\nVerlander was with the New York Mets to start 2023 but returned to the Astros before the trade deadline a year ago.\n\nWhile Verlander is close to returning from a neck injury, Valdez is showing top-of-the-rotation form. His latest outing came against the team that beat him twice in the AL Championship Series last year.\n\nNow Valdez just has to push aside the disappointment of such a close call as the Astros focus on yet another pennant race after seven consecutive trips to the ALCS.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" he said through an interpreter. \"Not everybody gets a no-hitter all the way to the ninth inning. The most important thing is the team won, I won.

two out in ninth", "body": "Houston's Framber Valdez needed just one more out to pitch his second Major League Baseball no-hitter on Tuesday before Corey Seager smashed a home run for Texas, though the game still ended in the Astros' 4-2 triumph.\n\nValdez, a 30-year-old left-hander from the Dominican Republic, struck out five Rangers batters and issued three walks before giving up the homer and departing to a standing ovation.\n\nThe pitcher, who threw 67 of his season-high 107 pitches for strikes, baffled the Rangers for eight innings, then opening the ninth by walking Robbie Grossman before Ezequiel Duran grounded into a double play.\n\nOne out from completing the no-hitter, Valdez walked Josh Smith to bring Seager to the plate, where the short stop smashed the ball into the right-field stands, lifting the Rangers to two runs in the final round.\n\nAstros reliever Josh Hader took the mound, walked Marcus Semien, then induced Josh Jung to hit a fly ball out to right field to end the game, Valdez getting the victory to improve to 11-5 on the season.\n\nValdez threw his first no-hitter for the Astros on August 1, 2023, against visiting Cleveland, the 16th no-hitter for Houston but the first by a left-hander.\n\nHe would have joined Don Wilson, who threw two no-hitters in the 1960s, as the only Astros pitchers with multiple no-hitters.\n\njs/jgc", "source": {"uri":

With one man on and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Seager launched a hanging Valdez slider into the right-field stands. The blast cut Houston's 4-0 lead over the Texas Rangers in half.\n\nJust like that, Valdez's shot at a second entry into the record books was done. Closer Josh Hader took over on the mound. He issued a leadoff walk, then got the final out on a deep fly ball from Josh Jung that came up just short of tying the game. Houston held on for the 4-2 win.\n\nValdez left the eighth inning having thrown 93 pitches but was allowed by Astros manager Joe Espada to go for the milestone. Hader warmed up between innings, but Valdez took the mound in an effort to finish the game. He walked leadoff hitter Robbie Grossman and then induced a double-play on his first pitch to Ezequiel Dur\u00e1n.\n\nHe then walked Josh Smith, setting up Seager to spoil the no-hitter in the next at-bat. Valdez finished the game allowing one hit and two earned runs with three walks and five strikeouts in 8 2/3 innings.\n\nWhile there was no no-hitter, the victory came at an opportune time for the Astros, who are embroiled in a race with the Seattle Mariners for the AL West crown. The win moved the Astros (58-55) one game behind the Mariners at the top of the division standings. It also pushed the Rangers (54-60) to 5.5 games back of Seattle in their long-shot hopes of joining the race.\n\nA two-time All-Star, Valdez is in the midst of another strong season in Houston. He entered Tuesday's game with a 3.56 ERA and 1.246 WHIP with 108 strikeouts and 38 walks in 116 1/3 innings pitched. His no-hitter took place almost a year ago to the day, in a win over the Cleveland Guardians on Aug. 1, 2023.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_owens@aol.com", "name": "Jason Owens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framber_Valdez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Framber Valdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Seager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corey Seager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hader", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jung", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Grossman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Grossman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezequiel_Dur\u00e1n", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezequiel Dur\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZU2ghDkjuIics0M7jdG1.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/058a7c03474b9874007341b332d731cb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796673", "eventUri": "eng-9796673", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

It was Seager's fifth homer in five games.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander cruised through eight innings but finally began to stumble in the ninth against his Texas rival and the defending World Series champions.\n\nRobbie Grossman drew a leadoff walk on Valdez's 99th pitch, but the 100th was the second Texas double play of the game on Ezequiel Duran's bouncer to Alex Bregman at third.\n\nJosh Smith kept the Rangers alive with another walk, setting up Seager's 24th homer on the 107th pitch from Valdez.\n\nThe two-time All-Star was immediately replaced by closer Josh Hader, who walked Marcus Semien before Josh Jung flied out to the base of the wall in right field. It was Hader's 23rd consecutive save, one shy of Brad Lidge's franchise record from 2005.\n\nHouston Astros pitcher Framber Valdez pitches in the first inning of a baseball game against the Houston Astros, Tuesday, Aug 6, 2024, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Albert Pena)\n\n\"I try to always go out there trying to have fun,\" Valdez said through an interpreter. \"Obviously, sometimes I have got to get serious. Went out there and do what I try to do every single time, try and throw strikes on all my pitches and just try to help help the team win.\"\n\nYordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that ended up being the difference. Jake Meyers drove in the first two Houston runs with a pair of RBI singles.\n\nValdez, whose other no-hitter was a 2-0 victory against Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023, had a perfect game through five innings, but still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six.\n\nThe perfect game ended when Jonah Heim opened the sixth by reaching on third baseman Bregman\u00b4s throwing error. Grossman then grounded into a double play before Duran was called out on strikes.\n\nBregman\u00b4s error came when he fielded a high chopper on the run and threw low to first baseman Jon Singleton, who couldn\u00b4t make the scoop about a half step ahead of Heim.\n\nSemien walked with two outs in the seventh to finally get a fourth batter to the plate in an inning for Texas, but Jung struck out on three pitches.\n\nValdez cruised through the eighth with routine flyouts from Wyatt Langford, Adolis Garc\u00eda and Heim.\n\nHe topped out at 96.9 mph on his fastball, but created plenty of soft contact with plenty of off-speed pitches.\n\nSeager had one of the other hardest-hit outs, flying out to left fielder Alvarez on the warning track for the second out of the fourth inning.\n\nValdez entered the game 5-0 in his previous seven starts, all Houston victories. He was scratched from his other scheduled start against Texas this season after losing to the Rangers twice in the AL Championship Series last fall.\n\nTyler Mahle made his first start for Texas, and first since April 2023 coming off Tommy John surgery. The right-hander allowed five hits and a run in five innings. He signed a $22 million, two-year contract in December with the Rangers knowing he would rehab most of the season.\n\nLHP Yusei Kikuchi (4-9, 4.67 ERA) is scheduled for the Astros in the series finale after tying a franchise record with eight consecutive strikeouts in his Houston debut, a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay, following a trade with Toronto. Texas RHP Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a (3-6, 3.70) is set for his 27th appearance and eighth start.\n\nAP MLB: https://www.apnews.com/hub/MLB\n\nHouston Astros Jeremy Pena celebrates in the dugout after scoring a run in the third inning on a base hit by Jake Myers during a baseball game against the Texas Rangers, Tuesday, Aug 6, 2024, in Arlington, Texas.

Even though we had to use Josh, it was a really great team win.\"\n\nValdez is 6-0 over his past eight starts, and he has two of the three wins over the 3-6 stretch, which followed a 30-game surge (21-9 record) that briefly pushed Houston past Seattle atop the AL West.\n\nWith the Astros' victory and Seattle's loss to Detroit later Tuesday, Houston is a half-game back. The Rangers are five behind in a division that isn't likely to include an AL wild card.\n\nValdez (11-5) had to settle for getting 26 outs on a night he took a perfect game into the sixth inning and had still faced the minimum of 18 batters through six when a double play wiped out third baseman Alex Bregman's throwing error.\n\nAnother double play after a walk in the ninth put the 30-year-old on the brink of Houston's second no-hitter this season ( Ronel Blanco threw one April 1 ). Seager's fifth homer in five games spoiled it.\n\n\"He was good all night,\" Seager said. \"He just didn't throw anything in the middle of the plate. Tip your cap to a guy who can go out and locate every pitch that well all game.\"\n\nValdez's first no-hitter was a 2-0 victory over Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023. Four starts later, the two-time All-Star threw seven no-hit innings in a 4-1 loss to Detroit.\n\nOver the past eight starts this season, Valdez has allowed two or fewer runs five times. And in his most recent loss, he gave up just two hits in six innings in a 2-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox.\n\n\"You've got your hands full when he's on top of his game,\" Texas manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done that to a lot of teams.\"\n\nA shaky second half in 2023 left questions about whether Valdez was still the staff ace, even though his streak of consecutive opening day starts reached three this year when Justin Verlander was injured.\n\nVerlander was with the New York Mets to start 2023 but returned to the Astros before the trade deadline a year ago.\n\nWhile Verlander is close to returning from a neck injury, Valdez is showing top-of-the-rotation form. His latest outing came against the team that beat him twice in the AL Championship Series last year.\n\nNow Valdez just has to push aside the disappointment of such a close call as the Astros focus on yet another pennant race after seven consecutive trips to the ALCS.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" he said through an interpreter. \"Not everybody gets a no-hitter all the way to the ninth inning. The most important thing is the team won, I won. And I battled.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framber_Valdez",

Seager's two-run homer ended the no-hit attempt and Valdez's night but the Astros held on for a 4-2 series-evening win.\n\nValdez walked two batters in the ninth before Seager's homer, including Robbie Grossman to leadoff the inning. But Grossman was erases on Ezequiel Duran's 5-4-3 double-play. Valdez walked Josh Smith ahead of Seager.\n\nAfter Josh Hader replaced Valdez, he walked Marcus Semien ahead of Josh Jung, who nearly tied the game with a drive to right-field but it was caught at the wall to end the game.\n\nAll total, Valdez allowed five baserunners, including a sixth-inning throwing error on third baseman Alex Bregman. Valdez retired the first 15 batters in order until the Jonah Heim reached on a slow tapper to Bregman, who threw wide to first base to start the sixth. Valdez quickly erased Heim with a double-play. He walked Marcus Semien with two outs in the seven but struck out Josh Jung to end that inning.\n\n\"Four pitches all working for him,\" Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's got great stuff. Hard sinker at 96 [mph]. He got a lot of ground balls, a lot of early outs, especially early in the game.\"\n\nThe Rangers had an excellent performance from their starter as well, as Tyler Mahle allowed a run on five hits over five innings in his first start since having Tommy John surgery in May 2023.\n\nBut Mahle and the Rangers were no match for Valdez, who threw his first no-hitter nearly exactly a year ago on Aug. 1, 2023. That was at Minute Maid Park in Houston. He walked one and struck out seven in that no-hitter against the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nThe Astros evened the series withe Rangers with the win. The clubs are 6-6 in 2024. The winner of Wednesday's series finale will own the series edge if tiebreakers are necessary at the end of the regular season. The Astros moved back to 4.5 games ahead of the Rangers in the AL West, one game behind the first-place Seattle Mariners, who were still playing the Tigers in a scoreless game Tuesday night.\n\nTyler Mahle held the Astros to a run on five hits and a walk with two strikeouts over five innings. It's the right-hander's first appearance for the Rangers since signing a two-year deal in the offseason. Mahle had Tommy John surgery in May 2023 and has been recovering throughout the summer. He threw 76 pitches Tuesday night as he continues to build up strength and stamina.\n\nMahle didn't receive the best defense behind him. With one out in the fourth, Mahle walked Jeremy Pena but a 5-4-3 double play was thwarted when Marcus Semien struggled to transfer the ball from his glove for the throw to first. A soft blooper then dropped in front of Adolis Garcia, allowing the first run to score.\n\nCorey Seager hit his fifth home in the past five games with a two-run shot in the ninth. Seager has homered in a season high-tying three consecutive games and four of his past five games. Seager is batting .350 with five homers, seven RBI during the first five games of the current homestand. He has a team-high 24 homers, the fourth-most in his career.\n\nSpot start right-hander Jose Urena will take the hill in the series finale against Astros left-hander Yusei Kikuchi (4-9, 4.67) at 1:35

He issued a leadoff walk, then got the final out of the game on a deep fly ball from Josh Jung that came up just short of tying the game.\n\nValdez left the eighth inning having thrown 93 pitches and was allowed by Astros manager Joe Espada to go for the milestone. Hader warmed up between innings, but Valdez took the mound in an effort to finish the game. He walked leadoff hitter Robbie Grossman, but induced a double-play on his first pitch to Ezequiel Dur\u00e1n.\n\nHe then walked leadoff hitter Josh Smith, setting up Seager to spoil the no-hitter on the next at-bat.\n\nWhile there was no no-hitter, the win came at an opportune time for the Astros, who are embroiled in a race with the Seattle Mariners for the AL West crown. The win moved the Astros (58-55) one game behind the Mariners at the top of the division standings. It also pushed the Rangers (54-60) six games back of the Astros in their long-shot hopes of joining the race.\n\nA two-time All-Star, Valdez is in the midst of another strong season in Houston.

That marked the 17th no-no in franchise history, but the first from a lefty.\n\nThe Astros already got a no-hitter out of Ronel Blanco on April 1 earlier this season.

He would issue three walks the rest of the way with his third being the fateful free pass. He actually walked the leadoff man in the ninth -- his second of the game -- but erased it with a double play. He was then one out away from the no-hitter and missed with a 3-2 pitch to leadoff man Josh Smith. That brought Seager to the plate to see Valdez for the fourth time, always a risky move for a pitcher facing a hitter the caliber of Seager that many times.\n\nSeager made him pay with the home run, driving Valdez out of the game. This was actually the second time in Seager's career he's broken up a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth; he also did so against Matt Moore in 2016.\n\nThe Astros are the second team this season to get one out away from a no-hitter before coughing up a homer. The Braves did so on May 11 when the Mets' J.D. Martinez homered.\n\nAstros closer Josh Hader got the final out, though it wasn't easy. He walked Semien and then Josh Jung sent a deep fly to right field that came a few feet from tying the game. Instead it was a warning-track fly out and the Astros prevailed, 4-2. Yordan Alvarez's two-run shot provided necessary insurance for the Astros, as it turned out, in the top of the ninth.\n\nValdez struck out five and held the Rangers to just three hard-hit balls before the ninth inning.\n\nValdez would have entered even more exclusive company than simply throwing a no-hitter. He's already done that, on Aug. 1 last season against the Guardians. He would have joined a group of just 35 others with multiple no-hitters. This would have been the 18th no-hitter in Astros franchise history and the second this season, after Ronel Blanco pulled it off on April 1.\n\nThe Astros have seen a surge in no-hitters in the last decade. Heading into the 2015 season, there had been 10 in club history with the most recent no-hitter being a combined job -- started by Roy Oswalt -- in 2003. Valdez's would have been the eighth since the start of the 2015 season, a stretch that includes the combined no-hitter in Game 4 of the 2022 World Series.\n\nThis would have been the fourth no-hitter of the 2024 season, and the third in 13 days. Blanco's was followed by the Padres' Dylan Cease on July 25 against the Reds and the Giants' Blake Snell against the Reds last Friday.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_snyder@cbssports.com", "name": "Matt Snyder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framber_Valdez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Framber Valdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_game_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perfect game (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Seager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corey Seager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The next: He's helping the Texas Rangers avoid being no-hit. Alas, at this point a loss is a loss and all Seager did Tuesday was end Framber Valdez's night and prolong the Rangers' agony in a 4-2 loss. Seattle joined the Rangers in the loss column on Tuesday, and Texas remains five games behind the Mariners in the AL West standings.\n\nAdvertisementRangers\n\nBe the smartest Rangers fan.

After Monday's walk-off hero, Josh Smith, had drawn a two-out walk to push Valdez's pitch count to 106, Seager jumped all over a first-pitch slider for a two-run homer to bring the crowd of 34,458 to life.\n\nIt also led to Valdez's exit. Reliever Josh Hader walked Marcus Semien and then allowed a long fly ball to Josh Jung that Chas McCormick reeled in at the base of the wall in right field. If you are looking for consolation, well, maybe Seager's fifth homer in five games on the home stand was payback for Marwin Gonzalez breaking up Yu Darvish's bid for perfection back in 2013. So, they are even there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the standings, not so much. And time keeps on slipping away (hey, the Steve Miller Band is in town with Def Leppard, too) from the Rangers. They had hoped that Smith's homer on Monday, their first walkoff homer of the season, would get the offense moving. They have waited all year for the offense to move. From time to time, it lurches forward for a day or two, then stalls like a mule.\n\nCan't lump Seager in that mix, though. He's been on one of late. On the homestand, he's seven for 19 with five homers and seven RBIs. Where things matter, though, the Rangers are just 2-3 with one game remaining on Wednesday. They have lost ground over the week in a race in which they can't afford any more slippage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValdez, who threw a no-hitter against Cleveland last Aug. 1, was sharp from the start, mixing in his elite curveball a little more than usual. He typically throws the curveball about 30% of the time, but flirted with 40% entering the ninth inning. He also upped his slider usage a bit, combining to throw the two pitches for 53 of his 107 pitches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It goes the way of the guy on the mound, he sets a tone,\" Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's sets a tone. They had their guy going and he just shut us down. He had all four pitches working for him. He got a lot of early outs on ground balls. That's what he does.\"\n\nThe Rangers, who had lost six of their last nine games started by opposing left-handers, continued to shuffle the lineup and it led to two hitters with some degree of success against Valdez sitting on the bench. Leody Taveras, 8-for-23 in his career against Valdez, sat because of his poor splits against lefties this season. Taveras had just a .582 OPS against lefties. Also, Nathaniel Lowe, in a 1-for-15 skid on the homestand, also sat. Lowe was 6 for 23 with four walks in his career against Valdez.\n\nValdez retired the Rangers in order the first time through the lineup, allowing just one ball out of the infield. He retired the next six hitters over the fourth and fifth before Jonah Heim led off the sixth with a chopper of a ground ball to third, which Alex Bregman fielded on the run and then threw low to first base for an error. Perfect game bid was over. But then he got Robbie Grossman to bounce into a double play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValdez walked Marcus Semien with two outs in the seventh, then struck out Jung. He got three fly ball outs from Wyatt Langford, Adolis Garc\u00eda and Heim to roll through the eighth, putting him in position to post the third no-hitter against the Rangers in the five seasons since Globe Life Field opened. San Diego's Joe Musgrove no-hit them in April of 2021 and New York's Corey Kluber followed with another five weeks later.\n\nThat set the stage for the ninth. Grossman worked a six-pitch walk to push Valdez to 100 pitches, but, on the very next pitch, Ezequiel Duran swung over a changeup down and in for another double play grounder. Smith saw all of Valdez's repertoire in the first four pitches of the at-bat, refusing to swing and working ahead to a 3-1 count. He swung early on a changeup to run the count full, before laying off another change in the dirt.\n\nIt brought Seager back to the plate. By that point, he'd seen 12 pitches, including all four varieties that Valdez throws, in his first three at-bats. He'd swung at a 3-0 sinker and fouled it off in the seventh before popping out on a curveball in. When Valdez left a slider up and in the zone, he did not miss, saving the Rangers at least the embarrassment of getting no-hit at home by their arch-rivals.\n\nIn the end, though, a loss is a loss. At this point, that's all that matters.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreWatch: Rangers' Corey Seager breaks up Framber Valdez's no-hitter with two outs in 9thESPN ranks Texas Rangers' farm

Texas Rangers shortstop Corey Seager hit a home run in the ninth inning to break up the no-no and bring the deficit to just two runs. The Astros hung on to win 4-2. Valdez has thrown one no-hitter in his career back in 2023.\n\nThe Rangers had just two base runners through the first eight innings but were able to get to Valdez in the ninth. He issued two walks, just his second and third of the game before Seager got up. Ezequiel Duran grounded into a double play, bringing the final out to the plate. Josh Smith was walked and Corey Seager hit the home run to end the no-hit bid.\n\nNo-hitters have been a common occurrence in recent weeks. Dylan Cease threw a no-no for the San Diego Padres against the Washington Nationals on July 25. San Francisco's Blake Snell followed by shutting down the Cincinnati Reds on August 2. Ronel Blanco started the season by throwing one for the Astros on April 1. There were none between Blanco's and Cease's.\n\nValdez had taken a step back this year from his prior excellence before Tuesday's. His 3.56 ERA is his highest since 2020 and his 113 ERA+ is his lowest since 2021. While the close call will help those numbers, the Astros still need him to improve to keep their ALCS streak alive.\n\nThe Astros and Rangers are both in the thick of the American League West and Wild Card races. The win extends the gap between the teams to four-and-a-half games in favor of the Astros. The Rangers would be the first defending champions to miss the playoffs since their manager Bruce Bochy and the 2011 Giants missed after their first championship.\n\nThe Astros and Rangers will meet in a rubber match on Wednesday afternoon in Arlington.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He's already done that, on Aug. 1 last season against the Guardians. He would join a group of just 35 others with multiple no-hitters. This would also be the 18th no-hitter in Astros franchise history and the second this season, after Ronel Blanco pulled it off on April 1.\n\nThe Astros have seen a surge in no-hitters in the last decade. Heading into the 2015 season, there had been 10 in club history with the most recent no-hitter being a combined job -- started by Roy Oswalt -- in 2003. Should Valdez complete this, it would be the eighth since the start of the 2015 season, a stretch that includes the combined no-hitter in Game 4 of the 2022 World Series.\n\nThis would be the fourth no-hitter of the 2024 season, and the third in 13 days.

Four months later, they nearly had another.\n\nFramber Valdez came as close as a pitcher possibly can to throwing a no-hitter on Tuesday night against the Texas Rangers, only to have his shot at history literally obliterated at the last possible second.\n\nThe two-time All-Star was in complete control from the start, retiring the first 15 batters he faced. Jonah Heim ruined the perfect game by reaching on an Alex Bregman throwing error to lead off the bottom of the sixth, but he was promptly erased on a double play.\n\nValdez issued his first walk of the game in the seventh, but did not allow a hit in either the seventh or eighth. That set the stage for a dramatic bottom of the ninth at Globe Life Field with a chance at history on the line.\n\nThe 30-year-old lefty didn't start the inning well, walking Robbie Grossman on a 3-2 pitch to lead off the frame. After getting Ezequiel Duran to ground into a double play, however, Valdez needed just one more out to complete the no-no.\n\nHe never got it. Valdez was one strike away with a full count on Josh Smith, but walked him. That brought up Corey Seager, who immediately launched the first pitch more than 400 feet into the bleachers to end Valdez's quest for history.\n\nThat was all from the veteran southpaw, his day done after 107 pitches. He walked off the field in disbelief as Joe Espada took the ball from him and handed it to Josh Hader, who got the final out to nail down the 4-2 victory.\n\nOn the bright side for Valdez, at least he's already thrown a no-hitter, which he achieved on Aug. 1 last year against the Cleveland Guardians. Still, to come that close to history, only to fall just short, has to sting.\n\nValdez improves to 11-5 with a 3.46 ERA with the win, but that's little consolation after coming within one strike of a no-no.

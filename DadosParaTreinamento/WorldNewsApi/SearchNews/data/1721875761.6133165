Now they may be coming back, traders said, which would help set a floor for the Forties price. \"There's more confidence that this time the problem has been solved. Some people may step back into the market and buy Forties as a baseload grade,\" said a North Sea oil trader. He estimated that output from the main UK oilfield Buzzard was now just over 200,000 barrels per day. UK GRADES * Forties: For the second consecutive day BP sold a cargo to Morgan Stanley. The level was dated plus 50 cents for loading 29-31 October. This was up around 20 cents from the previous session. * BP has sold six cargoes so far this week after acquiring a large portion of the Forties October programme. * Harding: Maersk was heard offering this grade on Thursday NORWEGIAN CRUDE * Ekofisk: Offered by at dated plus $3.25/$3.30 * Flotta: Will load two cargoes in November, making daily output 41,670 barrels.

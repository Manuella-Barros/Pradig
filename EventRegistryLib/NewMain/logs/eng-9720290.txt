Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles. AP journalists Anita Snow in Phoenix; Ty O'Neil in Death Valley, California; Rio Yamat in Las Vegas; and Scott Sonner and Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so into the week.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Used to shrugging off the heat, Las Vegas residents are now eyeing the thermometer as the desert city is on track Wednesday to set a record for the most consecutive days over 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46.1 Celsius) amid a lingering hot spell that will continue scorching much of the U.S. into the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, Las Vegas flirted again with the all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C) reached on Sunday, but settled for a new daily mark of 119 F (48.3 C) that smashed the old one of 116 F (46.6 C) set for the date in 2021. Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

Used to shrugging off the heat, Las Vegas residents are now eyeing the thermometer as the desert city is on track Wednesday to set a record for the most consecutive days over 115 degrees (46.1 C) amid a lingering hot spell that's expected to continue scorching much of the U.S. into the weekend.\n\nBy Ken Ritter and Scott Sonner, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, July 10, 2024 | 2 a.m.\n\nUsed to shrugging off the heat, Las Vegas residents are now eyeing the thermometer as the desert city is on track Wednesday to set a record for the most consecutive days over 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46.1 Celsius) amid a lingering hot spell that will continue scorching much of the U.S. into the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, Las Vegas flirted again with the all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C) reached on Sunday, but settled for a new daily mark of 119 F (48.3 C) that smashed the old one of 116 F (46.6 C) set for the date in 2021. Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.\n\n___\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.", "source": {"uri": "abc30.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC30 News"}, "authors":

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said.

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nRELATED STORY | Scorching heat wave creates deadly conditions in national parks\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F.\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F, recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F. Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet, the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news",

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1\u00b0C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115\u00b0F (46.1\u00b0C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the US also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the US were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120\u00b0F (48.9\u00b0C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like.... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130\u00b0F (54.4\u00b0C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5\u00b0C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116\u00b0F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106\u00b0F (41.1\u00b0C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe US heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest US through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.", "source": {"uri":

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Mr. Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Ms. Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Mr. Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nMs. Skains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16 percent contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity, and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"},

Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada\u00b4s largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas.

More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist\u00b4s death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries.

This record pertains to the number of consecutive days where the temperature has exceeded 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46.1 Celsius). The scorching heatwave affecting Las Vegas is not limited to the city alone, as much of the United States will continue to experience high temperatures through the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, Las Vegas flirted again with the all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C) reached on Sunday, but settled for a new daily mark of 119 F (48.3 C) that smashed the old one of 116 F (46.6 C) set for the date in 2021. Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John air, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And air said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108. The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week, although the end of the siege was in sight in some areas.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120.\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world, with a temperature of 130, recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 and Salem and Eugene hitting 105.\n\nThe Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday confirmed two new suspected heat-related deaths, bringing to eight the total number of deaths during the heat-wave. One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman. The youngest was 33 but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nThe National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks at the Grand Canyon, where temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 in the shade. Bystanders and medical staff on Sunday unsuccessfully attempted CPR on the 50-year-old man, the park service said.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 set in 1958.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 3.6-square-miles Vista Fire chewed through trees in the Mount Baldy area of the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.\n\n___\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115 F (46.1 C) set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nKeith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.\n\n\"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day,\" Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. But officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C). The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week, although the end of the siege was in sight in some areas.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday confirmed two new suspected heat-related deaths, bringing to eight the total number of deaths during the heat-wave. One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman. The youngest was 33 but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nThe National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks at the Grand Canyon, where temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade. Bystanders and medical staff on Sunday unsuccessfully attempted CPR on the 50-year-old man, the park service said.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile (117-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.", "source": {"uri": "eastidahonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Idaho News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Sunday, the heat wave set Las Vegas' all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nKeith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.\n\n\"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day,\" Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. But officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C). The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week, although the end of the siege was in sight in some areas.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday confirmed two new suspected heat-related deaths, bringing to eight the total number of deaths during the heat-wave. One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman. The youngest was 33 but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nThe National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks at the Grand Canyon, where temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade. Bystanders and medical staff on Sunday unsuccessfully attempted CPR on the 50-year-old man, the park service said.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 F (45.5 C) after it hit 116 F (46.6 C) on Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 F (43.8 C). Police Capt. Tim Brunenkant said the car apparently was left running and the air conditioning was functional, but it was unclear how long the girl was by herself.\n\nIn Lake Havasu, Arizona, a 4-month-old baby died from heat-related complications Friday after becoming unconscious during a boating trip, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said. The temperature that day hit 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile (117-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rio Yamat in Las Vegas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Scott Sonner and Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada;

Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so into the week.\n\nBy KEN RITTER and CHRISTOPHER WEBER - Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- Used to shrugging off the heat, Las Vegas residents are now eyeing the thermometer as the desert city is on track Wednesday to set a record for the most consecutive days over 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46.1 Celsius) amid a lingering hot spell that will continue scorching much of the U.S. into the weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, Las Vegas flirted again with the all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C) reached on Sunday, but settled for a new daily mark of 119 F (48.3 C) that smashed the old one of 116 F (46.6 C) set for the date in 2021. Forecasters say the city will likely hit a record fifth straight day above 115 F (46.1 C) on Wednesday.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a mid-day blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nDeath Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles. AP journalists Anita Snow in Phoenix; Ty O'Neil in Death Valley, California; Rio Yamat in Las Vegas; and Scott Sonner and Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And the record could be extended, or even doubled, by the weekend.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented, with forecasters calling it \"the most extreme heat wave\" since the National Weather Service began keeping records in Las Vegas in 1937.\n\nAlready the city has broken 16 heat records since June 1, well before the official start of summer, \"and we're not even halfway through July yet,\" meteorologist Morgan Stessman said Wednesday. That includes an all-time high of 120 F (48.8 C) set on Sunday, which beat the previous 117 F (47.2 C) record.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has felt the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. She said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. Officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nFor homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nThe Las Vegas area has been under an excessive heat warning on three separate occasions this summer, totaling about 12 days of dangerous heat with little relief even after the sun goes down, Stessman said.\n\nKeith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at a Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs, Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.\n\n\"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day,\" Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.\n\nMore than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states, where dozens of locations tied or broke heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nOregon has seen record daily high temperatures, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C) on Tuesday. The high temperatures are suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. The youngest was 33, but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C). The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I wanted to experience what it would feel like,\" Pell said. \"It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nAt the Grand Canyon, the National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks. Temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 F (45.5 C) after it hit 116 F (46.6 C) Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 F (43.8 C). Police Capt. Tim Brunenkant said the car apparently was left running and the air conditioning was functional, but it was unclear how long the girl was by herself.\n\nIn Lake Havasu, Arizona, a 4-month-old baby died from heat-related complications Friday after becoming unconscious during a boating trip, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said. The temperature that day hit 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \" polar pods, \" devices filled with water and ice to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile (117-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rio Yamat in Las Vegas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Scott Sonner and Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada;

On Sunday, the heat wave set Las Vegas' all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nKeith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs, Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.\n\n\"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day,\" Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. She said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and she waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. Officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nFor homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nMore than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states, where dozens of locations tied or broke heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nOregon has seen record daily high temperatures, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C) on Tuesday. The high temperatures are suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. The youngest was 33, but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C). The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I wanted to experience what it would feel like,\" Pell said. \"It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nAt the Grand Canyon, the National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks. Temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 F (45.5 C) after it hit 116 F (46.6 C) Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 F (43.8 C). Police Capt. Tim Brunenkant said the car apparently was left running and the air conditioning was functional, but it was unclear how long the girl was by herself.\n\nIn Lake Havasu, Arizona, a 4-month-old baby died from heat-related complications Friday after becoming unconscious during a boating trip, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said. The temperature that day hit 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \" polar pods, \" devices filled with water and ice to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile (117-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rio Yamat in Las Vegas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Scott Sonner and Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada;

And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a charter school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused six deaths, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday. More than 161 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Tuesday, especially in Western states.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park.

The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C). Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nPhoenix, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116 F (46.6) set in 1958.\n\nThe high Tuesday of 106 F (41.1 C) in Reno, Nevada, broke the daily record of 104 F (40 C) last tied in 2017 and extended to four days the longest streak ever of 105 F (40.5 C) or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 feet (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said.

But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles, including battalion chiefs in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat and a longstanding drought in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of The Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-square-mile (109-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara County. The Lake Fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and northwest winds developing late in the day.\n\nNortheast of Los Angeles, the 2-square-mile (5-square-kilometer) Vista Fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino National Forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest U.S. through Saturday morning.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the service in Reno said.\n\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

A counselor at a school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. But officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C). The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nDozens of locations across the West tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week, although the end of the siege was in sight in some areas.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday confirmed two new suspected heat-related deaths, bringing to eight the total number of deaths during the heat-wave. One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman. The youngest was 33 but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nThe National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks at the Grand Canyon, where temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade. Bystanders and medical staff on Sunday unsuccessfully attempted CPR on the 50-year-old man, the park service said.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 F (45.5 C) after it hit 116 F (46.6 C) on Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 F (43.8 C). Police Capt. Tim Brunenkant said the car apparently was left running and the air conditioning was functional, but it was unclear how long the girl was by herself.\n\nIn Lake Havasu, Arizona, a 4-month-old baby died from heat-related complications Friday after becoming unconscious during a boating trip, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said. The temperature that day hit 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile (117-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rio Yamat in Las Vegas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Scott Sonner and Gabe Stern in Reno, Nevada;

And the record could be extended, or even doubled, by the weekend.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented, with forecasters calling it \"the most extreme heat wave\" since the National Weather Service began keeping records in Las Vegas in 1937.\n\nAlready the city has broken 16 heat records since June 1, well before the official start of summer, \"and we're not even halfway through July yet,\" meteorologist Morgan Stessman said Wednesday. That includes an all-time high of 120 degrees set on Sunday, which beat the previous 117 degree record.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has felt the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. She said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized. There have been at least nine heat-related deaths this year in Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, according to the county coroner's office. Officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nFor homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nThe Las Vegas area has been under an excessive heat warning on three separate occasions this summer, totaling about 12 days of dangerous heat with little relief even after the sun goes down, Stessman said.\n\nKeith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at a Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs, Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.\n\n\"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day,\" Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.\n\nRELATED STORY | This June was the 2nd-hottest on record, weather agency says\n\nMore than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states, where dozens of locations tied or broke heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nOregon has seen record daily high temperatures, with Portland reaching 103 degrees and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 degrees on Tuesday. The high temperatures are suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. The youngest was 33, but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 degrees for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 degrees. The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park. At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 degrees.\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I wanted to experience what it would feel like,\" Pell said. \"It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nAt the Grand Canyon, the National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks. Temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 degrees in the shade.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 degrees after it hit 116 degrees Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 degrees. Police Capt. Tim Brunenkant said the car apparently was left running and the air conditioning was functional, but it was unclear how long the girl was by herself.\n\nIn Lake Havasu, Arizona, a 4-month-old baby died from heat-related complications Friday after becoming unconscious during a boating trip, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said. The temperature that day hit 120 degrees.\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods, \" devices filled with water and ice to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 homes in the mountains of Santa Barbara County.\n\nRELATED STORY | Wildfires rage in California as heat wave bakes much of the Western US", "source": {"uri": "abc15.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Used to shrugging off the heat, Las Vegas residents are now eyeing the thermometer as the desert city is on track Wednesday to set a record for the most consecutive days over 115 degrees (46.1 C) amid a lingering hot spell that's expected to continue scorching much of the U.S. into the weekend. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\n\nLas Vegas baked Wednesday in a record fifth consecutive day of temperatures sizzling at 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46.1 Celsius) or greater amid a lengthening hot spell that is expected to broil much of the U.S. into the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe temperature climbed to 115 at 1:13 p.m. at Harry Reid International Airport, breaking the old mark of four consecutive days. On Sunday, the heat wave set Las Vegas' all-time temperature record of 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nKeith Bailey and Lee Doss met early Wednesday morning at Las Vegas park to beat the heat and exercise their dogs Breakie, Ollie and Stanley.\n\n\"If I don't get out by 8:30 in the morning, then it's not going to happen that day,\" Bailey said, wearing a sunhat while the dogs played in the grass.\n\nAlyse Sobosan said this July has been the hottest in the 15 years she has lived in Las Vegas. A counselor at a school that's on summer break, Sobosan said she doesn't step outside during the day if she can help it, and waits until 9 p.m. or later to walk her dogs.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" she said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nIt's also dangerously hot, health officials have emphasized.

At Death Valley on Tuesday, tourists queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120 F (48.9 C).\n\nSimon Pell and Lisa Gregory from London left their air-conditioned RV to experience a midday blast of heat that would be unthinkable back home.\n\n\"I don't need a thermometer to tell me that it's hot,\" Pell said. \"You hear about it in stories and and wildlife documentaries. But just for me, I wanted to experience what it would feel like. ... It's an incredible experience.\"\n\nRecord highs for the date were also hit Tuesday in parts of Oregon and Washington, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office on Wednesday confirmed two new suspected heat-related deaths, bringing to eight the total number of deaths during the heat-wave. One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman. The youngest was 33 but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nThe National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks at the Grand Canyon, where temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade. Bystanders and medical staff on Sunday unsuccessfully attempted CPR on the 50-year-old man, the park service said.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 F (45.5 C) after it hit 116 F (46.6 C) on Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 F (43.8 C).

They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 19 wildfires Wednesday, including a 45-square-mile (117-square-kilometer) blaze that prompted evacuation

Even by desert standards, the prolonged baking the city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heatwave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada.\n\nTuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115F set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nThe extended heatwave comes with serious dangers, health officials have emphasized.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nWhile hotels and casinos kept visitors cool with giant AC units, the scorching heat presented acute danger for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments.\n\nOfficials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada. Firefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\".\n\nThe pods, first deployed in Phoenix can be filled with water and ice to immerse a medical patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nThe intense heatwave hitting Vegas has been searing much of the US west in recent days, with several places setting heat records, and reporting fatalities.\n\nIn Oregon, the city of Portland saw record daily temperatures on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and Salem set a new record, hitting 103F on Sunday. The excessive temperatures are suspected to have caused six deaths in the state, the state medical examiner's office said Tuesday.\n\nIn California, the heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death in Death Valley National Park. Death Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134F in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130F, recorded there in July 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, tourists visiting the park queued for photos in front of a giant thermometer that was reading 120F.\n\nPhoenix, Arizona, which has averaged the hottest temperature ever for the first eight days of July in records dating to 1885, tied the daily record Tuesday of 116F set in 1958. Triple digit temperatures were also recorded in Idaho.\n\nReno, Nevada, broke its daily record with 104F on Tuesday, and was suffering through the longest streak ever of days hitting 105F or higher. Before this week, at an elevation of 4,500 ft (1,372 meters), the city had never been that hot for more than two consecutive days in records dating to 1888.\n\nThe US heat wave comes as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5C (2.7FF) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nExtreme heat is exacerbating the threat of wildfires across the US west, where a longstanding drought has dried out vegetation that fuels the blazes.\n\nA new fire in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek fire, quickly grew to more than 5 sq miles (12 sq km) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco county. Evacuations were ordered for remote homes about 15 miles (24km) south of the Dalles.\n\nIn California, firefighters were battling least 18 wildfires Tuesday, including a 42-sq-mile blaze that prompted evacuation orders for about 200 residences in the mountains of Santa Barbara county.\n\nThat blaze, called the Lake fire was only 16% contained, and forecasters warned of a \"volatile combination\" of high heat, low humidity and north-west winds developing late in the day.\n\nAnd northeast of Los Angeles, the 2-sq-mile Vista fire chewed through trees in the San Bernardino national forest and sent up a huge plume of smoke visible across the region.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warnings across most of the Southwest US through Saturday morning.",

Officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nFor homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nMore than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states, where dozens of locations tied or broke heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so all week.\n\nOregon has seen record daily high temperatures, with Portland reaching 103 F (39.4 C) and Salem and Eugene hitting 105 F (40.5 C) on Tuesday. The high temperatures are suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. The youngest was 33, but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C). The warning was due to expire at 8 p.m. Wednesday, though forecasters said there may be a need to extend it.\n\nThe heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death over the weekend in Death Valley National Park.

But officials say the toll is likely higher.\n\n\"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot its hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nThe searing heat wave gripping large parts of the U.S. also led to record daily high temperatures in Oregon, where it is suspected to have caused eight deaths, the state medical examiner's office said. More than 142 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Wednesday, especially in Western states.\n\nOn the other side of the nation, the National Weather Service warned of major-to-extreme heat risk over portions of the East Coast.\n\nAn excessive heat warning remained in place Wednesday for the Philadelphia area, northern Delaware and nearly all of New Jersey. Temperatures were around 90 F (32.2 C) for most of the region, and forecasters warned the heat index could soar as high as 108 F (42.2 C).

One was an 83-year-old man in Washington County and the other was a 72-year-old man in Multnomah County. Seven of the deaths were men and one was a woman. The youngest was 33 but all of the others were age 64 and older.\n\nThe National Park Service was investigating the third hiker death in recent weeks at the Grand Canyon, where temperatures on parts of some trails can reach 120 F (49 C) in the shade. Bystanders and medical staff on Sunday unsuccessfully attempted CPR on the 50-year-old man, the park service said.\n\nAn excessive heat warning continued Wednesday in many parts of southern and central Arizona. Forecasters said the high in Phoenix was expected to reach 114 F (45.5 C) after it hit 116 F (46.6 C) on Tuesday, tying the previous record for the date set in 1958.\n\nIn Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, authorities were investigating the death of a 2-year-old girl who was left alone in a vehicle on a Tuesday afternoon where the high hit 111 F (43.8 C). Police Capt. Tim Brunenkant said the car apparently was left running and the air conditioning was functional, but it was unclear how long the girl was by herself.\n\nIn Lake Havasu, Arizona, a 4-month-old baby died from heat-related complications Friday after becoming unconscious during a boating trip, the Mohave County Sheriff's Department said. The temperature that day hit 120 F (48.8 C).\n\nThe U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June was a record warm for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said. Most of this heat, trapped by human-caused climate change, is from long-term warming from greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, scientists say.\n\nIn Las Vegas, hotels and casinos keep their visitors cool with massive AC units. But for homeless residents and others without access to safe environments, officials have set up emergency cooling centers at community centers across southern Nevada.\n\nFirefighters in Henderson, Nevada, last week became the first in the region to deploy what city spokesperson Madeleine Skains called \"polar pods\" used to cool a person exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke or a related medical emergency.\n\nSkains said four vehicles in the city of more than 330,000 residents have the devices that are similar to units first put into use a month ago in Phoenix. They can be filled with water and ice to immerse a patient in cold water on the way to a hospital.\n\nExtreme heat in the West has also dried out vegetation that fuels wildfires.\n\nA new blaze in Oregon, dubbed the Larch Creek Fire, quickly grew to more than 5 square miles (12 square kilometers) Tuesday evening as flames tore through grassland in Wasco County.

Even by desert standards, the prolonged baking the city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heatwave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada. Tuesday's high temperature tied the mark of four straight days above 115F set in July 2005. And Adair said the record could be extended through Friday.\n\nThe extended heatwave comes with serious dangers, health officials have emphasized. \"Even people of average age who are seemingly healthy can suffer heat illness when it's so hot it's hard for your body to cool down,\" said Alexis Brignola, an epidemiologist at the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nEDIT\n\nIn Oregon, the city of Portland saw record daily temperatures on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and Salem set a new record, hitting 103F on Sunday. The excessive temperatures are suspected to have caused six deaths in the state, the state medical examiner's office said on Tuesday. In California, the heat was blamed for a motorcyclist's death in the Death Valley national park. Death Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134F in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130F, recorded there in July 2021.\n\nEDIT\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/10/las-vegas-heatwave-record-temperature", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adair_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adair County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salem, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salem, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720290", "eventUri": "eng-9720290", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 667, "textEnd": 676}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

In California and Oregon, officials have confirmed eight suspected heat-related deaths since last week.\n\nIn Las Vegas, the heat has turned the Strip, usually a bustling tourist destination during the summer months, into a pedestrian ghost town. \"It's so hot,\" said Phylicia Allen, who works at a frozen drinks stand near the Strip. \"It's super slow for a Tuesday.\"\n\nAllen, who moved to Nevada from San Diego a decade ago, says she doesn't look at the thermometer. \"I measure it by 'hot,' to 'hotter,' to 'hottest.'\" she said. \"Right now, we're in 'hottest.'\"\n\nThe record temperatures may be dissuading tourists, said Andrea Montibeller, a visitor from Guanajuato, Mexico. \"I feel like I opened the oven door, and I feel the hot air rushing onto my face,\" Montibeller said. \"I think my eyelashes will burn off.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylicia_Rashad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phylicia Rashad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghost town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanajuato", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guanajuato"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guanajuato"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/9cd6dff676357cba2bb0861e371e7efe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720290", "eventUri": "eng-9720290", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

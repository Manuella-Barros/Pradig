{"id": 225002980, "title": "Southwest monsoon onset over Kerala during next 24 hours: IMD", "text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday that the Southwest Monsoon will likely hit the Kerala coast on Thursday. A week ago, the IMD predicted the onset over Kerala on May 31 whereas the normal date is June 1 (with a standard deviation of 7 days). \"Conditions continue to become favourable for the onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala during the next 24 hours,\" the IMD said. Heavy rainfall has continued across Kerala for a fortnight now \u2014 the state received 39 per cent (465 mm) surplus rainfall during March-May, of which over 90 per cent was realised in May. This year, the Bay of Bengal branch of the monsoon is sufficiently strong, and it could facilitate an early monsoon advancement into the Northeastern states. The normal monsoon onset date over Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur and Assam is June 5. If an early monsoon advance is realised over the eastern states, the recovery from the existing flood situation, landslides and overflowing river banks in the aftermath of Cyclone Remal will only worsen. Remnants of the storm continue to prevail as a cyclonic circulation over the region. Besides, the monsoon is set to further advance into more areas of the Arabian Sea, the remaining areas of Maldives, Comorin, Lakshadweep, southwest Bay of Bengal northeast Bay of Bengal, and the Northeastern states. The IMD follows a set of prescribed ocean-atmospheric parameters to declare the monsoon onset over Kerala. The latest criteria came into effect in 2016. Anytime after May 10, the rainfall over 14 stations in Kerala and neighbouring areas for two consecutive days should be over 2.5mm, the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), the depth of the westerly winds, be upto 600 hPa indicating the strength of the monsoon winds. Once these criteria are met, the IMD declares the monsoon onset over Kerala. This year, the monsoon advancement over the southern peninsular India was likely to be swift and on time, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Director General, IMD, said earlier this week. On the other hand, a delayed onset over North and Northwest India is on the cards. Here, heatwave conditions have been forecast for 3 to 6 days during June.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/southwest-monsoon-onset-kerala-imd-9359372/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/PTI05_28_2024_000073B.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:12:08", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.149}

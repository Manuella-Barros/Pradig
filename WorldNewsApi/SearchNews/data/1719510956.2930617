The proud parents welcomed the tot into the world on May 14, following months of speculation about whether mum-of-two, 'Amzie', was expecting. The couple, who got married in 2021, have been in a baby bubble at their home in London since welcoming little Wilder, who is Ant's first child. As Ant takes a break from work, he and Anne Marie decided to take the tot out for some fresh air today as they were snapped pushing a designer pram in a park in South West London. Britain's Got Talent star, Ant, 48, looked every inch the proud dad as he pushed the buggy, sporting grey slacks, a multi-coloured shirt and shades. Anne-Marie, 46, who has two daughters from her previous marriage, also cut a casual figure, wearing a loose-fitting sky blue dress, navy cardigan and trainers. The couple, who held hands in the snaps, were accompanied by their beloved Maltipoo dogs, Bumble and Milo. Following the birth of his son when Ant told fans \"mummy was amazing\" and \"dad's a mess\", the TV star was back at work a week later. Rocking up on the red carpet for the Prince's Trust Awards with his best pal, Declan Donnelly, the Geordie showed no signs of tiredness as he posed for photos at London's Theatre Royal on Drury Lane. However, he missed the reception for the awards at Buckingham Palace, leaving his sidekick Dec to explain his absence. King Charles was informed by the Byker Grove star that his celebrity partner was missing from the bash because he was breastfeeding. One half of the Ant and Dec double act, apologised to Charles on behalf of his friend, who was looking after his newborn son. Dec said after meeting the monarch: \u201cI passed on Ant\u2019s apology that he couldn\u2019t be here today because he was at home breastfeeding.\u201d He added with a laugh: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I broke royal protocol by giving that information.\u201d Commenting on rumours he was the newborn\u2019s godfather, Dec said he had not been formally asked, adding: \u201cEverybody else has presumed, I won\u2019t presume.\" Ant announced the birth of his son on Instagram with a black and white image of him holding his new son, Wilder Patrick McPartlin, close to his chest. As his followers and celebrity pals shared messages of congratulations following his joyous news, others reacted to Ant's never-seen-before tattoo, which included the name of his wife and his stepdaughters. As depicted in the reveal photo, the host has a sizeable family tree on his shoulder and hidden within the branches are six names - Amzie, Daisy, Poppy, Bumble, Milo and Hurley. The ink holds great sentimental value to the I'm A Celebrity star, as they are the names not only of his family, but also of his beloved dogs.

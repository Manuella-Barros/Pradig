{"id": 237086634, "title": "This week's Yankees-Orioles showdown could be the start of an epic race for the AL East title", "text": "The New York Yankees played last weekend at Fenway Park against rival Boston. The Baltimore Orioles hosted three straight sellouts against Philadelphia in a series matching two of the top teams in baseball. And that was somehow just the undercard. Now for the main event: Starting on Tuesday night, New York hosts Baltimore for three games between the two clubs that have already opened up a big gap on the rest of the AL East. The Yankees are on pace to win 109 games, the Orioles 107. With only the division champion eligible to earn a postseason first-round bye, this could be the start of a compelling AL East title race. \u201cI think it should be fun,\u201d Baltimore outfielder Colton Cowser said. \u201cI think that any chance you go into Yankee Stadium, especially with the year they\u2019re having, it\u2019s going to be a really good environment.\u201d The tale of the tape is as follows: The Yankees (50-24) have the best record in baseball; the Orioles (47-24) will be second or third depending on Philadelphia\u2019s result Monday night. The Yankees have the game\u2019s top run differential and the Orioles are second. The Orioles are No. 1 in home runs and runs per game and the Yankees are No. 2 in both categories. The Yankees lead the major leagues in ERA and the Orioles are No. 2. Baltimore, last year\u2019s division champ, has not lost any of its past 21 series against AL East foes, going 15-0-6. That includes winning three of four over the Yankees at Camden Yards about six weeks ago. \u201cI think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable, but at the same time, it is a marathon. We\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d New York manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cI think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.\u201d Both teams rely on the long ball. New York\u2019s Aaron Judge leads the majors with 26, and sure enough it\u2019s a Baltimore player \u2014 Gunnar Henderson \u2014 in second place with 22. Juan Soto has 18 homers and Giancarlo Stanton 17 for the Yankees. The Orioles have five players with at least 11. New York and Baltimore have faced significant pitching injuries \u2014 but in different ways. Reigning Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole hasn\u2019t pitched yet this season for the Yankees because of elbow nerbe inflammation, but the rest of the rotation has stepped up and five New York pitchers have started 70 of 74 games. The Orioles have had a healthy ace in Corbin Burnes, but the list of injuries to the rest of their staff is lengthy, with F\u00e9lix Bautista, John Means and Tyler Wells out for the season and Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer currently on the injured list. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good team. They\u2019re very complete. They\u2019ve had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThey continue to get good starting pitching, been able to close out games and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\u201d Burnes pitched Sunday against the Phillies and promising second-year right-hander Grayson Rodriguez worked Saturday. So the Yankees aren\u2019t slated to face either of them. Instead the Orioles have Albert Su\u00e1rez, a journeyman who has posted a 1.61 ERA this year, starting the series opener. Then rookie Cade Povich makes his third big league start, followed by lefty Cole Irvin. The Yankees start Nestor Cortes on Tuesday and breakout star Luis Gil on Thursday. As for Wednesday, that\u2019s now set for Cole\u2019s return, which will add even more buzz to a series that already had plenty. \u201cLooking forward to it, another great ballclub,\u201d Judge said. \u201cExcited to see them in the Bronx. It\u2019s going to be a fun series. The fans are going to be excited. We\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3lhbmtlZXMtb3Jpb2xlcy1zZXJpZXMtMDk1ZjJjZDgwOTU2NTczMDEyOWI0MWExNzcxZmRlODbSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">This week's Yankees-Orioles showdown could be the start of an epic race for the AL East title</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/yankees-orioles-series-095f2cd809565730129b41a1771fde86", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/406fdda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4194x2359+0+218/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F4d%2F58%2F18266ca93e859422ad7f2f3c8e29%2F67a9890d6e11417097f73ca1e006c961", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:52:46", "author": "Noah Trister", "authors": ["Noah Trister"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.161}

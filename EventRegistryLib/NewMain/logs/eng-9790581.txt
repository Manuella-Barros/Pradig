'That's a big deal.'\n\nMs Amir said investors were now expecting three US rate cuts in 2024, amid fears a slower reaction from the US Fed would spark a recession.\n\n'We've got slowdown concerns,'

4.28 per cent over June 14-15, 2022, amid anticipation of super-sized US central bank rate hikes.\n\nBut there were surprises with sleep apnea machine market Resmed up 4.1 per cent to $33.10 as

Rowe Price portfolio manager Scott Solomon.\n\n\"Markets saw a nearly 50 per cent chance of a hike by the RBA before the end of the year get completely turned on its head, with markets now pricing nearly a 100 per cent chance of a cut before the year is out.\"\n\nAfter the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.43 per cent on Wall Street on Friday, IT stocks led the way down on the ASX, down 6.61 per cent. The remaining 10 industrial sectors were also more than 1.5 per cent in the red.\n\nAustralia's biggest company by market capitalisation, BHP, was down 2.1 per cent, while fellow iron miner Fortescue fell 1.9 per cent and Rio Tinto edged 0.1 per cent lower.\n\nTraders laid waste to the Big Four banks, with CBA down 5.7 per cent, NAB falling 4.6 per cent and ANZ and Westpac both ending 4.5 per cent lower.\n\nOil and gas giant Woodside fell 3.6 per cent to a two-and-a-half year low of $26.48 amid reports the proposed $30 billion-plus Browse development off Western Australia failed to get state environmental approval.\n\nHealth care stocks were the least worst hit, falling 1.8 per cent.\n\nSleep apnoea device manufacturer ResMed was one of Monday's few winners, up 2.9 per cent to $32.73 after reporting positive earnings results last week.\n\nBut it was not so positive for private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care, which retreated 0.3 per cent after flagging its full-year earnings, to be announced later in August, will be weaker than expected.\n\nOne Australian dollar slumped to 64.08 US cents, after buying 65.25 US cents at Friday's ASX close.\n\nON THE ASX:\n\n* The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished Monday down 293.6 points, or 3.7 per cent, at 7,649.6.\n\n* The broader All Ordinaries fell 311 points, or 3.81 per cent, to 7,859.4.\n\nCURRENCY SNAPSHOT:\n\nOne Australian dollar buys:\n\n* 66.40 US cents, from 65.25 US cents at Friday's ASX close\n\n* 91.32 Japanese yen, from 97.20 Japanese yen\n\n* 58.68 Euro cents, from 60.41 Euro cents\n\n* 50.32 British pence, from 51.22 pence\n\n* 108.66 NZ cents, from 109.49 NZ cents.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_selling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Panic selling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P/ASX_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P/ASX 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ordinaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All Ordinaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Australia Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rowe_Price", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy.\n\nUntil Friday, there had been relatively few huge market swings in the past year.\n\nA bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But professional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut interest rates and other big questions.\n\nOn Monday, the Nikkei closed down 4,451.28 points at 31,458.42. It had dropped 5.8 per cent on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9 per cent, on Oct. 19, 1987, a global markets crash that was dubbed \"Black Monday\" but proved to be only a temporary setback despite fears it might have augured a worldwide downturn.\n\nEuropean markets also opened lower Monday, with Germany's DAX down 2.3 per cent at 17,267.00. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.9 per cent to 7,114.33 and the FTSE 100 in London was 2.1 per cent lower at 8,004.19.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.5 per cent lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6 per cent.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8 per cent from a year ago.\n\nThe Japanese yen also has fallen sharply, trading at 142.37 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0952 from $1.0923.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 10.3 per cent. It closed 8.8 per cent lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4 per cent as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8 per cent.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up 105 per cent as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 17 per cent at $52,100.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up $1.41 to $72.11 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.35 cents to $75.46 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2 per cent to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7 per cent to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5 per cent to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8 per cent decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1 per cent since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4 per cent, taking it to 10 per cent below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The index's biggest-ever drop occurred on Oct 24, 2008, in the midst of the global financial crisis when shares dived 8.3 per cent.\n\nLocal banks led the losses in value terms on Aug 5, with DBS ending 5.8 per cent lower at $33.27, while UOB lost 5.5 per cent to $30.08 and OCBC Bank fell 5.3 per cent to $14.02.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged 12.4 per cent as investor confidence crumbled on a surge in the yen, tighter monetary policy and broader concern about the US economy.\n\nIt was the worst day for the Nikkei since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Its loss of 4,451.28 points was also the largest in its history. Japan also entered a bear market, as the Nikkei was down more than 20 per cent from its most recent high.\n\n\"It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,\" Mr Suzuki told reporters, adding that the authorities were monitoring stock market moves with \"grave concern\".\n\nThe surge in the yen since the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised interest rates on July 31 has cast a pall over the earnings outlook for Japan's exporters. Even insurers and banks that were expected to benefit from higher rates are now some of the biggest losers since the BOJ's hike as global equity markets slump.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi index plunged 8.8 per cent, while Australia's S&P/ASX200 tumbled 3.7 per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 1.5 per cent, while the Shanghai Composite ended down 1.5 per cent.\n\nNasdaq futures sank 4.1 per cent, while S&P 500 futures dropped 2.5 per cent.\n\nEuropean stocks fell sharply in early trading with London's FTSE 100 down 2.2 per cent.\n\nThe market rout underscores how quickly sentiment has shifted away from expectations that the Federal Reserve will be able to engineer a soft landing for the US economy.\n\nIt comes after data on Aug 2 showed the US economy added far fewer jobs than expected in June, while the jobless rate unexpectedly climbed for a fourth month to 4.3 per cent, above the Fed's year-end forecast, triggering a closely watched recession indicator.\n\nA day earlier, lacklustre US manufacturing data stoked concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held borrowing costs at more than two-decade highs too long.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group economists increased the probability of a recession in the US over the next 12 months to 25 per cent from 15 per cent but said there were several reasons not to fear a slump, even after US unemployment jumped.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan were more bearish, subscribing a 50 per cent probability to a US recession.\n\nTraders are projecting the Fed will cut rates by more than a full percentage point in 2024, with an increased chance of an outsized 50 basis-point cut in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAsia markets were also feeling the pain from a global tech rout which sent the Nasdaq index in the US down more than 10 per cent from its highs into correction territory last week.\n\nMeanwhile, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also sapped risk appetite as Israel braced itself for a possible attack from Iran and regional militias in retaliation for assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas officials.\n\nOil prices started firmer amid concerns about a widening conflict in the Middle East, but worries about global demand soon dragged them down again.\n\nBrent slipped 13 US cents to US$76.68 a barrel, while US crude lost 22 US cents to US$73.30 per barrel.\n\nInvestors ran for the safety of bonds. The huge drop in Treasury yields overshadowed the US dollar's usual safe-haven appeal and dragged the currency down 0.4 per cent on a basket of major currencies. The dollar shed another 2.2 per cent on the Japanese yen at 143.1 yen.\n\nThe Swiss franc was a major beneficiary of the rush from risk, with the dollar falling 0.9 per cent to touch six-month lows at 0.8485 franc.\n\n\"If the recession narrative takes hold in earnest, we would expect that to change, and the dollar to rebound as safe-haven demand becomes the dominant driver in currency markets,\" said Mr Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\n\nCryptocurrencies also reeled from risk aversion on Aug 5, with the Bitcoin plunging as much 16 per cent.\n\nGold prices whipsawed in volatile trading, though analysts said the commodity's safe-haven appeal remains strong as US recession fears mount.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.8 per cent at US$2,425.04 an ounce by 5pm Singapore time. - AGENCIES", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan",

Stock markets around the world -- the Sensex and the Nifty in India, the Nikkei 225 in Japan, Hang Seng in Hong Kong and the Straits Times Index in Singapore -- were awash in red on Monday, causing panic and fear across the world.\n\nTrading boards across Asia showed a sea of red, prompting futures trading to be suspended for some time as a so-called \"circuit-breaker\" on the Nikkei and Topix indexes on the Osaka Exchange in Japan's western metropolis.\n\nBut how badly did the markets crash? And what led to this crash? We investigate and try to get you the answers.\n\nBloodbath at Dalal Street\n\nIndia's stock market tumbled on Monday just as it opened, with the Sensex crashing 2,686.09 points, or 3.31 per cent to 78,295.86 during the afternoon trade. The NSE Nifty tumbled 824 points or 3.33 per cent to 23,893.70.\n\nInvestors' wealth eroded by Rs 17.11 lakh crore during the afternoon trade to Rs 4,40,04,979.86 crore, reported news agency PTI.\n\nThis follows Friday's trend where the BSE benchmark plunged 885.60 points or 1.08 per cent to close at 80,981.95. The broader Nifty of NSE dropped 293.20 points or 1.17 per cent to end at 24,717.70.\n\nAsian markets stumble too\n\nBut the crash isn't limited to just the Indian stock market. Tokyo stocks sank more than 12 per cent, reported AFP, with Nikkei 225 index plunging 12.4 per cent, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 -- its largest points drop in history -- while the broader Topix index lost 12.23 per cent, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15.\n\nToday's fall was reminiscent of the \"Black Monday\" of October 1987 when Nikkei saw a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9 per cent. Notably, it suffered an 11.4 per cent drop in October 2008 during the global financial crisis and fell 10.6 per cent during the aftermath of massive earthquakes and nuclear meltdowns in northeastern Japan in March 2011.\n\nHeavyweight trading houses such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Co, Sumitomo and Marubeni all plunged over 14 per cent, with Mitsui seeing a wipeout of almost 20 per cent of its market cap, reported CNBC.\n\nAFP further reported that Seoul and Taipei plunged more than eight per cent each, while Singapore gave up more than four per cent and Sydney more than three per cent. It further stated that futures trading was temporarily suspended on the Nikkei and Topix indexes, on the Osaka Exchange and in Seoul in a bid to ease volatility. As per reports, the halt was for 20 minutes. Circuit breakers are activated if stocks rise or fall eight per cent.\n\nToday's decline followed Friday's fall when Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix fell more than five per cent and six per cent, respectively. The broader Topix marked its worst day in eight years, while the Nikkei marked its worst day since March 2020.\n\nA trend since Friday\n\nThe tumble in stocks began on Friday when the US stock market tumbled; the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 39,737.26, down 1.5 per cent for the day and 2.1 per cent for the week. On the same, day, European stock markets also closed sharply in the red: Amsterdam retreated by more than three per cent, Frankfurt 2.3 per cent, Paris 1.6 per cent and London 1.3 per cent.\n\nOn Friday (August 2), Tokyo led the losses with the Nikkei 225 tanking 5.8 per cent -- its biggest drop since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic four years ago. Hong Kong and Sydney were off more than two per cent, Seoul gave up more than three per cent and Taipei shed more than four per cent, with losses also in Shanghai, Mumbai and Singapore.\n\nReasons for the crash\n\nBut what's the reason for stocks markets across the world tumbling? The principal reason for this crash is fears that the US economy could be entering a recessionary phase. This worry emerged after data showed that US jobs growth slowed more than expected in July.\n\nIn July, the US added just 1,14,000 jobs, falling short of Wall Street's projection of 1,75,000. This data has fuelled concerns about a hard landing in the US and fears that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be behind the curve in avoiding a recession. The jobless rate rose to 4.3 per cent, the highest level since October 2021.\n\nSpeaking on the same, Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said, as per an AFP report: \"A sober market didn't need any more cold water poured on it, but that is exactly what it got with the July employment report, which was filled with ample headline disappointment.\"\n\nAnother reason for the crash, according to experts, is the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raising interest rates to 0.25 per cent. This pushed the value of Japanese yen higher against the US dollar -- the yen surged two per cent as it witnessed its highest level against the dollar since January. As CNN explains, a rising yen would hurt exporters and companies with overseas earnings.\n\nWhat has worsened the situation is the rise in tensions between Iran and Israel; there are indications that a full-blown war could break out as soon as even today. The escalation came after Ismail Haniyeh, a top Hamas leader, was assassinated when he was in Tehran to attend a government event. The Hindustan Times reports that an escalation in West Asia could push oil prices higher which are currently at eight-month lows as demand has fallen.\n\nAn Economic Times report added that after Nifty scaled the 25,000-level last week, it was succumbing to corrective pressure.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Experts at investment bank Goldman Sachs said they now believed there was a staggering 25 per cent chance of a recession in the US - up ten percent from their previous estimate of 15 per cent, while JP Morgan put the chances of a recession at 50 per cent.\n\nUS stock index futures tumbled on Monday, with those tied to the Nasdaq falling nearly 4 per cent, but traders are now ramping up bets that the Federal Reserve will announce an emergency interest rate cut in response to the global stock market crash and to avoid a huge recession. The sell-off followed the release of a dismal unemployment report last week. Employers added just 114,000 jobs last month, according to Labor Department data released Friday, far below the Dow Jones estimate of 185,000. The figure was the weakest since December last year and the second weakest since the start of the Covid pandemic in March 2020.\n\nRobert Carnell, from financial services firm ING, said: 'What we are looking at now is a situation where the market is viewing what's going on in the US macro economy as ticking the recession box.' The unemployment rate also edged higher to 4.3 percent - the highest level since October 2021. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo - the third largest in the world - crashed by 12 per cent this morning, the biggest single-day fall in almost four decades, while South Korea 's Kospi fell by nine per cent.\n\nMarkets in London, France, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines also fell by around two-and-three percent which prompted the triggering of circuit breakers - where the trading of stocks is paused for 20 minutes. It comes after the US Federal reserve on Wednesday decided not to slash interest rates from the 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent range which they have been frozen since July last year. Investors have shared concerns that the Federal Reserve may have left it too late to support the fragile US economy, warning that a US recession would cause chaos within other economies around the globe.\n\nIt would also spark mayhem during the upcoming November election, given the supreme importance of the economy to voters. It could turn the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris strongly in favor of Trump as the blame for the economic mess would be pinned on Harris and Joe Biden. A rate cut would make it easier for US households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through. However, Goldman Sachs' economists, led by Jan Hatzius, said that 'we continue to see recession risk as limited' because there are no major financial imbalances.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 plunged 12.40 per cent, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 - its biggest fall since 'Black Monday' in October 1986. The broader Topix index lost 12.23 per cent, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15. By the close on Monday, the index had wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792.32 billion) of the Nikkei market value since July 11, when it peaked at 42,426.77 - a drop of 27 per cent. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki declared today the government was cooperating with the central bank and closely monitoring markets with a sense of urgency. 'It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,' Suzuki told reporters, adding that authorities were watching stock market moves with 'grave concern'.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on Sunday he fears the US economy may be spiraling due to the Fed keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high since in its zeal to stifle inflation. Those hikes are now hitting the economy hard, he said, suggesting the Fed should have lowered rates earlier. 'I really do worry that we may lose US economic exceptionalism because of a policy mistake,' he told Bloomberg TV , as worldwide markets continued to plummet. Jim Reid, global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank, said there had been 'astonishing moves' in share prices, and 'markets are melting down in Asia'. 'Markets were on edge before Friday but a weak payrolls has really escalated a profound move across the globe,' he said. 'It's like the market has added up 2+2 and made 9,' he added.\n\nInvestors will get a read on employment in the service sector from the ISM non-manufacturing survey due later Monday and analysts are hoping for a rebound to 51.0 after June's unexpected slide to 48.8. The huge drop in Treasury yields had also overshadowed the US dollar's usual safe-haven appeal and dragged the currency down around one per cent on Friday. It comes after Warren Buffett dumped 55.8 per cent of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings of Apple stock in the first six months of 2024.\n\nApple Inc slumped 7.3 per cent after Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in the iPhone maker by almost 50 per cent, suggesting that the billionaire investor is growing wary about the broader US economy or stock market valuations that have gotten too high. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.5 per cent to 16,519.78 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.8 per cent to 7,637.40. The latest setback has been particularly damaging for markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, Samsung's shares sank 11.6 per cent. Taiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4 per cent as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8 per cent.\n\nAs the markets opened in Asia and Australia early Monday, NASDAQ futures dropped 2.27 percent, while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.41 percent. Early on Monday, the euro was holding steady at $1.0907. The Swiss franc was a major beneficiary of the rush from risk, with the dollar near six-month lows at 0.8586 francs . 'The shift in expected interest rate differentials against the US has outweighed the deterioration in risk sentiment,' said Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. 'If the recession narrative takes hold in earnest, we would expect that to change, and the dollar to rebound as safe-haven demand becomes the dominant driver in currency markets.'\n\nInvestors had also increased wagers other major central banks would follow the Fed's lead and ease more aggressively, with the European Central Bank now seen cutting by 67 basis points by Christmas. In commodity markets, gold was steady at $2,442 an ounce, supported by lower yields globally. Oil prices bounced amid concerns about a widening conflict in the Middle East, though worries about demand had seen it sink to eight-month lows last week. Brent gained 44 cents to $77.24 a barrel, while US crude rose 40 cents to $73.92 per barrel.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

"Aussie investors lose almost $100bn amid US recession fears", "body": "Fears of a recession in the United States has sent the Australian share market into freefall with a whopping $98 billion wiped off the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on Monday.\n\nThe staggering ASX drop of more than three and a half per cent on Monday puts Australia on track for its worst two-day decline since COVID-19 rattled the markets in 2020.\n\nAll of the four major banks are down more than four per cent while Wesfarmers is down about three and a half per cent, Woolworths has dropped about two and a half per cent and Coles has fallen over one and a half per cent.\n\nInformation technology stocks fared the worst on Monday with accounting software company Xero dropping about five and a half per cent, data centre giant NextDC plunging more than six per cent and fintech giant Block falling over 10 per cent.\n\nThe plunge comes as weak employment data in the United States over the weekend triggered the sell-off, according to Ernst & Young (EY) Oceania Chief Economist Cherelle Murphy.\n\n\"That negative sentiment about the state of the economy in the US has certainly translated somewhat into the markets here today,\" she told Sky News' Kieran Gilbert.\n\nHiring in the United States slowed in July as the unemployment rate jumped by 0.2 per cent to 4.3, bringing the figure to its highest point in three years.\n\nIn response to the new figures, Goldman Sachs economists hiked the likelihood of the US economy falling into recession from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.\n\nAsked how this will impact the Reserve Bank of Australia as it announces interest rates call on Tuesday, Ms Murphy said the stock market plunge will not be \"massively influential\" and pointed to core inflation data that came out on Wednesday last week.\n\n\"(Interest rates are) not looking a lot better (though) they're not looking worse,\" Ms Murphy said.\n\nOverseas the bloodbath was in full force with Japan's Nikkei 225 falling more than 10 per cent, while the NASDAQ Futures is down more than three and a half per cent and the Dow Jones Futures down almost one per cent.\n\nJapanese car producers fared poorly on Monday with Mitsubishi falling more than 10 per cent, taking about one trillion Yen (AU$10b) off its market cap, while Toyota reported a similar plunge.\n\nThe ASX's drop on Monday follows a 2.1 per cent fall on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type":

The fear of a reverse Yen carry trade, following an interest rate hike in Japan, was the initial catalyst. This was compounded by fears of a recession in the USA after extremely poor job data, which spooked market sentiment.\"\n\n\"The rally in the global stock markets has been driven mainly by consensus expectations of a soft landing for the US economy.

UK banks were among the biggest losers on the index, with shares in Barclays, Natwest and Lloyds falling as much as 5.2 per cent, 4.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.\n\nIn other parts of Europe, France's CAC 40 fell 3.1 per cent, while Germany's Dax declined 2.9 per cent.

The Nikkei 225 suffered its biggest one-day points fall, plunging more than 4,450 points and passing the 3,836 lost on \"Black Monday\" in October 1987.\n\nEuropean shares tumbled to a near six-month low with the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 shedding 3 per cent and set for its worst day in two and a half years. All major European bourses opened in the red. In Dublin, the Euronext was trading 1.5 per cent lower in early trade.\n\nFinancial sectors were hit the most on the day. Banks lost 4.2 per cent, financials services shed 3.6 per cent while and the tech sector slipped 5 per cent.\n\nFutures markets indicated the momentum was likely to extend to the US. Contracts tracking the Nasdaq 100 were trading down 5 per cent while the S&P 500 was expected to open 2.9 per cent lower.\n\nThe declines come amid fears that the Federal Reserve has been too slow to respond to signs the US economy is weakening, and may be forced to play catch up cut with a series of rapid interest rate cuts. Investor concerns over the health of the world's biggest economy and the rising tensions between Israel and Iran have piled further pressure on a market already buckling under an investor exodus from high-flying technology stocks.\n\n\"I'm not expecting a bounce for a little while, because right now we have this perfect storm of the Japanese carry trade being unwound, weakness in US Big Tech and Middle East tensions,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.\n\nFutures on the Vix index of expected US stock market turbulence - commonly known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" - climbed above 40 points on Monday, the highest since the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTraders in Tokyo said the selling was part of a big correction and de-risking move by global funds. But Tokyo equities were also hit by a yen that has strengthened by about 12 per cent since mid-July. On Monday, the yen soared 2.2 per cent to \u00a5142.3 against the dollar.\n\n\"The Japanese market is seen by global investors as a warrant on global trade,\" said the Japan head of one global pension fund. \"So if you are in severe de-risking mode, as a lot of investors are at this point because of US recession fears and geopolitics, it makes sense you take profits in a Japanese market that has done very well so far this year.\"\n\nTrading in both Topix and Nikkei futures were suspended during the afternoon session as the selling frenzy continued into the close, hitting \"circuit breaker\" levels that automatically stop trading. In Korea, similar circuit breakers were triggered for the first time in four years. Traders in Tokyo at three different brokerages said that they knew of several big hedge fund clients that had been ordered to close all their positions as losses mounted.\n\nThe sell-off in Japan was echoed across other Asian markets. South Korea's Kospi benchmark closed down 9.1 per cent while the Australian S&P/ASX finished 3.7 per cent lower. India's Sensex lost 2.9 per cent.\n\nThe global turbulence extended to the crypto market, with the price of bitcoin falling more than 17 per cent to $52,000 on Monday, while the price of ether, another cryptocurrency, has fallen almost 17 per cent to $2,200.\n\nThe Fed kept rates on hold when it met last week, but market reaction after the jobs data indicates that investors believe the central bank may have made a mistake in not cutting rates. JPMorgan economists joined the growing chorus of Wall Street strategists over the weekend calling for the Fed to reduce rates by 0.5 percentage points at its next two meetings.\n\nInvestors are betting the Fed will lower borrowing costs by more than a full percentage point by the end of the year to counter a weakening economy.\n\nDiana Iovanel, senior markets economist at Capital Economics in London, said equity \"valuations are still far from pointing to an economic cataclysm\".\n\nShe added: \"Renewed fears of a US recession have increased the chances of additional rate cuts from the Fed. But we don't think that the US economy will stand in the way of an equity rally for much longer.\" - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType":

the bourse operator issued a sidecar order, halting programme trading for five minutes, after the KOSPI 200 index fell over 5 per cent for more than one minute, reports Yonhap news agency.\n\nUS stocks fell for the second consecutive session Friday last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding 1.51 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 2.43 per cent.\n\nA disappointing jobs report spurred investor fears that the world's largest economy is headed toward a recession.\n\nIn Seoul, most shares traded negative across the board.\n\nTech shares were among the biggest losers, with major chipmaker SK hynix slumping 5.6 per cent and flat screen manufacturer LG Display declining 5.77 per cent.\n\nTop oil refinery SK Innovation fell 4.12 per cent, and major

for recession triggers global stock market plunge", "body": "Stock markets around the globe have continued to plunge on Monday amid fears the US economy may be on track for a recession as Japan suffered its worst sell-off since 'Black Monday' in 1987.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo crashed by 12 per cent this morning, the biggest single-day fall in almost four decades, while South Korea's Kospi fell by nine per cent.\n\nMarkets in London, France, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines also fell by around two-and-three percent which prompted the triggering of circuit breakers - where the trading of stocks is paused for 20 minutes.\n\nIt comes after the US Federal reserve on Wednesday decided not to slash interest rates from the 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent range which they have been frozen since July last year.\n\nInvestors have shared concerns that the Federal Reserve may have left it too late to support the fragile US economy, warning that a US recession would cause chaos within other economies around the globe.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index suffered its largest points drop in history, plunging 12.40%, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 as the broader Topix index lost 12.23%, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15\n\nExperts at investment bank Goldman Sachs said they now believed there was a staggering 25 per cent chance of a recession in the US - up ten percent from their previous estimate of 15 per cent, while JP Morgan put the chances of a recession at 50 per cent.\n\nTo help save the economy, experts say the Federal Reserve must cut interest rates much more quickly than planned to avoid a huge recession.\n\nA rate cut would make it easier for US households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs' economists, led by Jan Hatzius, said that 'we continue to see recession risk as limited' because there are no major financial imbalances.\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Bloodbath strikes Australia's sharemarket\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 plunged 12.40 per cent, or 4,451.28 points, to 31,458.42 - its biggest fall since 'Black Monday' in October 1986.\n\nThe broader Topix index lost 12.23 per cent, or 310.45 points, to 2,227.15.\n\nBy the close on Monday, the index had wiped out 113 trillion yen ($792.32 billion) of the Nikkei market value since July 11, when it peaked at 42,426.77 - a drop of 27 per cent.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki declared today the government was cooperating with the central bank and closely monitoring markets with a sense of urgency.\n\n'It's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks,' Suzuki told reporters, adding that authorities were watching stock market moves with 'grave concern'.\n\nThe sell-off followed the release of a dismal unemployment report last week.\n\nEmployers added just 114,000 jobs last month, according to Labor Department data released Friday, far below the Dow Jones estimate of 185,000.\n\nThe figure was the weakest since December last year and the second weakest since the start of the Covid pandemic in March 2020.\n\nRobert Carnell, from financial services firm ING, said: 'What we are looking at now is a situation where the market is viewing what's going on in the US macro economy as ticking the recession box.'\n\nThe unemployment rate also edged higher to 4.3 percent - the highest level since October 2021.\n\nJob growth in the US badly missed expectations in July and the unemployment rate jumped to the highest rate in almost three years\n\nMohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on Sunday he fears the economy may be spiraling due to the Fed keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high since in its zeal to stifle inflation.\n\nThose hikes are now hitting the economy hard, he said, suggesting the Fed should have lowered rates earlier.\n\n'I really do worry that we may lose US economic exceptionalism because of a policy mistake,' he told Bloomberg TV, as worldwide markets continued to plummet.\n\nJim Reid, global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank, said there had been 'astonishing moves' in share prices, and 'markets are melting down in Asia'.\n\n'Markets were on edge before Friday but a weak payrolls has really escalated a profound move across the globe,' he said.\n\n'It's like the market has added up 2+2 and made 9,' he added.\n\nInvestors will get a read on employment in the service sector from the ISM non-manufacturing survey due later Monday and analysts are hoping for a rebound to 51.0 after June's unexpected slide to 48.8.\n\nRead More Top economist issues dire warning about the US economy as he tears into the Fed\n\nThe huge drop in Treasury yields had also overshadowed the US dollar's usual safe-haven appeal and dragged the currency down around one per cent on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.5 per cent to 16,519.78 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.8 per cent to 7,637.40.\n\nThe latest setback has been particularly damaging for markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, Samsung's shares sank 11.6 per cent.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4 per cent as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8 per cent.\n\nAs the markets opened in Asia and Australia early Monday, NASDAQ futures dropped 2.27 percent, while S&P 500 futures dropped 1.41 percent.\n\nEarly on Monday, the euro was holding steady at $1.0907.\n\nThe Swiss franc was a major beneficiary of the rush from risk, with the dollar near six-month lows at 0.8586 francs .\n\n'The shift in expected interest rate differentials against the US has outweighed the deterioration in risk sentiment,' said Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\n\n'If the recession narrative takes hold in earnest, we would expect that to change, and the dollar to rebound as safe-haven demand becomes the dominant driver in currency markets.'\n\nInvestors had also increased wagers other major central banks would follow the Fed's lead and ease more aggressively, with the European Central Bank now seen cutting by 67 basis points by Christmas.\n\nIn commodity markets, gold was steady at $2,442 an ounce, supported by lower yields globally.\n\nOil prices bounced amid concerns about a widening conflict in the Middle East, though worries about demand had seen it sink to eight-month lows last week.\n\nBrent gained 44 cents to $77.24 a barrel, while US crude rose 40 cents to $73.92 per barrel.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

The world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin went down almost 14 per cent to $54,155.\n\nYeap Jun Rong of IG said that investors will be watching for data on the services sector from the US Institute for Supply Management.\n\nAbhishek Banerjee, smallcase Manager and Founder at Lotusdew, said that bad job reports and impending conflict in the Middle East are all contributing to risk off today.\n\n\"However, indicators like oil price volatility, US yields and unfilled positions indicate the opposite. I think today is one of the buy-on-dip days for a long-term investor,\" he added.\n\nSantosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart said that the global market is reeling as bears enter with a cocktail of bad news.\n\n\"The fear of a reverse Yen carry trade, following an interest rate hike in Japan, was the initial catalyst. This was compounded by fears of a recession in the USA after extremely poor job data, which spooked market sentiment,\" he added.\n\nThe rally in the global stock markets has been driven mainly by consensus expectations of a soft landing for the US economy.\n\nThis expectation is now under threat with the fall in the US job creation in July and the sharp rise in the US unemployment rate to 4.3 per cent, said experts.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc",

We explain.\n\nMarket rout: Japan's Nikkei index suffered its biggest loss in decades as global markets plunge\n\nWhat's happened to global stock markets?\n\nGlobal stocks are on shaky ground as indices suffered huge losses when markets opened on Monday morning.\n\nJapan's Nikkei closed 12.4 per cent lower, while its Topix index lost 2.48 per cent. The steep sell-off triggered circuit breakers which halted trade on stock exchanges across Asia.\n\nEuropean stocks also tumbled with France's CAC currently down 1.9 per cent, Spain's Ibex down 2.52 per cent.\n\nAt 11.40am, the UK's FTSE 100 was down 2.3 per cent, at 7,984 while the FTSE 250 was down 3.2 per cent at 20,826. The broader FTSE All Share was down 2.5 per cent.\n\nIt comes after US stocks declined on Friday while US Treasury yields fell below 4 per cent for the first time in six months. The S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent on Friday, while the tech-focussed Nasdaq fell 2.8 per cent and after a recent 10 per cent decline is in correction territory.\n\nDIY investment platform Robinhood halted 24 hour trading for its customers in the face of increased volatility.\n\nSnapshot: The UK's main markets were a sea of red on Monday morning\n\nWhy have global markets plunged?\n\nThe pullback in stocks comes hot off the disappointing US jobs data on Friday, sparking fears that the US economy could fall into a recession rather than achieve the soft landing investors have been banking on.\n\nEmployment data showed that the unemployment rate ticked higher, while employers added far fewer jobs than expected.\n\nAt the same time, the Federal Reserve voted to hold rates last week while other central banks, like the Bank of England, cut interest rates.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts increased the chances of a recession from 15 to 25 per cent in a note to investors.\n\nInvestors are worried that US inflation has proved stickier than anticipated and the Fed more reluctant to cut rates than expected. Signs that the US economy is slowing, which has not been priced in, then spooked markets.\n\nAJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould says that many equity markets have priced in inflation cooling and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe said: 'Any deviation from that path could therefore lead to trouble - either stickier inflation, economic and earnings disappointment of slower-than-expected rate cuts.\n\n'If anything markets were more concerned about it overheating earlier this year,' says Mould. 'Those with long memories will remember how frantic rate cuts in 2000-02 and 2007-8 failed to stave off a bear market in stocks'.\n\nThe US stock market's increasing concentration in the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies, who have largely seen their share prices soar on the back of high expectations for artificial intelligence, has exacerbated volatility.\n\nElsewhere, the sell off in Asia came as the Japanese yen strengthened against the US dollar, making goods more expensive and therefore less attractive for overseas investors.\n\nA lot of the market volatility has been influenced by the carry trade, where investors borrow in low-yield currencies to invest in higher-yield ones.\n\nThe yen has been particularly popular for this as a major source of global liquidity, so the Bank of Japan's decision to increase rates to 0.25 per cent, their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, has spurred volatility.\n\n'The yen is rallying, as massive short positions against it are closed out, to drive the currency higher still and force yet more liquidation by the shorts, to create a circle every bit as vicious as it had previously been virtuous,' says Mould.\n\nWhat does this mean for interest rates?\n\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates last week but the US Federal Reserve is the kepy player in global markets and it has so far held firm.\n\nCentral banks adjust interest rates to control inflation and support the economy and should not be influenced by shares falling, but the Fed will be keeping an eye on markets.\n\nGoldman Sachs now expect rate cuts in September, November and December. It said: 'The premise of our forecast is that job growth will recover in August and the FOMC will judge 25 bp cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks.\n\n'If we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50bp cut would be likely in September.'\n\nJP Morgan is pricing in a 50 per cent probability of a US recession and expects a 50 basis point cut in September, and another in November.\n\nWhat's happening to UK markets?\n\nMarkets in London haven't escaped the sell off, with both the FTSE 100 tumbling from near record high territory early last week to below 8,000.\n\nDanni Hewson, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis said: 'For the more domestically focussed FTSE 250 the whisper of US recession fears has bumped up against concern about the level of violence that's been seen in some UK towns and cities over the weekend.\n\n'Horrendous scenes of hotels on fire and streets littered with debris are likely to impact consumer confidence and footfall levels, which are crucial to retailers and hospitality venues.\n\n'Then there's the potential insurance claims stemming from the damage inflicted by flying bricks and Molotov cocktails.\n\n'For a UK economy struggling to find growth this chapter, particularly at this time, is a massively unwelcome one.'\n\nWhat should investors do?\n\nThe most important piece of advice to investors when markets sell off is not to panic. Invariably, by the time investors know the market is tanking, it is already too late to avoid the slump.\n\nWhile markets are understandably spooked, analysts have issued words of caution to investors looking to sell on the back of the US jobs report.\n\nSam North, market analyst at eToro, says that while markets have reacted badly to the lack of a rate cut and the jobs data, they had been riding high and this is likely to be a blip.\n\nHe said: 'Trends are more important than single reports. The unemployment rise was mainly due to temporary layoffs from Hurricane Beryl, which should reverse next month. Even if the jobs report signals bigger issues, the Fed has tools to respond.\n\n'Solid earnings growth is another reason to not panic. With most of the S&P 500 reporting, earnings are up 11.5 per cent annually, the fastest since late 2021, and revenues have grown for 15 quarters straight.\n\n'Strong economic growth also supports optimism. US GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in the second quarter, continuing a trend of over 2 per cent growth in seven of the last eight quarters.'\n\nWhat to do when markets fall\n\nSharp falls in the worry investors but corrections are natural for markets, which don't rise in a straight line, writes Simon Lambert.\n\nSome of the biggest falls in history fade into relative insignificance when you look at long-term stock market charts.\n\nThe most important thing for investors to do is to avoid panic moves, which can lead to selling out at a low and missing out on a rebound.\n\nHere are three tips for investors looking to calm their nerves.\n\nDo nothing: Not reacting to market sell-offs is usually the best course of action you can take. Studies repeatedly show that individual investors manage to underperform stock markets, as they tend to react badly and sell out when stocks are low and buy when they are high.\n\nDon't constantly check: Investing is for the long-term, so checking stocks and shares values on a daily basis is a recipe for trouble. If you do check your portfolio and feel compelled to act, don't do so immediately. Take a step back, discuss what you are thinking of doing with someone, or write it down - evaluate it carefully and consider is it the right move.\n\nAcknowledge your emotions: Greed and fear are the emotions that trigger rash investing behaviour, but it is only natural to feel them. Accept that your feelings when you see markets slump - or soar - are part and parcel of being human but remember that you can control whethe you react.\n\nTo sleep easier at night as an investor, consider these five things:\n\n1. Don't put all your eggs in one basket: A diversified portfolio can protect you when market storms arrive - don't be over-exposed to one stock, fund, sector or market.\n\n2. Harness the power of dividends: A large part of the long-term returns from stock market investing comes from reinvesting dividends and letting growth compound over time.\n\n3. Be brave when others are fearful: Treat market falls as an opportunity to buy investments at a lower prices. Think of it as the stock market being on sale rather than your investments being in a slump.\n\n4. Keep saving regularly: Regular monthly investing allows you to slowly and steadily build up your portfolio and avoid sudden lurches in the market that can affect lump sums put in just before a slump.\n\n5. Don't stop: Studies show that the longer you invest for the lower your chance of losing money over any given time period. Don't give up and pull your money out. And if you rely on your investments for income, avoid taking out large sums when markets are down.\n\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMSAJ BellAJ BellEasy investing and ready-made portfoliosLearn MoreLearn MoreHargreaves LansdownHargreaves LansdownFree fund dealing and investment ideasLearn MoreLearn Moreinteractive investorinteractive investorFlat-fee investing from \u00a34.99 per monthLearn MoreLearn MoreSaxoSaxoGet \u00a3200 back in trading feesLearn MoreLearn MoreTrading 212Trading 212Free dealing and no account feeLearn MoreLearn More\n\nAffiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

It also suffered its biggest-ever points loss, shedding 4,451.28.\n\nSeoul and Taipei plunged more than eight per cent each, while Singapore gave up nearly five per cent and Sydney more than three per cent.\n\nFutures trading was temporarily suspended on the Nikkei and Topix indexes, on the Osaka Exchange and in Seoul in a bid to ease volatility.\n\nHong Kong and Shanghai dropped, with traders brushing off a set of directives released by China aimed at boosting household consumption in the world's number two economy.\n\nThere were also big losses in Mumbai, Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta and Wellington.\n\nLondon and Paris were down more than 2 per cent at the open while Frankfurt was down more than 3 per cent.\n\nThe biggest losers were tech firms, with chip titan TSMC losing nearly 10 per cent in Taipei, while Seoul-listed Samsung and SK Hynix were each down more than 11 per cent. Tokyo Electron nosedived 18.48 per cent in Japan.\n\nBut the pain was not reserved only for the tech sector, with Toyota shedding 13.65 per cent and HSBC off more than five per cent.\n\nMarkets are \"still reeling from last Friday's seismic shifts in the global financial landscape.\n\n\"The trigger? A US employment report that missed the mark so badly didn't just drop jaws -- it dropped stocks and bond yields while sending volatility and rate cut expectations through the roof,\" said Stephen Innes in his Dark Side Of The Boom newsletter.\n\nHe pointed out that \"the mood was already souring in Asia\" following a disappointing batch of earnings from tech titans such as Tesla and Alphabet as well as a rate hike by the Bank of Japan and more weak Chinese economic data.\n\n\"Mix these, and you have the perfect market meltdown recipe,\" he said.\n\nThe selling was also making officials in Tokyo sit up after the Nikkei shed 5.8 per cent on Friday.\n\nJapan's top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said it \"would continue to stay on its toes and monitor market developments with keen interest.\n\n\"We are aware there are various evaluations regarding the stocks plunge this time around, and about the status of the Japanese economy, but the government will continue its efforts to completely break free of deflation and to transition to a growth-driven economy.\"\n\nThe yen broke through 143 per dollar for the first time since January as the jobs report ramped up expectations the Fed will slash rates.\n\nThe US central bank had signalled after its latest meeting Wednesday that slowing inflation and a softening labour market meant it could cut next month, with traders predicting two or three 25-basis-point reductions before January.\n\nNow there is speculation it will lower rates by a full percentage point in that time.\n\nTaylor Nugent at the National Australia Bank said, \"The Fed doesn't meet again until September 18. There is one more payroll report and two (consumer price indexes) before then.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine they could stop the Fed cutting in September, with interest instead on whether they support a 50-basis-point move and how rapid cuts will be going forward.\"\n\nThe yen -- which just last month hit a nearly four-decade low close to 162 to the dollar -- was also boosted by the Bank of Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates for just the second time in 17 years and its suggestion more could be on the way.\n\nNozomi Moriya at UBS forecast the yen to end the year around 145 to the dollar and drop to around 130 in 2025.\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 2.2 per cent per cent at 16,576.84\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.0 per cent at $72.80 per barrel", "source": {"uri":

investments.\n\nBut drops in performance of investments do happen from time to time, and over longer periods, tend to iron themselves out.\n\nIt's too early at the moment to determine how serious Monday's figures are for investors.\n\nA US recession is likely to impact efforts to fuel growth in Britain.\n\nCostas Milas, economist at Liverpool University, said research suggested weak US growth will hit the UK's economy making it a less attractive place to invest.\n\n\"This should be a worry both for Rachel Reeves and [Bank of England Governor] Andrew Bailey: inbound FDI (foreign direct investment) to the UK has been consistently dropping after Brexit which explains, partly our poor productivity performance (since higher FDI flows raise domestic productivity) and therefore undermines

Kleinhenz shared his insights in the August issue of NRF's Monthly Economic Review.\n\n\"The consumer environment has kept the expansion on a positive path toward a 'soft landing' despite high interest rates,\" said Kleinhenz. \"Meanwhile, inflation has not yet been fully tamed, but we are seeing progress.\"\n\nYear-over-year (YoY) gross domestic product (GDP) growth rebounded to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, doubling the 1.4 per cent growth observed in the first quarter. This results in an average growth rate of 2.1 per cent for the first half of the year. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, which is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, showed a YoY inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in the second quarter, down from 3.4 per cent in the first quarter. This rate remains above the Fed's target of 2 per cent. Retail goods prices remained near zero, as per NRF.\n\nJob growth has been inconsistent but has clearly moderated, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on track to begin cutting interest rates later this year. The three-month average for payroll gains slowed to 177,000 jobs in June from 267,000 in March, indicating a cooling but still growing economy. Additionally, hiring decreased from 5.7 million jobs in May to 5.3 million in June, with job openings falling slightly from 8.23 million to 8.18 million in the same period.\n\nRetail sales data from the Census Bureau revealed a resilient US consumer base willing to spend despite ongoing cost pressures during the second quarter. Total retail sales increased by 2.5 per cent YoY in the second quarter and by 2.8 per cent for the first half of the year. Core retail sales, as defined by NRF to exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations, and restaurants, rose by 3.2 per cent YoY for the first six months. This aligns with NRF's forecast for 2024 core retail sales growth of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent over 2023.\n\nDespite the economy's strength in the first half of 2024, consumer confidence remains weak. The University of Michigan's monthly consumer sentiment survey fell for the fourth consecutive month, dropping to 66 in July from a recent high of 79 in March.\n\nNevertheless, consumers' ability and willingness to spend has been supported by job and wage gains, with disposable income up 3.6 per cent YoY in the second quarter. A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey indicates that consumers expect inflation to gradually decrease over the next few years, from 3 per cent a year from now to 2.9 per cent in three years and 2.8 per cent in five years.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged this week, but Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that a rate cut 'could be on the table' in September.", "source": {"uri": "fibre2fashion.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fibre2fashion.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Retail_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Retail Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disposable and discretionary income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Employment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.fibre2fashion.com/Newsresource/images/297/adobestock-882691050_308742.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790581", "eventUri": "eng-9790581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

7:30PMCommentsCommentsEmail Neale Prior\n\nAustralian superannuation accounts are set to tumble as share markets plunge amid growing recession fears in the US and Japan.\n\nMore than $100 billion was wiped off the value of Australian shares in the Monday rout, taking total losses to upwards of $160 billion over two days as markets plunged globally.\n\nTokyo's stock exchange plunged more than 14 per cent on Monday and Australia's market finished almost 4 per cent down as shares endured some of their worst days since the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.\n\nSuper funds directly or indirectly own about a quarter of the shares and trusts traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.\n\nAnd with more than 60 per cent of retirement savings exposed to Australian and overseas shares, fund managers fear the US and Japan market plunges will create a global bear market.\n\nWorries have been aggravated by tumbles in speculation-driven technology plays and American consumer spending stocks after the US Federal Reserve decided last Wednesday not to cut official interest rates.\n\nTalks of a manufacturing slowdown in the US, rising unemployment and a disappointing update from online retail giant Amazon further sapped confidence on Wall Street.\n\nThe tech-heavy NASDAQ index slipped more than 5.5 per cent in the last two trading days of last week, officially taking it into a correction, given it has now fallen more than 10 per cent since hitting a record high on July 10.\n\nAustralian shares have lost an average of 5.8 per cent of their value in two rugged trading days on the ASX.\n\nBut all this was eclipsed by a 19 per cent plunge in Tokyo over three days amid fears Japanese central banks could lift interest rates to fight inflation -- and potentially drive the economy back into recession.\n\nThe fate of share markets is central to the retirement savings of millions of Australians given the heavy reliance on shares -- which have starred in the 15 years since governments borrowed economies out of the global financial crisis.\n\nAt last official count at the end of March, almost 31 per cent of the $2.55 trillion held by Australia's industry, corporate, retail and public sector super funds was invested in international share markets.\n\nAbout 27 per cent of these retirement savings -- or $688 billion -- was recorded as being held by Australian companies, property trusts and infrastructure plays traded on the stock exchange.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au",

What was the aftermath?\n\nAccording to Federal Reserve History, it all began with stock markets in and around Asia plunging.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei lost 14.9 per cent or 3,836 points, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index's RSI crashed 40 per cent.\n\nThen, the US markets opened to utter chaos.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 22.6 per cent in a single trading session, while the S&P 500 plunged 30 per cent.\n\nIt was the biggest US stock market loss since the Great Depression.\n\n\"People were coming out for their smoking breaks and they looked shell-shocked, _NPR'_s former economic correspondent Barbara Mantel reported. \"They were using words like hysteria, panic to describe what was going on inside.\"\n\nThe contagion then spread to Europe.\n\nIn the UK, the London stock market fell by 22 per cent over two days.\n\nOf all the markets that were in the red, Austria was the least affected at a loss of 11.4 per cent.\n\nInterestingly, the Sensex, which had only launched in 1986, actually closed higher.\n\nAround 1.71 trillion is thought to have been wiped out across the world.\n\nThe events of Black Monday shook up investors and raised the spectre of a repeat of the Great Depression.\n\nInstead, several events occurred that created a perfect storm for investors.\n\nAs per Federal Reserve History, the federal government unveiled a bigger trade deficit than expected. The dollar also fell in value.\n\nExperts also think that the markets, which had been on a major bull run since 1982, were ripe for correction.\n\nComputerised trading, also known as program trading, is also thought to have played a part. Portfolio insurance - which short-sells index futures to keep potential stock losses in check - is thought to have been a key factor in the new-fangled computerised trading. The computer programs essentially began selling stocks - thus creating a domino effect.\n\nMeanwhile, the Friday before the crash also saw 'triple witching' - when stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options contracts expired simultaneously.\n\nThis, naturally, caused major instability in the final few hours of Friday trading and later spilled over to Monday.\n\nFinally, experts blame mass hysteria - essentially a herd mentality taking over among investors - for the major decline.\n\n\"There is so much psychological togetherness that seems to have worked both on the up side and on the down side,\" Andrew Grove, chief executive of technology company Intel Corp was quoted as saying by the website.\n\n\"It's a little like a theatre where someone yells 'Fire!'\n\nThe aftermath\n\nUS Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said, \"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the Nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.\"\n\nAs per Investopedia, the US Federal Reserve acted immediately by cutting interest rates half a percentage point.\n\nThis, it hoped, would encourage liquidity in the market. It also funnelled billions of dollars into the economy through quantitative easing - buying bonds to push up their prices and bring down interest rates.\n\nRegulators also introduced circuit-breakers for the first time to prevent crashes through computerised trading.\n\nThese would immediately halt trading in case of unusual drops or rises on stock exchanges.\n\nFor example, the New York Stock Exchange now temporarily halts trading when the S&P 500 stock index declines 7 percent, 13 percent, and 20 percent.\n\nAs its website explains, \"In response to the market breaks in October 1987 and October 1989, the New York Stock Exchange instituted circuit breakers to reduce volatility and promote investor confidence. By implementing a pause in trading, investors are given time to assimilate incoming information and the ability to make informed choices during periods of high market volatility.\"\n\nDiana B Henriques, author of A First-Class Catastrophe: The Road to Black Monday, the Worst Day in Wall Street History summed up the aftermath of the day to _NPR, \"_It wasn't like any previous market crash and yet, every crash since has been similar to 1987.\"\n\n\"Not only was Black Monday worse than we remember today; it was worse than we knew at the time,\" Henriques added. \"Some events are important because of what they reveal, what they show us about the world we're living in. And that was what made the 1987 crash so important.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sign up to receive it straight to your inbox here.\n\nBy Sarah Vizard\n\nMany of us may have been distracted by a brilliant weekend of sport in which we witnessed the closest men's 100-metre race in history, a first-ever Olympic medal in the women's 100 metres for St Lucia and an epic battle between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz for gold in the men's tennis.\n\nBut for many that distraction won't have lasted long this morning. Global stock markets have fallen sharply today, with investors rattled by concerns of a US recession and a worsening situation in the Middle East.\n\nJapan's benchmark stock index the Nikkei 225 fell by 13 per cent - its worst performance since \"Black Monday\" 37 years ago and wiping out all its gains this year. This was echoed in other Asian markets, with South Korea's Kopsi dropping by 9 per cent, while stock markets in India, Hong Kong, China and Australia also fell.\n\nIn the UK, the FTSE 100 fell by 2 per cent and is having its worst day in more than a year. Nearly all the companies on the index dropped as markets opened, with just five higher in early trading. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 shed 3 per cent of its value.\n\nThere are indications that stocks in the US will follow suit when markets open there. The S&P 500 is expected to open around 2.9 per cent lower, while contracts tracking the Nasdaq 100 are trading down 5 per cent, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThat follows losses for Wall Street on Friday, when tech firms were particularly hit as investors pulled back from a rally fuelled by optimism over AI. Amazon shares fell by more than 9 per cent on the back of weaker-than-expected revenues, one of the biggest one-day falls for the company in recent history. But it was worse for Intel, which dropped by more than a quarter, its biggest one-day fall since 1982, seemingly prompting this tweet from its CEO:\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has more than halved its stake in Apple, despite the company posting record quarterly operating profit. Berkshire sold roughly 390 million Apple shares in the second quarter and 115 million in the first as part of a broader move away from stock and towards cash that suggests Buffett is wary about the state of the US economy and the price of stock market valuations. Apple shares are forecast to open about 9 per cent down when trading begins in New York this afternoon. That would be equivalent to $30bn (\u00a324bn) being wiped off the value of the company.\n\nWhile the AI pullback is one explanation for the slump, there are wider issues at play. Rising tensions in the Middle East have investors worried, as have signs of a weakening economy in the US. Just 114,000 new jobs were added in the US last month, lower than expected and well down from June, while the unemployment rate hit its highest level since October 2021.\n\nThe economic turbulence is also impacting M&A. Sidara, a Dubai-based company, has decided not to buy British engineering group John Wood, citing rising geopolitical risks and financial market uncertainty. The Middle East is a key area of growth for John Wood, accounting for around 18 per cent of its business. Shares in the firm fell by 40 per cent on the news.\n\nWhile stock markets are falling, analysts seem less concerned. Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients seen by Bloomberg News that it believes the chances of a US recession have risen from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, although it caveats that it sees the risk as \"limited\".\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Reid, global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank, called the moves \"astonishing\" and \"profound\" but added: \"It's like the market has added up two plus two and made nine.\"\n\nNevertheless, it makes interest rate reductions more likely. The US central bank held rates at its meeting last week, but signalled cuts are likely in the coming months. Finding the right balance to get economies moving again is proving tricky.\n\nBy Graham Ruddick\n\n1. Intel is in danger of becoming a new case study about how a great business can unravel. Shares in the company have fallen by more than 50 per cent in 2024 and there could be worse to come. The chipmaker is under pressure from a string of nimble rivals such as TSMC, Nvidia and Arm, whose innovations have eroded Intel's market.

The study found that companies with poor management practices often operate in low-competition areas and are prevalent among family-owned businesses, particularly when control is overly concentrated within the family. Investment strategist Joachim Klement breaks it down.\n\n\ud83c\udf54 Why are there so many fast-food offers on?\n\nFast-food giants are intensifying their promotional offers as they compete to attract more thrifty customers. With the number of promotions rising by a third between April and June compared to the previous year, chains like McDonald's, KFC and Domino's are using deals to counteract declining foot traffic and rising costs. We may be watching a pivot masterclass that growing businesses can learn from.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 How I turned LADbible into a \u00a3260m media empire\n\nThe Sunday Times has spoken to Alexander \"Solly\" Solomou, the 33-year-old CEO of LBG Media, about how he transformed LADbible from a controversial Facebook page into a \u00a3260m business with 500 employees across Manchester, London and New York.

Launched in 1977, just weeks after Voyager 1, it is now 15.2 billion miles away and getting 10 miles further away every second.\n\nTheir initial mission was to tour the giant outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, photographing them and collecting data. But when that tour was finished, they just kept going.\n\nIn case they are ever found by another lifeform, each has an aluminium phonograph record that contains images of our DNA, greetings in 55 languages, the sounds of animals and machines, and the music of Beethoven, Louis Armstrong and Blind Willie Johnson.\n\nBut Voyager 1 has now broken. And nobody can remember how to fix it. This fascinating deep dive from the Financial Times tells the story of the spacecraft and how engineers and scientists have worked together to try to remember how to fix it, digging through archives and coming up with new solutions.\n\nYou can read it here.", "source": {"uri": "businessleader.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri":

 --  'structural reforms essential'", "body": "The Cypriot economy continues to display remarkable growth and resilience in the face of a challenging global economic environment, Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) governor Christodoulos Patsalides said on Monday.\n\nPatsalides' comments were delivered in his introduction to the CBC's economic bulletin for June 2024, where he highlighted the positive economic indicators that underscore Cyprus' robust economic performance.\n\nIn the bulletin, Patsalides noted that the growth rate in the first quarter of 2024 exceeded expectations, while unemployment dropped to 6 per cent, marking its lowest level since 2009.\n\n\"Domestic inflation decreased to 2.2 per cent in the first five months of the year, which is close to the ECB's medium-term target of 2 per cent, and a significant improvement compared to 5.4 per cent in the same period last year,\" he stated.\n\nMoreover, he mentioned that the fiscal surplus for 2023 recorded the highest performance since 2007, further solidifying the country's economic stability.\n\nThe CBC governor also pointed to recent upgrades in Cyprus' credit rating by various rating agencies as evidence of the economy's upward trajectory.\n\nThese agencies, Patsalides explained, \"highlighted the improvement in fiscal metrics, strong economic growth, and the resilience of the banking sector\".\n\nPatsalides added that \"the positive performance of the Cypriot economy has been acknowledged in recent reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission\".\n\nDiscussing domestic economic developments, Patsalides mentioned that Cyprus' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) saw an annual increase of 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, which was higher than originally expected.\n\n\"This growth reflects, among other factors, the gradual easing of the economic impact of ongoing sanctions against Russia and the limited effects of the Middle East conflict,\" he stated.\n\n\"The GDP growth for the whole of 2024 is expected to reach 3 per cent, compared to 2.5 per cent in 2023, driven primarily by investments and private consumption,\" Patsalides added.\n\nHe also pointed out that exports are expected to grow, albeit to a lesser extent than imports, due to the ongoing effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on professional services and the anticipated loss of Israeli tourists.\n\n\"However, these impacts are expected to subside in the medium term, supporting growth through the diversification of markets for tourism, financial, and professional services,\" he explained.\n\n\"Furthermore, the growth of foreign-interest technology companies established in Cyprus in recent years will continue to support GDP,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the CBC's forecasts for June 2024 predict GDP growth of 3.1 per cent in 2025 and 3.2 per cent in 2026.\n\n\"For the entire period of 2024-2026, the projected GDP growth is primarily based on domestic demand, which will be supported by the increase in households' real disposable income due to the expected decline in inflation, rising wages, and the resilience of the labour market,\" Patsalides said.\n\nSignificant contributions are also expected from major private investments and digital and green development projects, as well as reform projects under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.\n\nIn terms of inflation, Patsalides highlighted that the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Cyprus is expected to decrease to 2.1 per cent in 2024, down from 3.9 per cent in 2023.\n\nThis decline, he explained, reflects developments in energy prices, the ongoing restrictive impact of the ECB's monetary policy, and the easing of inflationary pressures from supply chain disruptions in previous years.\n\nFurthermore, inflation is projected to drop to 1.9 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026, thereby \"improving citizens' purchasing power and creating a more favourable environment for businesses and economic growth\".\n\nThe structural inflation rate is also expected to drop from 3.8 per cent in 2023 to 2.5 per cent in 2024, 2.1 per cent in 2025, and 2.0 per cent in 2026, mainly due to the continued dampening effect of the eurozone's monetary policy and the normalisation of external inflationary pressures.\n\nTurning to the banking sector, Patsalides reported that despite ongoing challenges, \"the Cypriot banking system continues to show positive progress, as reflected in key supervisory indicators\".\n\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2024 stood at 21.5 per cent, compared to the European ratio of 15.9 per cent in March of this year.\n\nAdditionally, the liquidity coverage ratio stood at 341 per cent in March, well above the minimum supervisory requirement.\n\n\"Non-performing loans (NPLs) continue to decline, with their share of the consolidated loan portfolio of banks at 7.3 per cent at the end of March 2024,\" Patsalides stated.\n\nThe banking sector's profitability has also increased due to rising interest rates, with significant contributions from the placement of excess liquidity in ECB deposits.\n\nSpecifically, the Cypriot banking system recorded profits of \u20ac345 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nHowever, Patsalides cautioned that despite this performance, there is no room for complacency, saying that \"the banking system faces an increased number of risks that require careful management\".\n\nThe CBC governor also said that \"geopolitical developments, climate change, and the critical yet unpredictable technology sector are key supervisory priorities in recent years, which banks need to address to maintain their strength, resilience, and competitiveness\".\n\n\"Strengthening corporate governance is a fundamental requirement for achieving these goals,\" he added.\n\nIn the context of the aforementioned information, Patsalides asserted that the \"Cypriot economy remains strong and competitive\".\n\nHe explained that this is \"thanks to the continuous upgrade of the services sector, the attraction of foreign investments, the support of small and medium-sized enterprises, prudent fiscal management, and the ongoing progress in the banking sector\".\n\n\"To ensure a stable and flexible growth path, it is essential to continue the structural reforms of the Recovery and Resilience Plan, which include the digitalisation of public administration, the improvement of the education system, and the promotion of green development,\" he added.\n\n\"These reforms will enhance competitiveness, create new jobs, and ensure sustainable growth for future generations,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType":

Selling spilled into European markets and was poised to reach Wall Street later in the day.\n\nIn short: recent economic data has punctured the widely held view that global policymakers, led by the US Federal Reserve, will be able to cool inflation without too much collateral damage.\n\nFriday's US jobs report, which showed a much sharper slowdown in hiring than Wall Street anticipated, added to simmering fears that the world's largest economy is coming under growing strains from high borrowing costs. Corporate executives signalled during the recent earnings season that consumers, who play a central role in the US economy, are beginning to cut back on spending.\n\n\"Entering this year, investor expectations were for a 'Goldilocks' outcome,\" JPMorgan equities strategists said on Monday, adding that this narrative was now being \"severely tested\".\n\nGoldman Sachs said at the weekend that it now believed there was a one-in-four chance of the US falling into recession in the next year, compared with its previous forecast of 15 per cent odds.\n\nSigns of impending economic malaise are not limited to the US: eurozone business surveys show the bloc has been hit by geopolitical tensions, weaker global growth and fragile consumer confidence. Activity in China's dominant factory sector also eased in the three months through to July.\n\nSurveys last month of executives in the manufacturing sector are \"consistent with a stall in global factory output gains\", said JPMorgan Chase global chief economist Bruce Kasman.\n\nJapan has further complicated the situation with a continued shift away from its negative-rate policies, which began in March and accelerated last week. This has caused tumult in the currency market that has spread elsewhere.\n\nGlobal equities markets had up until recently been on the rise, driven by hopes for a Goldilocks economic scenario and a rush into US tech stocks fuelled by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence technology. Wall Street's S&P 500, the world's most important equities barometer, rallied almost 20 per cent from the start of the year to a record closing high on July 16.\n\nPullbacks tend to be swifter than melt-ups: the S&P 500 has fallen almost 6 per cent since reaching its July peak and futures trading suggests the gauge will sustain a further decline on Monday.\n\nThe rise in equities this year also made stocks look more expensive, a factor that has been a consistent concern for investors. The S&P 500 was as of Friday trading at about 20.5 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, compared with an average since 2000 of 16.5, FactSet data shows.\n\nThe Vix index, often referred to as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\", has shot up to 50 points compared with 16 points a week ago, its highest level since the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and signalling that more tumult could be in store for markets.\n\nThe volatility also comes at the beginning of August, a time when senior investors and traders pack up for their summer holidays. Generally, this \"low liquidity\" situation lends itself to exacerbated moves.\n\nMany investors have been fretting about the outsized influence on markets of just a small handful of tech stocks -- America's Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia accounted for 52 per cent of the year-to-date returns on the S&P 500 through to the end of July, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. These stocks are now under pressure, with their once-positive influence on markets morphing into a pivotal factor in the sell-off. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down more than 10 per cent from its July peak.\n\nThe gloom was accentuated by news this weekend that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut its stake in Apple by half as part of a broader shift away from equities that led the billionaire investor to offload $76bn of stocks.\n\nOther tech-focused concerns have also surfaced. Intel, one of the US's best-known chipmakers, tumbled about 30 per cent last week after it unveiled plans to cut 15,000 jobs as part of a sweeping turnaround plan. Other chip stocks fell as a result.\n\nAnxiety that an AI boom would drive huge demand for specialised chips and servers is overdone has also weighed on sentiment.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia, which briefly became the world's most valuable company this year, has fallen 21 per cent from its June highs.\n\nJapan's equities have erased all of their gains for the year following Monday's plunge, stung by a rapid rise in the yen after the Bank of Japan last week hoisted its main interest rate to 0.25 per cent, the highest level since the global financial crisis in late 2008.\n\nThe more hawkish stance in Japan has contrasted with expectations for a dovish shift in US monetary policy. This has caused an unwinding of so-called \"carry trades\" in which investors borrow in a country with low rates to invest in one with high rates.\n\nThis interplay has sent the yen rallying more than 12 per cent against the US dollar -- a seismic move in currency markets -- since the end of June to \u00a5142.5. A stronger currency is a big headwind for the country's exporter-heavy stock benchmarks.\n\nJapan's actively traded stock market, which is heavily exposed to the global economy, is also an obvious place to start taking risk off the table when big global funds switch into panic mode.\n\nDespite recent bullish \"Japan is back\" rhetoric, and the all-time highs hit by Tokyo stocks in July, the story only ever had fragile support. Domestic institutions and individuals were never buying into the market with strong conviction, meaning that the heavy lifting of the recent rally was largely driven by foreigners.\n\nIt means these investment \"tourists\" can pull out of the market with extraordinary speed -- and they have done so.\n\nWhen the Fed held interest rates last week at a 23-year high above 5 per cent, the central bank was doing as investors expected.\n\nBut the weak July jobs report, which showed slower hiring and a rise in the unemployment rate, suddenly spread panic that the Fed might have left it too long to begin lowering borrowing costs, heightening the risks of a US recession. Fed chief Jay Powell may be put to the test if markets begin creaking over a sustained period.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in 1.25 percentage points of Fed cuts -- or five quarter-point reductions -- by the end of the year. Traders are also betting on the possibility the US central bank will be forced to react before its next meeting in September with an unscheduled emergency cut.\n\n\"We see a possibility of a [0.5 percentage point] cut in September but want confirmation from other data,\" said Steven Englander at Standard Chartered. \"If other data confirm that the decline is as steep as the July labour data suggest, a sequence of sharp cuts is likely.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 231961634, "title": "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says 274 Palestinians were killed in Israeli raid that rescued 4 hostages", "text": "By WAFAA SHURAFA and SAMY MAGDY (Associated Press) DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 At least 274 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more were wounded in the Israeli raid that rescued four hostages held by Hamas, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said Sunday. The military said its forces came under heavy fire during the complex daytime operation deep inside the territory. The killing of so many Palestinians, including women and children, in a raid that Israelis celebrated as a stunning success because all four hostages were rescued alive, showed the heavy cost of such operations on top of the already soaring toll of the 8-month-long war ignited by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack. Scores of hostages are believed to be held in densely populated areas or inside Hamas\u2019 labyrinth of tunnels, making rescue attempts extremely complex and risky. A similar raid in February rescued two hostages while leaving 74 Palestinians dead. The operation deep into Nuseirat, a built-up refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, was the largest rescue since Oct. 7, when Hamas and other militants stormed across the border, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Israel launched a massive offensive that has killed over 36,700 Palestinians, according to the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its counts. It said nearly 700 people were wounded in Saturday\u2019s raid. The ministry did not say how many of the casualties were women and children, but Associated Press reporters saw several being treated at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah in the aftermath of the raid. \u2018MY BROTHER DIED OF GRIEF\u2019 Israelis celebrated the return of Noa Argamani, 26; Almog Meir Jan, 22; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 41, after Israeli forces raided two locations at once while under fire. Argamani was one of the most widely recognized hostages after being taken, like the three others, from a music festival. The video of her abduction showed her seated between two men on a motorcycle as she screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d Her mother, Liora, who has brain cancer, had released a video pleading to see her daughter. Israel\u2019s Channel 13 said Argamani was moved to the hospital where her mother is treated. Meir Jan\u2019s aunt, Dina, said his father had died on Friday, hours before the operation. \u201cMy brother died of grief, and he didn\u2019t get to see Almog return,\u201d she told Israel\u2019s Kan public broadcaster. Dr. Itai Pessach, a physician at Sheba Hospital where the freed captives were being treated, said none had serious physical injuries but that it would likely be days before they could be discharged. \u201cA lot of them have lost friends and family. Things happened in these eight months that they weren\u2019t here. So (medical staff) have been assisting them in rebuilding the infrastructure of their life,\u201d he told reporters. SCENES OF HORROR AT GAZA HOSPITAL In Gaza, medics described scenes of chaos after Saturday\u2019s raid as wounded people overwhelmed hospitals that were already struggling to treat the wounded from days of heavy Israeli strikes in the area. \u201cWe had the gamut of war wounds, trauma wounds, from amputations to eviscerations to trauma, to TBIs (traumatic brain injuries), fractures, and obviously, big burns,\u201d said Karin Huster of Doctors Without Borders, an international charity working in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one of the facilities that received dead and wounded. \u201cKids completely grey or white from the shock, burnt, screaming for their parents. Many of them are not screaming because they are in shock.\u201d The Israeli military said it had attacked \u201cthreats to our forces in the area,\u201d and that a special forces officer was killed in the rescue operation. Israel\u2019s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told reporters Saturday that the hostages were being held in two apartments, about 200 meters (219 yards) away from each other, in the heart of the Nuseirat camp. He said the forces had trained repeatedly on a model of the apartment buildings. Hagari said the forces moved in simultaneously in broad daylight on both apartments, believing this ensured the best element of surprise. But he said the rescuers came under heavy fire as they moved out, including from gunmen firing rocket-propelled grenades from within the neighborhood. He said the military responded with heavy force, including from aircraft, to extract the rescuers and freed hostages. Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at critics of the operation in a post on X, saying \u201conly Israel\u2019s enemies complained about the casualties of Hamas terrorists and their accomplices.\u201d AROUND 120 HOSTAGES STILL MISSING Of the 250 hostages abducted on Oct. 7, about half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November. About 120 hostages remain, with 43 pronounced dead. Survivors include about 15 women, two children under 5 and two men in their 80s. Saturday\u2019s operation brought the total number of rescued hostages to seven, including one who was freed shortly after the October attack. Israeli troops have recovered the bodies of at least 16 others, according to the government. The latest rescue lifted some spirits in Israel as divisions deepened over the best way to bring hostages home. Many Israelis urge Netanyahu to embrace a cease-fire deal U.S. President Joe Biden announced last month, but far-right allies threaten to collapse his government if he does. Thousands of Israelis again gathered Saturday night to protest the government and call for a cease-fire agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return to the Middle East this week, seeking a breakthrough. International pressure is mounting on Israel to limit civilian bloodshed in its war in Gaza. Palestinians also face widespread hunger because fighting and Israeli restrictions have largely cut off the flow of aid. __ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "summary": "Israelis celebrated the return of Noa Argamani, 26; Almog Meir Jan, 22; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 41, after Israeli forces raided two locations at once while under fire.", "url": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/06/09/gazas-health-ministry-says-274-palestinians-were-killed-in-israeli-raid-that-rescued-4-hostages/", "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Israel_Palestinians_30922_5d4a34.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:07:39", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.206}

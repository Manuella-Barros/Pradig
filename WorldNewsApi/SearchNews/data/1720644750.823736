Mr. Gloria\u2019s proposals include a large-scale homeless shelter at a Middletown location, and a \u201csafe parking\u201d lot at a demolished navy barracks site, H Barracks, near the airport, where the press conference was held. The mayor said his \u201cProtecting our Progress\u201d budget \u201cincreases funding in order to continue getting people off the streets and into shelter and care.\u201d The council is scheduled to vote on the budget on June 11. The city is currently negotiating a lease for the homeless shelter with the owner of vacant commercial warehouse on the corner of Kettner Boulevard and Vine Street. The shelter is projected to hold roughly 1,000 people at a time and will be the largest shelter in the county. The H Barracks safe parking lot will provide 200 parking spaces for those who live in their vehicles. It is part of the city\u2019s Safe Parking Program, which currently operates 233 parking spaces. San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria holds a press conference at the H Barracks site, where a safe parking lot for homeless people is proposed. (Jane Yang/The Epoch Times) A recent state auditor\u2019s report found that California has failed to track the effectiveness of its billion-dollar spending on homeless programs.

(The Epoch Times) Inhumane and Expensive, say ProtestersAbout 50 feet from the press conference, outside the fenced off H Barracks site, 20 to 30 locals waved signs and chanted \u201cFree San Diego.\u201d Their signs read \u201cStop the Mega Homeless Shelter on Kettner & Vine\u201d and \u201cProtect Our Community.\u201d One of the protesters, Vanessa Andrew, called the shelter \u201cinhumane.\u201d \u201cThe plot of land cannot accommodate that many people,\u201d she said. Ms. Andrew said the location was dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s on a busy street adjacent to a freeway exit. According to [the San Diego Association of Governments], there are between 25,000 to 30,000 cars a day that pass by that building. People exit the freeway driving at 75 mph,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have homeless people who suffer from mental illness or drug addiction and are not in their proper state of mind, they are going to get hit by a car. \u201cThink about this: You are driving your kids to school and you get off the freeway and hit a homeless person. The people in that car will be traumatized for the rest of their lives, not to mention the person that\u2019s lost their life.\u201d Protesters stand outside the H Barracks site during the mayor's press conference. (Jane Yang/The Epoch Times) Several protesters expressed their dissatisfaction about not being allowed onto the premises for the press conference. Andrew Hollingworth of Point Loma said, \u201cThis is public property, the mayor prohibited the public from getting into his press conference. We\u2019ve asked him to engage with us on this project, he refuses to do so.\u201d Mr. Hollingworth believes the shelter could \u201cbreak the city [financially],\u201d according to an analysis done by ProtectPointLoma.org. \u201cIt will cost the city $2 billion.\u201d Patty Ducey-Brooks echoed those sentiments: \u201cI\u2019m representing Old Town, Mission Hills and the surrounding communities. Our elected officials are making very expensive decisions behind closed doors at the cost of the taxpayers, and we are fed up.\u201d San Diego mayoral candidate Larry Turner was among the protesters. He said Mr. Gloria\u2019s handling of homeless issues follows Sacramento\u2019s \u201cdogmatic approach of housing first. \u2026 But you can\u2019t give keys to a person who is living with addictions and problems that got them on the streets \u2026 and expect their lives will be magically changed.\u201d\u2018Just Doing What We Can\u2019A homeless person named Scott set up his tent just outside the fence, tucked behind a short bush. He said he has been homeless for 16 years, since his veteran father passed away. Scott said he wouldn\u2019t live in the shelter. \u201cEverybody has their own problems. It\u2019s either drugs or disagreeing with other people. \u2026 When you get a lot of people in one spot, you will have a lot of fights, disagreements, and it can cause a lot of problems.\u201d A homeless person sits in his tent just outside the H Barracks site. (Jane Yang/The Epoch Times) \u201cI would prefer to be by myself where all the problems I have are mine. And I don\u2019t have to put any of my problems on anybody else, or have to accept any of theirs,\u201d he said. Scott said he is aware of San Diego\u2019s new law banning encampments on streets. But he said he would still not go to a shelter. \u201cSome people would sleep right on the sidewalk in front of a business. I don\u2019t condone that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have it so it\u2019s not seen to the public, and you are not a nuisance, and you are not causing any problems. We are just doing what we can to survive.\u201d If the city forces him out of his current campsite, he said, \u201cI will go somewhere else.\u201d", "summary": "The mayor proposes a large shelter and a safe parking lot for people living in their cars.

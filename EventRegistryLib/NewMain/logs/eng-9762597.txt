Women are forced to take these steps to minimise the risks they face when going out to enjoy themselves, he said.\n\n\"It is a poor reflection of the safety of women in our society,\" Mr Justice McDermott said.\n\nPeople have a level of trust in the taxi service which is reflected in the many stories of great kindness shown by taxi drivers to members of the public, the judge said.\n\nThese drivers would regard Shorten's actions as a \"gross betrayal,\" he said.\n\nThe judge said Shorten remains a danger to society and that there were few mitigating factors in his favour.\n\nGeraldine Small SC, for the Director of Public Prosecutors, asked that a headline sentence of 10-15 years be considered for the offences relating to the taxi passengers.\n\nOne of the women had not even hailed a taxi on the night in question, and CCTV showed Shorten driving around before stopping the taxi beside her, counsel said. One of women told the judge she got a taxi home \"to be safe\" but experienced the \"worst nightmare\". She continues to suffer anxiety and trust issues as a result of being raped by Raymond Shorten when she was aged 20, the Central Criminal Court heard. What happened to her was \"every parent's worst nightmare\" and her parents were also badly affected.\n\nThe prosecution case was each woman found themselves in a taxi after a night out socialising in Dublin city centre where each was raped by the driver, Shorten.\n\nIn her evidence, the first woman said she drank five pints of cider, an amount she was not used to, on the night of June 25th, 2022.\n\nShe described gaps in her memory of her journey home. She recalled waking up in the front passenger seat of a car in the early hours, with a man driving. She said he moved her to the back seat where he raped her anally and vaginally before returning her to the driver's seat and dropping her near her home.\n\nThe second woman said she was tired and drunk after going for drinks in Dublin city centre on August 8th, 2022. She fell asleep in the back of a taxi and the next thing she remembered was waking up as the driver was raping her. She said she was in shock and didn't know how to fight back. He had asked for \u20ac70 for the taxi fare, she said.\n\nShorten denied rape and said the sexual interactions between him and each of the women was consensual. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts.\n\nIn a victim impact report, one of the women who was aged 19 when raped said: \"It's messed with my intimate life as that was my first time, I was a virgin. I'd say I've made some poor decisions around my dating and intimate life because of it.\"\n\nShe has lost confidence, is uncomfortable in taxis and \"a lot of men in the room is enough to panic me\".\n\n\"I've lost my ability to feel carefree and safe in the streets, and I get flashbacks. It's sickening and unsettling.\"\n\nIn her statement, the second woman said she developed bad feelings of anxiety after the rape, still finds it a challenge to deal with her everyday anxiety and also experienced nightmares and countless sleepless nights.The night of August 8th, 2022, \"has dramatically changed my life in so many ways\".\n\nShe never thought something like that would happen, was always told to get a taxi but what she thought was the safe thing to do turned out to be the \"worst nightmare\".\n\nHer only memory of Shorten is his \"thick Dublin accent\" and she finds it \"triggering\" when she hears similar accents. While she still tries to enjoy nights out, they \"end in tears\" because what Shorten did to her \"is constantly in my thoughts\".\n\nTwo years of her 20s, which are \"meant to be the best days of my life\", have been \"taken away from me\". Her family too has suffered. \"A parent's worst nightmare is for their child to come home and say they have been raped.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McDermott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul McDermott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anal sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Shorten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clondalkin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Court (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerida_Naidoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerida Naidoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_29th_D\u00e1il", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the 29th D\u00e1il"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigating_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitigating factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightmare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vagina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/VFMHJ5RMRVDA3D2FZQWGA6OJ4M.jpg?smart=true&auth=32a4955ea2510986dad5fc9b286f541b8af517a6c6cb4c2226718ee60e79ff21&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762597", "eventUri": "eng-9762597", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6941176470588235, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Mr Harris said: \"I would make an appeal to them to come forward and make complaints to An Garda Siochana.\n\nREAD MORE: Rapist cabbie Raymond Shorten allowed to continue driving taxi as previous convictions not 'serious' enough\n\nREAD MORE: Daughter of rapist taxi driver says she hopes he 'gets what he deserves'\n\n\"This individual has been dealt with through the criminal justice system. He has been dealt with in terms of trial and a verdict has been passed by the jury and he has now been incarcerated.\n\n\"I would say, then, to others who may have been his victim to please come forward to An Garda Siochana and make a complaint.\"\n\nShorten has been jailed to a total of 30 YEARS in prison for the rape of two women - and a child.\n\nToday Father-of-seven Shorten (50), of Melrose Crescent, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison for the rape a then 19 year old woman in June 2022 and another 20 year old woman on August 9 of that year.\n\nThe sentences today will be served consecutively to the 13 years Shorten was handed down earlier this week for the rape of a seven year old child. Dressed in a white shirt with a navy spotted tie and wearing glasses, Shorten kept his head down and remained silent throughout the sentencing.\n\nOne of the victims, who was in court, became tearful and hugged family members when the verdict was read out. Passing sentence today, Mr Justice Paul McDermott said he must consider that Shorten had just been sentenced for raping a child 10 years prior to these offences - and called it a \"serious aggravating factor.\"\n\nHe said that this man \"already raped a child and years later set about committing these offences. He knew exactly what he was doing. He appeared to do it with impunity,\" the Judge said.\n\nMr Justice McDermott said these were cases of \"violence against women\" and commented on what he said was an \"unhappy reality\" where all too often women go out simply to enjoy themselves, but that there is an \"unhealthy attitude\" to women in our society, and the best advice given is to get home safely \"without fear of violence.\"\n\nHe said the option available is for women to take a taxi, and this reflects on the level of trust there is in society for the taxi service. He said there are many stories of the \"great kindness\" of taxi drivers - and said Shorten's offending is a \"gross betrayal\" of that \"high standard of service and professionalism.\"\n\nJudge McDermott said that \"breach of trust\" was clearly an aggravating factor in this case. He said it was \"significant\" that Shorten went on to commit these rape offences \"on two separate women on two separate occasions, who he didn't know.\n\nHe said therefore it \"justifies the imposition of the sentence to be proportionally more severe.\" He said Shorten committed the offences knowing he had committed the rape of a child, and he \"went about identifying two further victims, repeating his offence, without compunction, and without hesitation.\n\nHe did so with a \"complete absence of remorse,\" the Judge said, adding that the nature of his prior offending shows that he \"was and is a danger to others.\" He said that this case involved an \"absolute breach of trust,\" in that the victims trusted Shorten to \"get them safely home because of his job as a taxi driver.\"\n\nThe Judge said the victims are entitled to regard a taxi as a place of safety and security - but that Shorten \"effectively preyed on them.\" He said that Shorten \"doesn't acknowledge his guilt,\" and has \"no remorse,\" is \"completely unrepentant in respect of the damage he inflicted to these two women.\"\n\nHe set the sentences for rape and anal rape at 12 years, and rape of the second victim at 11 years. Judge McDermott said he was satisfied that the first sentence for rape only come into effect after the expiration of Shorten's 13 year sentence for rape of a child.\n\nThe second sentence for rape is to take affect from today's date - with the court hearing that taken together, it would mean an overall 36 years in prison. Judge McDermott said he was taking into account the totality principle and reduced two of the sentences to nine years and 8 years.\n\nThose sentences are not to be served until after Shorten concludes his sentence for the rape of a child. The court heard that this means he will serve a total of 30 years in prison for all three offences.\n\nIn her opening speech of the trial in this case, senior prosecuting counsel Gerardine Small said each woman found themselves in a taxi after a night out socialising in Dublin city centre in the summer of 2022, where they were raped in the vehicle by Shorten.\n\nIn her evidence, the first woman said she drank five pints of cider, an amount she wasn't used to, on the night of June 25, 2022. She described gaps in her memory of her journey home and recalled waking up in the front passenger seat of a car in the early hours, with a man driving.\n\nShe said she felt very dazed and her eyes were heavy. She said the man moved her to the back seat where he raped her anally and vaginally. When he finished, the man returned to the driver's seat, then dropped her near her home.\n\nUnder cross-examination, she accepted there were issues with her memory of that night but strongly rejected the defence's contention that she was an active participant in consensual sexual activity with Shorten.\n\nThe second woman described going for drinks in Dublin city centre on August 8, 2022. She was due to stay with a friend, but decided to get a taxi home as she was tired and drunk. She fell asleep in the back of a taxi and said the next thing she remembered was waking up as the taxi driver was raping her. She said she was in shock and didn't know how to fight back.\n\nAfterwards, he dropped her home where he asked for the fare. She got a charger from the house as her phone had died and went back to the taxi to charge it. One of her parents later paid the fare in cash.\n\nDuring her testimony, the woman became upset as she recounted returning to her house where her parents asked her questions. She said she broke down crying and told them what had happened. Under cross-examination, she rejected the defence's contention that there was mutual kissing, then consensual sexual activity.\n\nHer mother said she was surprised when her daughter arrived home that night. She said her daughter was agitated and crying after the taxi left and she noticed the zip on her jeans was down. Her daughter told her a few minutes later that the taxi driver had raped her. The woman's mother became visibly emotional during her testimony while she recalled replying \"as in him?\"\n\nShe said she was shocked and thought she was going to get sick Shorten didn't give evidence during the trial. Instead, two written statements he provided following his arrest on separate dates were read to the jury. He claimed the sexual activity with the women in his taxi was consensual and initiated by them.\n\nIn her closing speech, Ms Small suggested there is an \"inherent unlikelihood\" that two young women would make similar allegations about the same man within a relatively short period of time. She submitted that Shorten's account was \"ludicrous\" and a \"farce\".\n\nThe sentence comes after Shorten was already jailed earlier this week to 13 years in prison for the rape and sexual abuse of a seven year old child over a decade ago. In that case the trial heard how Shorten raped the victim for the first time in the wake of her mother's funeral - when she would have been \"extremely vulnerable.\"\n\nThe incidents emerged when the young girl left a handwritten note on her grandmother's pillow in 2020, the court heard, telling her what happened. A jury ultimately convicted Shorten, who claimed to gardai that the charges were \"110 per cent a lie.\"\n\nMr Justice Kerida Naidoo said Shorten \"couldn't have cared less\" about the suffering and long term pain of the child - and said he showed a lack of any compassion for them. In a victim impact statement read to the court the victim, who is now an adult, said she was \"severely taken advantage of\" by Shorten - who she said \"always creeped me out.\"\n\nShe said it was only when she started sex education in school at the age of 14 that she realised what Shorten did to her was wrong.\n\nIf you have been affected by the contents of this article, you can contact the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre on their 24-hour helpline on 1800 77 8888 or visit drcc.ie.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

He said therefore it \"justifies the imposition of the sentence to be proportionally more severe.\"\n\nHe said Shorten committed the offences knowing he had committed the rape of a child, and he \"went about identifying two further victims, repeating his offence, without compunction, and without hesitation. He did so with a \"complete absence of remorse,\" the Judge said, adding that the nature of his prior offending shows that he \"was and is a danger to others.\"\n\nHe said that this case involved an \"absolute breach of trust,\" in that the victims trusted Shorten to \"get them safely home because of his job as a taxi driver.\" The Judge said the victims are entitled to regard a taxi as a place of safety and security - but that Shorten \"effectively preyed on them.\"\n\nHe said that Shorten \"doesn't acknowledge his guilt,\" and has \"no remorse,\" is \"completely unrepentant in respect of the damage he inflicted to these two women.\" He set the sentences for rape and anal rape at 12 years, and rape of the second victim at 11 years.\n\nJudge McDermott said he was satisfied that the first sentence for rape only come into effect after the expiration of Shorten's 13 year sentence for rape of a child. The second sentence for rape is to take affect from today's date - with the court hearing that taken together, it would mean an overall 36 years in prison.\n\nJudge McDermott said he was taking into account the totality principle and reduced two of the sentences to nine years and 8 years. Those sentences are not to be served until after Shorten concludes his sentence for the rape of a child.\n\nThe court heard that this means he will serve a total of 30 years in prison for all three offences. In her opening speech of the trial in this case, senior prosecuting counsel Gerardine Small said each woman found themselves in a taxi after a night out socialising in Dublin city centre in the summer of 2022, where they were raped in the vehicle by Shorten.\n\nIn her evidence, the first woman said she drank five pints of cider, an amount she wasn't used to, on the night of June 25, 2022. She described gaps in her memory of her journey home and recalled waking up in the front passenger seat of a car in the early hours, with a man driving.\n\nShe said she felt very dazed and her eyes were heavy. She said the man moved her to the back seat where he raped her anally and vaginally. When he finished, the man returned to the driver's seat, then dropped her near her home.\n\nUnder cross-examination, she accepted there were issues with her memory of that night but strongly rejected the defence's contention that she was an active participant in consensual sexual activity with Shorten. The second woman described going for drinks in Dublin city centre on August 8, 2022. She was due to stay with a friend, but decided to get a taxi home as she was tired and drunk.\n\nShe fell asleep in the back of a taxi and said the next thing she remembered was waking up as the taxi driver was raping her. She said she was in shock and didn't know how to fight back.\n\nAfterwards, he dropped her home where he asked for the fare. She got a charger from the house as her phone had died and went back to the taxi to charge it. One of her parents later paid the fare in cash.\n\nDuring her testimony, the woman became upset as she recounted returning to her house where her parents asked her questions. She said she broke down crying and told them what had happened. Under cross-examination, she rejected the defence's contention that there was mutual kissing, then consensual sexual activity.\n\nHer mother said she was surprised when her daughter arrived home that night. She said her daughter was agitated and crying after the taxi left and she noticed the zip on her jeans was down. Her daughter told her a few minutes later that the taxi driver had raped her.\n\nThe woman's mother became visibly emotional during her testimony while she recalled replying \"as in him?\" She said she was shocked and thought she was going to get sick.\n\nShorten didn't give evidence during the trial. Instead, two written statements he provided following his arrest on separate dates were read to the jury. He claimed the sexual activity with the women in his taxi was consensual and initiated by them.\n\nIn her closing speech, Ms Small suggested there is an \"inherent unlikelihood\" that two young women would make similar allegations about the same man within a relatively short period of time. She submitted that Shorten's account was \"ludicrous\" and a \"farce\".\n\nThe sentence comes after Shorten was already jailed earlier this week to 13 years in prison for the rape and sexual abuse of a seven year old child over a decade ago. In that case the trial heard how Shorten raped the victim for the first time in the wake of her mother's funeral - when she would have been \"extremely vulnerable.\"\n\nThe incidents emerged when the young girl left a handwritten note on her grandmother's pillow in 2020, the court heard, telling her what happened. A jury ultimately convicted Shorten, who claimed to gardai that the charges were \"110 per cent a lie.\"\n\nMr Justice Kerida Naidoo said Shorten \"couldn't have cared less\" about the suffering and long term pain of the child - and said he showed a lack of any compassion for them. In a victim impact statement read to the court the victim, who is now an adult, said she was \"severely taken advantage of\" by Shorten - who she said \"always creeped me out.\"\n\nShe said it was only when she started sex education in school at the age of 14 that she realised what Shorten did to her was wrong.", "source": {"uri": "dublinlive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dublin Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_healy@dublinlive.ie", "name": "Paul Healy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McDermott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul McDermott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Shorten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Position of trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aggravation (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clondalkin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single transferable vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anal sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerida_Naidoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerida Naidoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vagina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/article29610551.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_js336702503.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762597", "eventUri": "eng-9762597", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 155, "textEnd": 163, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Shorten bowed his head but did not react as the sentence was passed.\n\nThe father-of-seven from Melrose Crescent, Clondalkin, Dublin, had pleaded not guilty to raping the woman on dates in 2022 but was found guilty by a jury.\n\nJudge McDermott said women too often become subject to violence and the steps they were forced to take to avoid the risk reflected this reality.\n\n\"It indicates an underlying unhealthy attitude towards women and their fundamental rights in any society if their sense of freedom and security in doing normal things is so compromised,\" he said.\n\nSociety placed trust in the taxi service and Shorten's actions could be regarded as \"a gross betrayal\" of its \"high standard of service and professionalism.\"\n\nThe judge said it was also significant that having previously raped a child, Shorten \"went about identifying the two further victims\" and repeated the offence \"without compunction, without hesitation\".\n\nThe crimes were \"carried out in the most humiliating and demeaning fashion\" when the victims were drunk and incapable of dealing with him, and he \"took advantage of that\".\n\nIt was an \"absolute breach of trust\" of those depending on him to get them safely home, the judge said. They were \"entitled to regard the taxi as a place of safety and security.\" The victims were vulnerable and he \"effectively preyed on them.\"\n\nOne victim did not hail his taxi and was \"targeted\". Shorten \"knew exactly what he was doing and appeared to think he could do it with impunity,\" Judge McDermott said.\n\nThe mitigating factors were few, the court heard. \"He doesn't acknowledge his guilt, and he's exhibited no regret, no remorse for what he's done,\" the judge said. He was \"completely unrepentant for the damage he's inflicted\" on these women, he said.\n\n\"He claims he did nothing wrong,\" the judge said, and it was clear that Shorten \"was and remains a danger to others\".\n\nThe judge was not satisfied that it would be appropriate to make the sentences concurrent as multiple victims were involved. He sentenced Shorten to nine years on one count, consecutive to the previous 13 years for the child rape. He was given another eight years consecutive to the nine, and a further 12 years concurrent.\n\nThis resulted in 17 years imposed today and 30 years in total. Shorten is to undergo 10 years of post-release supervision, have no contact with the victims and no unsupervised contact with any child.\n\nAt trial, a jury heard Shorten raped the first woman (19) on June 26, 2022. She had drunk five pints of cider, which she was not used to, and got separated from her friends.\n\nShe woke up in the front seat of his taxi, feeling \"numb\" and he stopped the cab and moved her to the back seat where he raped her as she fell in and out of consciousness. He dropped her near her home after the attack.\n\nShorten was later identified on CCTV which showed his taxi performing two u-turns, then pulling over beside the woman, who had not hailed him. He attacked the second woman (20) less than two months later, on August 9, 2022.\n\nThis woman had decided to get a taxi home as she was tired and drunk after a night out in the city centre. She fell asleep in the back of Shorten's cab and the next thing she remembered was waking up as he was raping her.\n\nShe said she was in shock and did not know how to fight back. When he dropped her home, he asked for the \u20ac70 fare. The victims said Shorten was a \"predator\" and what should have been their \"safest option\" for getting home after a night out became a \"worst nightmare.\"\n\nShorten claimed he had had consensual sex with the women, which they had initiated.\n\nOn Monday, Shorten was jailed for the rape and sexual assault of a girl in 2012.\n\nHe raped her for the first time in a bathroom at her family home in the days following her mother's funeral. She was seven or eight when the second rape occurred.\n\nShorten, who was known to the girl's family, later sexually assaulted her in a car by touching her leg inappropriately. He denied any wrongdoing and claimed the complaints were \"total fabrications.\"\n\nDublin Rape Crisis Centre strongly welcomed the length of the sentence handed down today.\n\nDRCC chief executive Rachel Morrogh said: \"Dublin Rape Crisis Centre welcomes the sentence of 17 years handed down to rapist Raymond Shorten today. We are also very thankful for the ruling by Mr Justice Paul McDermott that this sentence will run consecutively to the 13-year sentence given earlier this week for his rape of a seven-year-old girl.\n\n\"The total jail term of 30 years is effectively equivalent to a life sentence. It is another significant sentence given by the courts in recent weeks to perpetrators of sexual offences and should give great hope to people going through the justice system that this most heinous crime will be punished by lengthy imprisonment.\n\n\"As well as being welcomed by victims of sexual violence, the sentence should also send a message of zero tolerance to perpetrators. In this particular case, Raymond Shorten abused the trust placed in him by two young women to get home safely and took advantage of the fact they were vulnerable. He compounded the trauma he caused by denying all charges and attempting to discredit his victims.\n\n\"From start to finish, Raymond Shorten's actions were part of a playbook used by rapists. Abusing trust and taking advantage of an unequal power dynamic are well-worn tactics. The jury that found Raymond Shorten guilty in June clearly saw through these efforts and Mr Justice Paul McDermott has driven home the seriousness of his crimes with the 17-year jail term announced today.\n\n\"It is the hope of Dublin Rape Crisis Centre that the trend of substantial sentences being handed down for sexual crimes continues, and that this will encourage more victims to report to Gardai.\n\n\"Sadly, this country is not yet at a point where the elimination of sexual violence is in sight. Until that day comes, sexual crimes must be punished severely and that was certainly the case today.\"\n\n\"We send wishes of healing and strength to the three young women who were attacked by Shorten and we thank them for speaking out,\" said Ms Morrogh.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McDermott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul McDermott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Shorten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clondalkin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigating_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitigating factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zero tolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex and the law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762597", "eventUri": "eng-9762597", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

He was separately convicted at the Central Criminal Court in June of three rape offences, which occurred in 2022.\n\nThe court previously heard that the two young women in this case had separately found themselves in a taxi after a night out socialising and drinking in Dublin city centre in the summer of 2022, where Shorten raped them.\n\nIn his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice McDermott said this case was about violence against women in society and the steps they must take to avoid or minimise this risk. He said the case reflects the \"unhappy reality\" that women \"too often become the subject of sexual or other forms of physical violence, or the threat of it, when they go out to simply enjoy themselves\".\n\nThe judge said this indicates \"an underlying unhealthy attitude towards women and their fundamental rights in any society, if their sense of freedom and security in doing normal things is so compromised\".\n\nHe said it is a \"poor reflection on the level of security and safety of women\" who go for a night out that the best advice to get home safely and \"without fear of violent attack by a male, or without unwanted attention\" is not to get a bus or walk home alone, which they should be able to do.\n\nMr Justice McDermott said using a taxi is a \"reasonable\" option and reflects the \"level of trust\" in that service. The judge said there are many stories of the \"great kindness and helpfulness\" of taxi drivers and that Shorten's behaviour would be regarded as \"a gross betrayal of that high standard of service and professionalism\".\n\nHe said this is one of the reasons why this case had resonated with people and that breach of trust is an aggravating feature. Mr Justice McDermott said it was a \"disturbing feature\" of the case that Shorten has also been convicted of sexually abusing a child.\n\nThe judge noted the 13-year sentence imposed in relation to Shorten's offending against the young girl and said it was \"significant\" that he went on to repeat his offence against women he didn't know \"without compunction or hesitation\".\n\nHe said Shorten identified two further victims, deliberately took advantage of their vulnerability and carried out the offences in the \"most humiliating and demeaning\" manner. He said Shorten had breached the trust of the victims, who expected him to get them home safely, and that the taxi should have been a place of security for them.\n\nThe judge said Shorten \"effectively preyed\" on both women, who were intoxicated and vulnerable, and that there was evidence he \"targeted\" the first victim, who had not hailed a taxi. He said Shorten does not accept the jury's verdict, maintains his innocence and has shown no remorse.\n\nHe said Shorten was \"completely unrepentant\" for the damage inflicted on the victims in this case.\n\nThe judge acknowledged that Shorten is entitled to maintain that he did nothing wrong, but that this is a concern. However, Mr Justice McDermott said it is clear that Shorten \"was, and remains, a danger to others,\" in light of his previous offending.\n\n\"This is a man who had already raped a child and years later set out to commit these offences within a short period of each other. He knew exactly what he was doing and appeared to do it with impunity,\" he said.\n\nHe noted the harm, both physical and mental, caused to the victims in this case.\n\nThe judge said the two women had \"acted with great dignity and courage\" by reporting the offences and giving evidence during the trial. Mr Justice McDermott said that while a severe sentence is required in this case, he would not impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\n\nThe judge said there are \"few\" mitigating features in this case, but he had considered Shorten's family background and personal circumstances as outlined to the court. While Shorten's offences against the young girl in 2012 were completely separate and distinct from this offending in 2022, the judge said he made a choice to commit two further rape offences and this had to be reflected in the sentence.\n\nMr Justice McDermott said he had considered the sentencing principles of proportionality and totality.\n\nHe handed Shorten a nine-year sentence in respect of the first count of rape against the 19-year-old victim, to run consecutively to the 13-year sentence imposed on Monday. He then imposed a sentence of eight years for the rape of the second victim, which is consecutive to the nine-year sentence.\n\nHe imposed a 12-year sentence on the final count of rape, which is to run from the date of conviction.\n\nMr Justice McDermott declined to suspend any portion of the sentence, and imposed a ten-year period of post-release supervision on Shorten. He further directed Shorten is not to contact the victims in any way or to have unsupervised contact with a child.\n\nMr Justice McDermott granted an application from the defence to extend legal aid in the event of an appeal.\n\nOn Monday, while sentencing Shorten for the rape of the seven-year-old girl, Mr Justice Kerida Naidoo noted that the first incident occurred in the days following the funeral of the child's mother. The judge said this showed a lack of \"any compassion for the child\" who would have been very vulnerable at the time.\n\nHe said the aggravating features of that case included the \"deep and abiding damage\" caused to the victim.\n\nThese offences came to light in 2020 after the child left a note on her grandmother's pillow. In her victim impact statement, the now-20-year-old said it was only when she started sex education in school at the age of 14 that she understood what Shorten did was wrong.\n\nShe said: \"he should have protected me, not abused me.\"\n\nIn relation to Shorten's 2022 offending, the court was previously told that the first victim had been drinking and socialising with friends on the night of June 25.\n\nShe had a limited memory of her journey home, but recalled waking up in the front passenger seat of a car. She said a man stopped the car, then moved her into the back seat where he raped her anally and vaginally. She said it was very sore and she was falling in and out of consciousness.\n\nWhen he finished, the man returned to the driver's seat, then dropped her near her home.\n\nIn her victim impact statement, this woman described Shorten as a \"predator\" and said it was \"shocking\" that he raped two women. She said she had lost the ability to \"feel carefree and safe in the streets\".\n\nThe second victim decided to get a taxi home after socialising in Dublin city centre on August 9 as she was tired and drunk. She fell asleep in the back of Shorten's taxi and said the next thing she remembered was waking up as he raped her. She said she was in shock and didn't know how to fight back.\n\nAfterwards, he dropped her home where he asked for the \u20ac70 fare.\n\nIn her victim impact statement, this woman said she was told taking a taxi was the \"safest option\" after a night out. She said she did what every girl is told is safe, but it turned out to be \"someone's worst nightmare\".\n\nShe said she tries to go out socialising, but \"now my nights out usually end in tears because of what (Shorten) did to me.\"\n\nShorten was identified from CCTV and when interviewed, said the sexual contact with both women was consensual.\n\nLorcan Staines SC, defending, said his client is a father of seven children and hopes to re-build his relationship with them in future. Mr Staines said his client has lost his marriage and relationship with his parents.\n\nShorten has a long work history, most recently as a taxi driver.", "source": {"uri": "donegallive.ie",

He said Shorten \"couldn't have cared less\" about the long-term pain and suffering this would have caused to the girl.\n\nMr Justice Naidoo said the victim impact statement described the \"deep and abiding damage\" caused to the injured party.\n\nSetting a headline sentence of 14 years on the rape counts, Mr Justice Naidoo said there was \"very little to mitigate his wrong\" but said he had considered Shorten's personal circumstance and the available mitigation, reducing the sentence by one year to 13 years.\n\nHe backdated it to August 22nd 2022 when Shorten went into custody.\n\nMr Justice Naidoo noted Shorten is due to be sentenced on other offences and that these have \"no impact on this case\". He said the issue of post-release supervision and rehabilitation could be considered once the other sentence is finalised.\n\nShorten was also convicted in June of two counts of rape and one of anal rape in relation to two other young women who separately found themselves in a taxi after a night out socialising in Dublin during the summer of 2022.\n\nThe trial judge, Mr Justice Paul McDermott, previously said he would impose sentence after Mr Justice Naidoo has finalised sentence in relation to the offences involving the young girl.\n\nShorten has been in custody since August 2022.\n\nThe court previously heard that the sexual abuse of the young girl came to light after she left a handwritten note on her grandmother's pillow in 2020.\n\nAn investigating garda told the court that Shorten, then 37, was known to the girl's family.\n\nHe raped the girl for the first time in a bathroom at her family home in the days following her mother's funeral. She was seven or eight when the second rape occurred. Shorten later sexually assaulted her in a car by touching her leg inappropriately.\n\nShorten denied any wrongdoing when interviewed by garda\u00ed and in his evidence during the trial. He does not accept responsibility for the offences, defence senior counsel Lorcan Staines told the court at the previous sentence hearing.\n\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court by prosecuting counsel Gerardine Small SC, the woman said she was \"severely taken advantage of\" by Shorten, whom she never liked.\n\nShe said \"he always creeped me out\" and she didn't want to go near him. She said she was terrified and didn't understand what was happening.\n\nShe said it was only when she started sex education in school at the age of 14 that she realised what Shorten did to her was wrong.\n\nShe said when Shorten was convicted, she felt she'd \"finally found the beginning of the end\".\n\nShe added that Shorten \"should have protected me, not abused me\".\n\nAt the earlier hearing, Mr Staines asked the court to backdate any sentence to August 2022, when his client went into custody.\n\nHe said Shorten has a long work history and hopes to rebuild his relationship with his seven children in the future.\n\nShorten has been working in the prison laundry while in custody and is on an enhanced prisoner regime.", "source": {"uri": "beat102103.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beat 102-103"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Shorten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clondalkin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clondalkin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerida_Naidoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerida Naidoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victim impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McDermott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul McDermott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anal sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staines-upon-Thames", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staines-upon-Thames"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Staines-upon-Thames"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/beat102103/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltZy5iZWF0MTAyMTAzLmNvbVxcXC9wcm9kXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMTE3MDg5OC0xLmpwZWdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvZXUtY2VudHJhbC0xLmxpbm9kZW9iamVjdHMuY29tXFxcL3BwbHVzLmltZy5iZWF0MTAyMTAzLmNvbVxcXC9wcm9kXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvQmVhdC1Oby1JbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiNDZmZjNlOTg2M2NmNDY0NmYzMzZjZmU5NzFmMTYwODAwYTQ1ODg0ZCJ9/taxi-driver-to-sentenced-today-for-raping-two-female-passengers.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762597", "eventUri": "eng-9762597", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1029, "textEnd": 1038}], "sentiment": -0.607843137254902, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Dressed in a white shirt with a navy spotted tie and wearing glasses, Shorten kept his head down and remained silent throughout the sentencing.\n\nREAD MORE: Rapist cabbie Raymond Shorten allowed to continue driving taxi as previous convictions not 'serious' enough\n\nREAD MORE: Daughter of rapist taxi driver says she hopes he 'gets what he deserves'\n\nOne of the victims, who was in court, became tearful and hugged family members when the verdict was read out. Passing sentence today, Mr Justice Paul McDermott said he must consider that Shorten had just been sentenced for raping a child 10 years prior to these offences - and called it a \"serious aggravating factor.\"\n\nHe said that this man \"already raped a child and years later set about committing these offences. He knew exactly what he was doing. He appeared to do it with impunity,\" the Judge said.\n\nMr Justice McDermott said these were cases of \"violence against women\" and commented on what he said was an \"unhappy reality\" where all too often women go out simply to enjoy themselves, but that there is an \"unhealthy attitude\" to women in our society, and the best advice given is to get home safely \"without fear of violence.\"\n\nHe said the option available is for women to take a taxi, and this reflects on the level of trust there is in society for the taxi service. He said there are many stories of the \"great kindness\" of taxi drivers - and said Shorten's offending is a \"gross betrayal\" of that \"high standard of service and professionalism.\"\n\nJudge McDermott said that \"breach of trust\" was clearly an aggravating factor in this case. He said it was \"significant\" that Shorten went on to commit these rape offences \"on two separate women on two separate occasions, who he didn't know.\n\nHe said therefore it \"justifies the imposition of the sentence to be proportionally more severe.\" He said Shorten committed the offences knowing he had committed the rape of a child, and he \"went about identifying two further victims, repeating his offence, without compunction, and without hesitation.\n\nHe did so with a \"complete absence of remorse,\" the Judge said, adding that the nature of his prior offending shows that he \"was and is a danger to others.\" He said that this case involved an \"absolute breach of trust,\" in that the victims trusted Shorten to \"get them safely home because of his job as a taxi driver.\"\n\nThe Judge said the victims are entitled to regard a taxi as a place of safety and security - but that Shorten \"effectively preyed on them.\" He said that Shorten \"doesn't acknowledge his guilt,\" and has \"no remorse,\" is \"completely unrepentant in respect of the damage he inflicted to these two women.\"\n\nHe set the sentences for rape and anal rape at 12 years, and rape of the second victim at 11 years. Judge McDermott said he was satisfied that the first sentence for rape only come into effect after the expiration of Shorten's 13 year sentence for rape of a child.\n\nThe second sentence for rape is to take affect from today's date - with the court hearing that taken together, it would mean an overall 36 years in prison. Judge McDermott said he was taking into account the totality principle and reduced two of the sentences to nine years and 8 years.\n\nThose sentences are not to be served until after Shorten concludes his sentence for the rape of a child. The court heard that this means he will serve a total of 30 years in prison for all three offences.\n\nIn her opening speech of the trial in this case, senior prosecuting counsel Gerardine Small said each woman found themselves in a taxi after a night out socialising in Dublin city centre in the summer of 2022, where they were raped in the vehicle by Shorten.\n\nIn her evidence, the first woman said she drank five pints of cider, an amount she wasn't used to, on the night of June 25, 2022. She described gaps in her memory of her journey home and recalled waking up in the front passenger seat of a car in the early hours, with a man driving.\n\nShe said she felt very dazed and her eyes were heavy. She said the man moved her to the back seat where he raped her anally and vaginally. When he finished, the man returned to the driver's seat, then dropped her near her home.\n\nUnder cross-examination, she accepted there were issues with her memory of that night but strongly rejected the defence's contention that she was an active participant in consensual sexual activity with Shorten.\n\nThe second woman described going for drinks in Dublin city centre on August 8, 2022. She was due to stay with a friend, but decided to get a taxi home as she was tired and drunk. She fell asleep in the back of a taxi and said the next thing she remembered was waking up as the taxi driver was raping her. She said she was in shock and didn't know how to fight back.\n\nAfterwards, he dropped her home where he asked for the fare. She got a charger from the house as her phone had died and went back to the taxi to charge it. One of her parents later paid the fare in cash.\n\nDuring her testimony, the woman became upset as she recounted returning to her house where her parents asked her questions. She said she broke down crying and told them what had happened. Under cross-examination, she rejected the defence's contention that there was mutual kissing, then consensual sexual activity.\n\nHer mother said she was surprised when her daughter arrived home that night. She said her daughter was agitated and crying after the taxi left and she noticed the zip on her jeans was down. Her daughter told her a few minutes later that the taxi driver had raped her. The woman's mother became visibly emotional during her testimony while she recalled replying \"as in him?\"\n\nShe said she was shocked and thought she was going to get sick Shorten didn't give evidence during the trial. Instead, two written statements he provided following his arrest on separate dates were read to the jury. He claimed the sexual activity with the women in his taxi was consensual and initiated by them.\n\nIn her closing speech, Ms Small suggested there is an \"inherent unlikelihood\" that two young women would make similar allegations about the same man within a relatively short period of time. She submitted that Shorten's account was \"ludicrous\" and a \"farce\".\n\nThe sentence comes after Shorten was already jailed earlier this week to 13 years in prison for the rape and sexual abuse of a seven year old child over a decade ago. In that case the trial heard how Shorten raped the victim for the first time in the wake of her mother's funeral - when she would have been \"extremely vulnerable.\"\n\nThe incidents emerged when the young girl left a handwritten note on her grandmother's pillow in 2020, the court heard, telling her what happened. A jury ultimately convicted Shorten, who claimed to gardai that the charges were \"110 per cent a lie.\"\n\nMr Justice Kerida Naidoo said Shorten \"couldn't have cared less\" about the suffering and long term pain of the child - and said he showed a lack of any compassion for them. In a victim impact statement read to the court the victim, who is now an adult, said she was \"severely taken advantage of\" by Shorten - who she said \"always creeped me out.\"\n\nShe said it was only when she started sex education in school at the age of 14 that she realised what Shorten did to her was wrong.\n\nIf you have been affected by the contents of this article, you can contact the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre on their 24-hour helpline on 1800 77 8888 or visit drcc.ie.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Earlier this week, Shorten received a 13-year-sentence for raping a girl twice when she was seven or eight years old on dates more than 10 years ago.\n\nCommenting on the case, Mr Harris said there was a \"reasonable proposition\" convicted rapist Raymond Shorten had attacked other women, in cases that had not come to light. He urged other victims to contact the Garda force.\n\n\"I would make an appeal to them to come forward and make complaints,\" the commissioner said speaking to the media after a public meeting of the Policing Authority in Dublin on Thursday. \"This individual has been dealt with through the criminal justice system.\n\n\"He has been dealt with in terms of trial and a verdict has been passed by the jury and he has now been incarcerated. I would say, then, to others who may have been his victim to please come forward to An Garda Siochana and make a complaint.\"\n\nGarda\u00ed have confirmed when the two women, aged 19 and 20 years, came forward with complaints they were raped by Shorten, his PSV licence was reviewed and suspended. That occurred from the time the investigation began.\n\nShorten (50) of Melrose Crescent, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, was found guilty of two counts of rape and one of anal rape by a jury at the Central Criminal Court last month.\n\nHe had pleaded not guilty to the rape and anal rape of a 19-year-old woman on June 26th, 2022, and to the rape of another woman, then aged 20, a couple of months later on August 9th, 2022.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Justice Paul McDermott imposed nine years in relation to one victim and eight years for the rape of the second. These will run consecutively. Earlier this week, Shorten received a 13-year-sentence for raping a girl twice when she was seven or eight years old on dates more than 10 years ago.\n\nIn her evidence, the first woman said she drank five pints of cider, an amount she was not used to, on the night of June 25th, 2022. She described gaps in her memory of her journey home. She recalled waking up in the front passenger seat of a car in the early hours, with a man driving. She said he moved her to the back seat where he raped her anally and vaginally before returning her to the driver's seat and dropping her near her home.\n\nThe second woman said she was tired and drunk after going for drinks in Dublin city centre on August 8th, 2022. She fell asleep in the back of a taxi and the next thing she remembered was waking up as the driver was raping her. She said she was in shock and didn't know how to fight back.

Three women who had consensual sex with Shorten were called as defence witnesses.\n\nThe witnesses were forced to attend under threat of being held in contempt of court. One was in tears before taking the stand. The tactic failed and Shorten was convicted on all counts on June 14th.\n\nFollowing the conviction, it could be publicly reported that Shorten had already been convicted for raping a seven-year-old girl who was known to him. Those offences occurred more than a decade ago, but he was convicted only last May.\n\nThe matter was raised in the D\u00e1il, where several TDs questioned the effectiveness of Garda vetting procedures in light of the case.\n\n\"When people use a taxi, they think everything is okay because drivers are vetted and we hope they will bring our children, family members and friends home safely,\" said Paul Donnelly, Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Dublin West.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that system needs to be looked at again to figure out how this happened. How was that person allowed to drive a taxi at that time? That is an important issue that needs to be looked at.\"\n\nOf course, the vast majority of taxi drivers are not dangerous, something noted by Mr Justice Paul McDermott in his sentencing remarks. Shorten's actions were a \"great betrayal\" to his profession, the judge said.\n\nA Garda spokeswoman echoed this views: \"Individual cases such as Raymond Shorten are in the tiny minority who do not represent their professional colleagues.\"\n\nHowever, according to the Rape Crisis Centre (RCC), it cannot be ignored that women face the risk, however small, of sexual assault when getting a taxi. According to data from sexual assault treatment units (SATU), in the last two years 18 people have been raped or sexually assaulted in a taxi (the data does not say if the victim was the passenger or driver).\n\nThe RCC pointed out these numbers likely represent only a fraction of the true figure as they only capture cases where the victim attended a SATU.\n\n\"There must be urgency in getting these numbers down and preventing these assaults from happening,\" RCC chief executive Rachel Morrogh said.\n\nSome TDs and others seemed to be under the impression that Shorten was operating a taxi while he was already charged or convicted in relation to the rape of the young girl.\n\nHowever, this is not accurate. The investigation into Shorten for raping the child on dates more than 10 years ago began only in late 2020. He was still under investigation, but not charged, when he raped the two female passengers in the summer of 2022.\n\n[ 'A gross betrayal': Taxi driver Raymond Shorten jailed for 17 years for rape of two young passengersOpens in new window ]\n\nHe was charged in relation to the attacks on passengers in August 2022 and went into custody while awaiting trial. At this point his licence was revoked.\n\nIn September 2022 he was charged with the abuse of the young girl and again remanded in custody.\n\nThis means that at no point was Shorten driving a taxi while charged, much less convicted, in relation to a sexual offence (although he had a number of previous convictions for road traffic offences and other minor matters).\n\nHowever, he was operating a taxi while under active investigation for the rape of a child and it was during this period that he attacked the two passengers.\n\nThis raises the question of whether Shorten's licence should have been suspended earlier on public safety grounds.\n\nGarda\u00ed have discretion to revoke licences if they think a driver may be a danger to others. After all, they did just that after Shorten was charged with the attacks on the two women. However, they are under no automatic obligation to do so.\n\nIn response to queries, Garda Headquarters noted Shorten's conviction and said it took its responsibility as the current to grant taxi licences \"very seriously and with the utmost gravity\".\n\nAsked if the regulations need to be tightened, the Department of Justice said Minister for Justice Helen McEntee \"will work with the Garda Commissioner and Government colleagues to further identify what needs to be done to put robust systems and processes in place for all professions that may be engaging with vulnerable people\".\n\nIt said the Minister had asked that the taxi licensing system \"receive priority attention\".\n\nThe vetting system for taxi drivers is currently being reviewed and \"any proposals for reform in that regard will be implemented without delay,\" a department spokesman said.\n\nThis approach has been welcomed by Ms Morrogh of the RCC. \"Women should be able to live in this country with the realistic expectation that they are safe from rape and sexual violence,\" she said.\n\n\"Yet time and time again, we see that there is a still a long way to go before that happens. \"Until the day comes when sexual violence is eliminated and the predatory behaviours showcased by Raymond Shorten and countless others are absent from Irish life, we cannot miss any opportunity to keep women safe.\"\n\nGarda advice on taxi safety\n\nThe Garda has offered the following advice on how passengers can safely use taxis:\n\n\u00b7 Plan your journey. Plan how you are going to get there and how you are going to return.\n\n\u00b7 Let people know where you are going and how long you should be.\n\n\u00b7 Let your friends know if you are leaving with someone outside of the group.

Still not admitting his crimes, still trying to blame his innocent victims - a dangerous, deluded, remorseless liar.\n\nHe made them suffer in his perverted way to the very last, choosing to put them through the added trauma of a jury trial.\n\nNaturally, he didn't have the guts to give evidence himself.\n\nAfter sentence was passed, Raymond Shorten picked up the dark suit jacket he brought with him to look the part in the dock. But when he stood, he was wearing a pair of grubby, ill-fitting jeans.\n\nHe couldn't even dress himself properly for court.\n\nBefore Thursday's hearing began, people who attended his recent trials for raping a child in 2010 and the rape of two women on separate occasions 12 years later told us how quiet and nondescript he is, as if to dampen expectations of what an evil sexual predator should look like.\n\nThe 50-year-old father of seven didn't look like a monster.\n\nAnd now he will serve 30 years behind bars for his vile offences.\n\nMr Justice Paul McDermott did the State some service when he sentenced the Dublin taxi driver to a total of 17 years for raping two defenceless women - barely out of their teens - who had trusted him to take them home after a night out.\n\nHe ordered that this time be served on top of the 13-year sentence imposed on him on Monday by Judge Kerida Naidoo for the rape of a seven-year-old girl in her grandmother's house shortly after her mother's death. He raped the child on another occasion after that and also sexually assaulted her.\n\nIt was just after 11am in the Central Criminal Court when Shorten's case was called. A door in the side panelling opened and the serial rapist, watched by prison officers, took his seat alone in the dock. He immediately bowed his head and stayed like that for almost all of the proceedings.\n\nOne of his brave victims sat in the body of the court, surrounded by her family. She listened intently as the judgment was read, sometimes resting her chin on her hand as the horrific detail of the ordeal she suffered at the hands of her unrepentant attacker was outlined once more.\n\nHe might have been afraid to look at her. She wasn't afraid to look at him.\n\nPaul McDermott, the presiding judge in the Central Criminal Court, prefaced his verdict with remarks about violence against women in Irish society. He is well placed to comment: during the long housekeeping list conducted at the start of the morning when the ordering of future cases came before him, rape and murder and male defendants loomed large.\n\nHe noted that the way women are encouraged or forced to remain vigilant against the threat of violence \"reflects the reality that women too often become the subject of sexual or other forms of physical violence or the threat of it when they go out to simply enjoy themselves\".\n\n\"It indicates an underlying unhealthy attitude towards women and their fundamental rights in any society, if their sense of freedom and security in doing normal things is so compromised.\"\n\nNothing new in what the judge had to say, but still depressingly necessary for him to say it.\n\n\"It is a poor reflection on the level of security and safety of women in our society who go out for an evening that the best advice on getting home safely and without fear of violent attack by a male, or without unwanted attention, is not to get a bus or walk home alone - they should of course be able to do so without fear of interference from men.\"\n\nThis is why women are often advised that the reasonable option is to get a taxi. \"We know of many stories of great kindness and helpfulness given on a daily basis by taxi drivers to their customers or others.\"\n\nHe said Raymond Shorten's actions represent \"a gross betrayal\" of that high standard of professionalism and is one of the reasons the case has resonated so much with people.\n\nThen he outlined to the hushed courtroom what happened to the women on two nights in 2022 - one in June and the other in August.\n\nThere was a brittle, edgy atmosphere in courtroom six as he spoke. Looking around the benches at the lawyers and solicitors, the Courts Service people, garda\u00ed and members of the media, women far outnumbered men.\n\nIt must be true when they say there is less money in crime.\n\nThe rapist sat in the courtroom, a balding, bespectacled, hunched figure. Perhaps, in a nod to his undoubted vanity, his greying hair was teased into a wispy little quiff at the front.\n\nThe judge listed the \"huge effect\" his crimes \"carried out in the most humiliating and demeaning fashion\" had on his victims.\n\nThey have suffered intrusive thoughts, nightmares, anxiety, difficulty forming relationships and trusting people and long years dominated by what this monster did to them, compounded by the long wait for a trial.\n\nShorten raped a child. Twelve years later \"a 48-year-old man in a dominant position\", he raped again.\n\n\"He knew exactly what he was doing,\" said the judge, noting his \"complete absence of remorse\" and rejection of the evidence. He continues to maintains he did nothing wrong and everything that happened in his taxi was all consensual.\n\nThe only time there was a flicker of awareness from this unrepentant predator was when the judge began discussing the length of sentence he was going to impose. Then his head wobbled a little.\n\n\"Both women acted with great dignity and courage,\" said Paul McDermott, before delivering his verdict.\n\nIt would all amount to 30 years.\n\nWith any luck, he won't get out until he's 80.

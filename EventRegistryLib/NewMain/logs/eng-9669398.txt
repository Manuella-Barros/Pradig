Conservatives.\n\nRELATED: No election deal as leaders of BC United and Conservatives trade scathing comments\n\nProfessor David Black, a political communications expert at Greater Victoria's Royal Roads University, says B.C.'s fixed election date law puts parties in constant campaign mode, but the battle on the right has heightened awareness of the coming election.\n\nBlack says people usually tune out politics during the summer months, but the feuding between BC United and the Conservatives is keeping the public's attention on the distant election.\n\nEby says his government is making progress on health, housing and the economy and he wants that to continue.", "source": {"uri": "cheknews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHEK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_British_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Eby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_United", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BC United"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rustad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Rustad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Falcon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Official_Opposition_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_election_dates_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed election dates in Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.cheknews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20152057/c3750149-0bdd-42a4-bff7-c48a63d82074-scaled-e1718922086551.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669398", "eventUri": "eng-9669398", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 382, "textEnd": 389}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-19", "textStart": 450, "textEnd": 457}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 90, "textEnd": 97}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

After federal Immigration Minister Marc Miller said the premier was \"confused\" and mistook asylum seekers for regular immigrants, Eby released a media statement.\n\nHe said Miller was \"disingenuous to say this is about asylum seekers\" and added another shot: \"Ottawa is spending billions to build car factories in Ontario and Quebec but has so far refused to put in their fair share to replace the Massey Crossing.\"\n\nThe Massey Tunnel replacement project has a huge $4.1 billion price tag and the B.C. government has made getting federal funding for it a top priority.\n\nBut Eby wasn't done yet.\n\nThe next day he slammed Ottawa for its Sustained Investment Fund allocations to the provinces, saying that on a per capita basis, Ontario and Quebec both get twice as much funding as B.C. receives under the program.\n\nNow, a western-based premier attacking the central federal government is something of a time-honored tradition. But a B.C. premier has not been this critical of Ottawa for years.\n\nEby's predecessor, John Horgan, had such a positive relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau it was dubbed a \"bromance.\" But that occurred during the worst times of the pandemic when many leaders put political differences aside to work together.\n\nThose days are clearly over.\n\nThere are considerable political advantages to Eby in using this approach.\n\nHe is squaring off against a federal government and a prime minister who both appear to be deeply unpopular in this province and he can also be seen as fighting for B.C.'s interests against the big, bad folks from Ottawa.\n\nIt also separates him from his two provincial opponents. Being the premier, he alone gets to speak for B.C., while BC United leader Kevin Falcon and BC Conservative leader John Rustad can only watch from the sidelines.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Eby's pointed attacks will send more federal dollars B.C.'s way, but with a federal election set for next year the Trudeau government needs to rebuild its support in this province, and nothing quite talks like money.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehorse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehorse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Eby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Miller_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Miller (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29th_Canadian_Ministry", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "29th Canadian Ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Immigration,_Refugees_and_Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_United", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BC United"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_British_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Horgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rustad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Rustad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Falcon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240607190652-0378db2ecbc530b714030261943d3871918ad507ca6f15c50c09d4ba376bb33f_0941e4.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669398", "eventUri": "eng-9669398", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It's possible that third-party (ads) could be one of those issues.\"\n\nWhat's certain, however, is that the government will likely hold many more pressers announcing - or re-announcing - plans in crucial ridings like Surrey in the lead-up to this fall's election.", "source": {"uri": "bc.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Eby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_United", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BC United"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rustad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Rustad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Falcon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_Corporation_of_British_Columbia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance Corporation of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district (Canada)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/18/david-eby-1-6932273-1718763055120.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669398", "eventUri": "eng-9669398", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 1214, "textEnd": 1221}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

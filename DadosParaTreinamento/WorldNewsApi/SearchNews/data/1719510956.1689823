If the Oilers were to go on and win the Stanley Cup in 2024 Leon Draisaitl would get my vote for the Conn Smyth. His 25 points in 14 games leads the league in playoff scoring. And his 13-game point streak (snapped Saturday night) had only been accomplished previously by Bryan Trottier, Bobby Orr, Mark Messier, and Nathan MacKinnon. 3. In my pre-series predictions at The Cult of Hockey I chose Edmonton in 7 games. Among my reasons were the Oilers special teams. That is an edge for Edmonton in the Conference Finals against the Stars. Of course, any success in that area is predicated on the assumption that the Oilers will get any power plays. There has been a grand-total of 3 for Edmonton over the opening two games. Perhaps Dallas is exercising exceptional restraint. But with my Oilers-shaded lenses off, the Stars were also the least penalized club during the regular season. Kris Knoblauch\u2019s post-game comment after Game 2: \u201cWe would like the same standard\u201d. Amen. 2. I do not blame Kris Knoblauch for running the exact same lineup in Game 2 from the one he deployed in Game 1. But the narrow loss in Game 2 gives him broad license to switch things up at home for Game 3. And unless his health takes a sudden step back, I would put Adam Henrique back in the lineup in a heartbeat. Henrique is a legit Top-6, 2-way performer. He only makes you better. The question becomes: Who do you take out? Derek Ryan, who has been excellent of late but who had a challenging Game 2 (5v5 CF 3-10, 23%). Sam Carrick has been dependable but is a depth player. Warren Foegele was noticeable in Game 2 and had an assist. Now\u2026I have nothing but time for young Ryan McLeod, but he has struggled. 5v5 Scoring Chances were 3-7 on Saturday. And he has been ice-cold in the post-season with the puck. Hmmm. The Stanley Cup Playoffs are littered with difficult decisions.", "summary": "The Oilers are 7 wins away from winning the Stanley Cup. It is imminently do-able. It is merely playing .580 hockey the rest of the way. They were .634 in the regular season. Of course, the main difference from then to now is the quality of competition and that is substantial.

Daniel Popescu, now facing up to 17 years and four months in jail, attempted to murder the mother of his unborn child, Andreea Pintili, in a horrifying street assault near Merthyr Tydfil. Videos from South Wales Police reveal Popescu, disguised in a coat, hood, and backpack, lurking behind a parked car before launching his attack on his ex-partner. A bystander's frantic screams of \"stop\" and \"Oh my God\" prompt her to rush to aid the victim. In the footage, Popescu is seen fleeing the scene, clutching a large knife. Bodycam footage from armed officers also captured Popescu's arrest in a flat, where he surrendered with his hands raised. The 29-year-old, with no fixed address, brutally stabbed the Andreea at least five times on December 5th last year in Coronation Place, Aberfan. Popescu, who pleaded guilty to attempted murder and stalking, faced Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke's stern words during his sentencing at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. \u201cYou were in a relationship for about three years and she ended it in August 2023. You refused to accept her decision\u201d, they said. \u201cYou followed her places, left messages, and repeatedly telephoned her while withholding your number. You were arrested and released on bail, and she moved to Aberfan to avoid you, but you found her and pleaded with her to get back together with you.\" The court heard that Popescu was furious because he believed his ex had reunited with her former partner. In a disturbing message to his sister, he wrote \"w****s must die\" and told another person he intended to harm the Andreea's partner. Judge Lloyd-Clarke stated: \"On December 5, 2023, you travelled to Aberfan, where she was living, you armed yourself with a large knife, and you concealed yourself behind a parked car near her home address and waited for her. As she returned home, having taken her children to school, she heard footsteps behind her and you grabbed her by the arm of her jacket. \"You told her to go in the house. You said you had a knife and you would kill her if she did not do as you said, and you then produced the knife. [She] turned and tried to run away but she fell to the floor. While she was on the floor you stabbed her a number of times. She held her stomach to try to protect her unborn child. She was 37 weeks pregnant with your child. A lady passing by saw what was happening, and screamed and tried to help. You ran away.\" The attack left a Andreea hospitalised with three superficial wounds to her hand and two penetrating wounds to her back, along with a superficial wound. Fortunately, her unborn child was unharmed in the attack. Popescu had no prior convictions, but Judge Lloyd-Clarke noted the calculated nature of the assault. Despite the injuries not being severe, the judge said that the outcome was purely by chance. Popescu stopped his attack only through the intervention of a passer-by. Concerningly, a probation report revealed his lack of remorse and highlighted him as a significant risk to both the victim and potential future partners. In response, Judge Lloyd-Clarke imposed a substantial sentence, comprising a custodial period of up to 17 years and four months, along with a three-year extended licence period. Popescu must serve at least two-thirds of his sentence before any consideration of parole. Additionally, an indefinite restraining order was issued to ensure the victim's ongoing safety. *For confidential support, call the 24-hourNational Domestic Abuse Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit womensaid.co.ukIf you or your family have lost a friend or family member through fatal domestic abuse, AAFDA (Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse)can offer specialist and expert support and advocacy.

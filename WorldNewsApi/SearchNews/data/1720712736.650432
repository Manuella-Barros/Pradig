The former Chelsea boss has held talks with Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe amid uncertainty over Erik ten Hag's future at the club. United are currently reviewing the 2023/24 season as well as Ten Hag's position after finishing eighth in the Premier League, their lowest finish since 1989/90, with a decision on the Dutchman's position expected soon. Despite a hugely disappointing league campaign, May's FA Cup final win over Manchester City has added weight towards keeping the Dutchman in charge, with a decision said to be imminent.

And legendary United midfielder Keane previously heaped praise on the German during his time at Chelsea. Todd Boehly and his American consortium completed their takeover at Stamford Bridge in late May 2022. But the Blues' pre-season that summer under Tuchel was difficult and after a disappointing end to the previous campaign, there were suggestions that the new owners could be looking for a new manager. However, Keane backed the former Borrusia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain boss to turn things around during an interview with Sky Bet in July 2022. \"There has obviously been loads of uncertainty over the club the last few months, that has been sorted out now obviously with the new ownership coming in,\" Keane said at the time. \"I'm pretty sure again he will be able to bring some players in. He is a top-quality manager, he has dealt with a lot of issues over the last few months. \"Ultimately it was a disappointing end to the season for them. But he is a top-quality manager and I think the owners will back him. I'd be amazed if he is not there at Christmas.\" Instead, Tuchel's time in West London came to an end just two months later though when he was sacked in September that year.", "summary": "Former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has been linked with Manchester United as the club reviews Erik ten Hag's position", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/tuchel-man-utd-manager-kean-29109530", "image": "https://i2-prod.coventrytelegraph.net/incoming/article29322595.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2153694511.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:46:35", "author": "Isaac Seelochan", "authors": ["Isaac Seelochan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.473}

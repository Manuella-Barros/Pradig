Decoding a viral social trend on Israel\u2019s war", "text": "An image with the text \u201cAll eyes on Rafah\u201d is on every other Instagram story, dominating social media discourse on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. Here\u2019s more about the trend and the image, which has been re-shared on more than 40 million Instagram stories since Monday, a day after Israel\u2019s deadly offensive on Gaza\u2019s Rafah. What does \u2018All eyes on Rafah\u2019 mean? \u201cAll eyes on Rafah\u201d is an image with a slogan calling attention to the situation in Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip near the border with Egypt. After the beginning of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, Israel began bombing it from the north and moved down, displacing Palestinians from their homes as they fled south to seek shelter. By February, about half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population had been pushed into Rafah when Israel said it planned to launch a ground operation on Rafah, claiming four brigades of Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs the Strip, were there. The announcement was condemned worldwide. In February, Richard \u201cRik\u201d Peeperkorn, WHO representative for Gaza and the occupied West Bank, said \u201call eyes\u201d are on the impending Rafah offensive. It is believed that \u201cAll eyes on Rafah\u201d was picked up from his statement. Since then, the slogan has appeared on protest posters and other social media posts. What\u2019s happening in Rafah? On Sunday, two days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to halt its offensive on Rafah, Israeli bombardment killed at least 45 people in al-Mawasi in western Rafah, which was previously declared a safe zone. Another Israeli strike killed 21 in a displacement camp west of Rafah on Tuesday, at least 12 of those killed were women. Air attacks were reported on Wednesday morning. Israel has killed at least 36,171 people in Gaza since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. What does the \u2018All eyes on Rafah\u2019 image look like? The AI-generated image shows an aerial view of a camp set out in orderly rows of tents, nestled between what look like snowy peaks. In the middle, some lighter-coloured tents are arranged to spell out \u201cAll eyes on Rafah\u201d. A clear blue sky with cotton-ball clouds is in the background. All eyes on #Rafah ?? pic.twitter.com/bg3bAtl3dQ \u2014 The Palestinian (@InsiderWorld_1) May 27, 2024 Rafah looks nothing like that: Its skies are grey with smoke from Israeli bombs and there are no orderly rows of tents \u2013 many are smouldering after being bombed with their occupants still inside, and debris is scattered between them. Rafah is also far more crowded \u2013 with an estimated 1.4 million people seeking refuge there from Israel\u2019s bombs in February, according to the United Nations. Al Jazeera\u2019s Sanad fact-checking agency confirmed that the image was generated using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool. There are tell-tale signs of AI, including repetition, the symmetrical alignment of the tents, the lack of detail, and the absence of shadows.

Here\u2019s what Rafah looked like on Monday: Here\u2019s an image of Rafah from Tuesday: Who has shared the \u2018All eyes on Rafah\u2019 AI-generated image? The image is being reposted on Instagram stories by users globally. As of 11:30 GMT on Wednesday, it has been reposted on 40.4 million Instagram stories.

Al Jazeera could not confirm whether this user created the image. Besides Instagram, the image has also been re-shared on X. Why is \u2018All eyes on Rafah\u2019 so viral? The image has caught more attention than many photos of Rafah, or Gaza. This could be because the image is being shared using Instagram\u2019s \u201cAdd Yours\u201d feature, which allows users to repost it in seconds without having to search for images. It is also an easy way to talk about the war as celebrities and influencers receive more and more criticism over their silence on the war. Some speculate that people are sharing this AI image because it is more palatable than real photos of Gaza, which are graphic and show blood, dead bodies and violence. \u201cI believe the virality of this image is largely due to its stark contrast with the predominant visual imagery of the war\u2026 To humanise the victims in Gaza and Rafah, social media users often share vivid images of casualties and mourning family members,\u201d Eddy Borges-Rey, associate professor in residence at Northwestern University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera. He adds: \u201cThis might explain why algorithms on platforms like Meta [Facebook and Instagram], designed to filter graphic violence, did not flag this image. Unlike real, graphic images of the war, which might be restricted or removed due to content policies, this AI-generated image could spread more freely, contributing to its rapid virality,\u201d said Borges-Rey. How have people reacted to \u2018All eyes on Rafah\u2019? There seem to be as many social media users angered by the post as those who have celebrated it. Those critical of the viral post deem re-sharing it as performative activism that distracts from real images and important updates from Rafah. palestinian journalists have been risking their lives for months to document every single massacre and instead people are reposting an ai-generated \u201cart\u201d that says \u201call eyes on rafah\u201d and tells us nothing about what is actually happening on the ground or gives us any action items \u2014 maryam \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0645???

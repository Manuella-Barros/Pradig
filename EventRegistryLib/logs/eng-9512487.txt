Jeff Landry's effort to gain greater control over state taxes and spending by rewriting the state constitution won approval Wednesday in the first step of the legislative process.\n\nOn a party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House and Governmental Affairs Committee passed House Bill 800, which calls for convening a two-week convention next month to rewrite the constitution. HB 800 advances to the full House for consideration sometime soon.\n\nIf it receives the necessary two-thirds vote there, it would advance to the Senate, which has not shown much enthusiasm yet for the idea.\n\nLandry is stepping up pressure on lawmakers to convene the convention, pitching it on talk radio shows on Monday and Tuesday and planning to promote it Thursday at what will be only his second press conference in Baton Rouge since he became governor in January.\n\nSo far, Landry is not saying exactly how he wants delegates to redo the constitution if they begin meeting on May 20, as called for under HB 800. The constitutional convention would take place concurrently during the final two weeks of the regular session.\n\nBaton Rouge talk show host Jim Engster asked Landry on Tuesday whether he favors removing from the constitution the $75,000 homestead exemption or the MFP funding formula for K-12 schools. The governor did not say.\n\nLandry did say he wants a freer hand in tax and budget policy next year when the state is facing a projected $530 million deficit, unless lawmakers renew a .45-cent sales tax that expires in mid-2025.\n\n\"If you're going to overhaul the tax code, you have to get some of the things in the constitution out of the way so that you can lay them on the table and have an open and honest conversation about those,\" Landry said on the radio. \"Next year, if we don't clean up the constitution when we have a half billion deficit, the only places we're going to be able to take money from is health care and education...I'd rather have the legislature in a position under which the legislature can look around and spread that pain throughout the budget process.\"\n\nOn other occasions, Landry has complained about the length of Louisiana's constitution, one of the country's longest, saying the state should have a streamlined document so policymakers have a freer hand to make changes.\n\nThe convention would have 171 delegates: all 139 legislators and 27 delegates appointed by Landry.\n\nRep. Beau Beaullieu, the committee chair and sponsor of the legislation, said on Wednesday that the plan is to take protected programs out of the constitution and put them in statute so that legislators can modify them.\n\n\"We have a new governor who wants to make bold changes in Louisiana,\" Beaullieu said.\n\nRepresentatives of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, Associated Contractors and Builders of Louisiana and the Pelican Institute for Public Policy all spoke in favor of the bill.\n\nBeaullieu faced plenty of pushback from Democrats and several dozen members of the public who put in red cards to express their opposition.\n\nRep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, complained about a rushed process and a lack of transparency, even as she said Louisiana needs a new constitution to replace the one adopted by voters in 1974.\n\nRep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, said Landry and the Republican majority ought to take their ideas for changing the constitution on a road show throughout the state to fully engage the public and then call a convention on March 1.\n\n\"We're not privileged to what the transition team is intending to do,\" said Rep. Denise Marcelle, D-Baton Rouge.\n\nShe was referring to Landry's transition team, which appears to be formulating the specific ideas to be included in the proposed constitutional convention.\n\nThe governor's office has declined to provide a list of the transition team's members.\n\nThree former House members served as its co-chairs: Jim Tucker, Loulan Pitre and Neil Abramson. All three, who would be delegates appointed by Landry, spoke in favor of the bill last week and said in interviews that they are not receiving pay for their work.\n\nOn Wednesday, Abramson appeared alone and defended the plan.\n\nA New Orleans lawyer and lobbyist, Abramson repeatedly told the committee members that he and others want to limit a constitutional convention to items that would be removed from the constitution, that they don't want to change existing language in the document.\n\nHe told Newell that he's been engaged in \"a collaborative effort.\"\n\nAbramson declined to be interviewed afterward.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_bridges@theadvocate.com", "name": "Tyler Bridges", "type":

Jeff Landry that calls for a limited constitutional convention next month.\n\nHouse Bill 800, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, calls for a constitutional convention to take place from May 20 to June 3, and it could be extended until no later than July 15. The bill now goes to the House floor, where Republicans hold a solid majority and are likely to pass it.\n\nThe convention's delegates would be the members of the state House and the state Senate and 27 people appointed by Landry.\n\nThe committee amended the bill to address concerns expressed in hearings last week. Under the amended bill, judges appointed as delegates by Landry would not have to recuse themselves from their judicial work.\n\nLandry would also not be able to appoint himself as a delegate, and state Atty. Gen. Liz Murrill or her designee would serve as a legal advisor to the convention.\n\nThe amendment also prohibits delegates from impacting Articles 1-4 of the Louisiana Constitution, which are deal with declaration of rights, distribution of powers, the legislative branch and executive branch.\n\nDespite the attempt to address concerns, some members of the committee and the public still took issue Wednesday with the bill due to the timeline and lack of public participation.\n\n\"How could we possibly, in four or five weeks, figure out what we want to move where and be able to really digest the effects of moving something protected by the constitution to something that will have loose protections in a super statute,\" Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, said.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Neil Abramson, who was a part of Landry's transition team on constitutional reform, defended the timeline and explained that each article of the constitution would be assigned to a certain legislative committee. It would examine that article and decide what would stay in the constitution and what would be transitioned into statute.\n\n\"We have already covered Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 through this committee's work,\" Abramson said. \"The idea of the process would be the same for the other committees that we would take a little bit of their time during one of their normal committee meetings, but it would not be disruptive of the rest of your work where you couldn't get to the rest of it, which I don't think we've done for this committee.\"\n\nLawmakers also raised concerns that citizens do not understand what a constitutional convention is or were not given enough notice to express their opinion on the possibility of a convention.\n\n\"I'm finding that some of the public has no idea what that means, even that language, because we're not saying 'constitutional reform,' we're saying 'convention,'\" Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, said.\n\nBeaullieu argued that the timing of the convention is \"perfect\" because of the upcoming fall elections. He believes there would be less public input if the convention was pushed back to the next session. In that case, he said, there would have to be a special election, which would result in a lower voter turnout.\n\n\"We've had a lot of testimony,\" Beaullieu said. \"We're going to continue to have that voice, and that's why we've established the procedure for going through this committee structure to continue to give the people of Louisiana a voice and receive this public input.\"\n\nBeauilleau also discussed the financial effect the convention would have as the .45 cents of the state sales tax is due to expire in spring of 2025.\n\n\"Next year we have a fiscal cliff that we're hitting,\" Beaullieu said. \"$500 million is what it's looking like if we proceed as it is without this convention, and we don't give ourselves the ability to do a comprehensive tax reform. If we don't address something, it's coming out of higher ed, health care, it's that simple.\"\n\nAll nine committee Republicans who were present voted in favor of advancing the bill to the House floor.

(BRPROUD) - Governor Jeff Landry is pushing to make reforms to the state constitution. Some legislators and advocates are concerned that those reforms will lead to sweeping changes and there is not a lot of insight into what all is to be altered.\n\nThe state constitution has not been rewritten since 1974. Since then, hundreds of constitutional amendments have been tacked onto the now bloated document. Landry is not looking to rewrite the constitution, but rather move parts of it into statute to make it easier for the legislature to make changes without asking the voters to approve amendments.\n\n\"It's not really so much what I want, it is what they believe they need to help address some of the budget shortfalls and to do the tax reforms and to clean things up for the state,\" Landry said.\n\nHB800 lays out the groundwork of how the convention will work. The 105 members of the state House and 29 members of the state Senate will serve as delegates. The governor gets to appoint 27 delegates. Each group has to agree on the changes to the constitution in order to make it on the fall ballot where the voters will ultimately give the up or down on the changes.\n\nThe legislature has been pushed to wrap up the majority of their work, including the operating budget, before May 20 for the constitutional convention to gavel in. It would last until June 3, about two weeks. Landry said the reason behind not waiting to do the convention later in his administration is that he wants it on the same ballot as the presidential race, which often brings out higher voter turnout.\n\n\"The timing, unfortunately, is rushed because we want the most people in this state to have a say in the work that they do,\" Landry said. \"The process allows us to ensure that some of the sacrosanct things that the people of this state want and demand in our Constitution remain in their constitution.\"\n\nSome lawmakers and advocates have shared concerns about the speed at which the convention is being put together and the short window to get their work done.\n\n\"Constitutional Convention, yes. Is needed in this short time frame without having all of these concerns that I and other representatives have -that's a big concern for me,\" said state Rep. Candance Newell, D-New Orleans.\n\nThere were multiple hearings in the House and Governmental Affairs to hear public testimony and for legislators to ask questions about the process. There have only been broad ideas shared on what the plan is for the changes. State Rep. Beau Beaullieu said the administration wants to see some of the constitution put into statute - meaning the legislature will more easily be able to make changes without having to change things through amendments.\n\nOne example of a change is that the state is facing a $500-million shortfall in the budget next year when the temporary half-cent sales tax rolls off. Lawmakers can only make cuts to higher education and healthcare to fill those gaps. They want to change it so there would be more pots of money to pull from.\n\nIn past constitutional conventions, the legislators were not the delegates voting on the changes. People from their districts were elected by the public. Some lawmakers are pushing for elected delegates.\n\nState Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, brought up a part of the bill that allows for outside money to fund the convention. He feels this will lead to outside special interests to have sway over the policy decisions of the convention.\n\n\"What scares me is that we're going to bring in private dollars and private dollars or can control the whole operation,\" Larvadain said.\n\nAn amendment was added to the bill stating the chairman of the House and Governmental Affairs committee does not intend to alter articles 1-4 of the state constitution that largely are declarations of rights. It does not guarantee those articles will not be changed in the convention.\n\nThere have been questions over if enough legislators, especially on the Senate side, will be in agreement to hold a convention this year.\n\nThe bill setting up the framework for this constitutional convention now heads to the full House. It will also need to be approved by a Senate committee and the full chamber before it is fully approved and even farther to go before the proposed changes are on the ballot for voters.", "source": {"uri": "brproud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BRPROUD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shannon_heckt@brproud.com", "name": "Shannon Heckt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constituent assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Convention (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Beaullieu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beau Beaullieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Larvadain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Larvadain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional convention (political custom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.brproud.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2024/04/governor-jeff-landry.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512487", "eventUri": "eng-9512487", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1293, "textEnd": 1299}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1367, "textEnd": 1373}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Jeff Landry is implementing a full-court press on lawmakers to approve a convention to rewrite the state Constitution, amplifying the priority from his bully pulpit on every platform.\n\nThe new Republican governor elevated his public campaign to convene a convention in May with a press conference Thursday morning. A political action committee that supports Landry has also launched a video campaign promoting the convention.\n\n\"This is about giving the Legislature the tools to address the problems we know are coming and the opportunity to make changes the people of state are demanding and waiting for,\" Landry said during his press conference, describing the goal as \"reorganizing\" rather than \"rewriting\" the Constitution.\n\n\"It will make Louisiana competitive,\" he said.\n\nLandry and supporters of the convention note the Constitution, which was ratified in 1974, is considered bloated and unwieldy by most good government groups like the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana. It has been amended a staggering 216 times.\n\nMuch of the debate is expected to center on what constitutionally protected funds should be removed, which supporters say would allow for better and more flexible budgeting.\n\nHouse Bill 800, the measure by Republican Rep. Beau Beaullieu to trigger what he called a \"limited\" convention, cleared its first hurdle Wednesday when it advanced from the House Governmental Affairs Committee on a 9-5 vote along party lines with all Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed.\n\nIt must get two-thirds approval by both the full House and later the Senate, where the bill is expected to meet more resistance.\n\nBeaullieu's bill would limit the convention to removal of items from the existing Constitution rather than making additions, which he said may mean delegates could complete their work in a shorter time frame that the two-month window.\n\n\"We're not adding new provisions; we're deciding what provisions can move moved to statute,\" Beaullieu said in an interview with USA Today Network. \"It's an exciting opportunity for Louisiana.\"\n\nBut skeptics like Democrat Rep. Ed Larvadain expressed concerns about the lack of details on what might be removed from the Constitution - from the $75,000 homestead exemption to the MFP funding formula for K-12 schools - and that private funds would be allowed to finance the convention.\n\n\"The whole document scares the hell out of me,\" Larvadain said Wednesday during debate on House Bill 800.\n\nBeaullieu's bill calls for a convention with 171 delegates, including all 144 state legislators and 27 appointed by Landry.\n\nIt would begin May 20 with a July 15 finishing deadline, but could end earlier if delegates agree on a document before then.\n\nThe convention would run concurrently with the ongoing legislative Regular Session, which must end by June 3. Convention business would take place in the House chamber.\n\nIf lawmakers pass the bill and the delegates approve a document from the convention, Beaullieu said the goal is to present a new Constitution to voters on next fall's Nov. 5 presidential ballot. Once it reaches voters, approval of a new Constitution would only require a majority vote of the people.\n\nLandry said it's important for the finished product to be on the ballot during the presidential election because that's when the most people vote.\n\n\"To me if you're going to make changes don't you believe it should be when most people can have a say?\" Landry said.\n\nMore:

Jeff Landry's request a bill that would broaden his authority over state board and commissions appointments, part of the governor's sweeping efforts to consolidate power since he took office in January.\n\nLandry, a Republican, lobbied the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday morning to pass Senate Bill 462 by Sen. Valarie Hodges, R-Denham Springs. The bill would give Landry's office far more authority over the board appointment process than previous governors by allowing him to appoint the chairs and officers of all state boards.\n\nUnder the current system, the governor gets to appoint members on some key boards only over several years, a setup aimed at preventing wholesale reverses in policy after one governor replaces another.\n\nLandry argued that that system doesn't allow newly elected governors to enact their political and policy priorities swiftly enough.\n\n\"Critics of this bill (say) it injects politics into the process,\" Landry said. \"By allowing these boards to elect their own chair, they play their own politics.... This allows the governor to ensure that the politics of the board align with the politics of the governor.\"\n\nAfter his testimony, the committee approved the bill, sending it to the full Senate.\n\nSince his Democratic predecessor, John Bel Edwards, vacated the governor's office in January, Landry has moved faster to consolidate power, buck scrutiny and enact his policy priorities across government than any governor in decades. Hodges' bill is one in a slate of measures moving through the state Capitol in the ongoing legislative session that would help Landry achieve those goals.\n\nAfter Landry's testimony, the Senate and Government Affairs panel was slated to take up another bill that would grant Landry and the Legislature more say in who serves on the state Ethics Board, which has rapped him in the past.\n\nOther bills filed this session would grant Landry more say in who serves on the state civil service commission and shield his office -- among a slew of other government agencies -- from the state's public records law.\n\nLandry has said he supports the public records measure but has not taken a position on the other bills.\n\nPrior to Wednesday, he had come to the Legislature to testify in support of legislation only once: Landry last month sided against insurers by supporting House Bill 315, which lengthens the statute of limitations for filing personal injury and property damage suits.\n\nBefore the vote on the boards and commissions bill Wednesday, state Sen. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, briefly questioned Landry at the mic, saying the bill's purpose seemed unclear.\n\nLandry replied that the bill is about a \"bigger picture\" than just his governorship.\n\n\"There are some boards and commissions under which the governor would have to spend two terms before he or she would be able to implement the policies that the people elected him or her to do,\" he said. \"That's unfair to that governor. ... That's unfair to the people who supported that particular governor.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

Jeff Landry that calls for a limited constitutional convention next month.\n\nHouse Bill 800, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, calls for a constitutional convention to take place from May 20 to June 3, and it could be extended until no later than July 15. The bill now goes to the House floor, where Republicans hold a solid majority and are likely to pass it.\n\nThe convention's delegates would be the members of the state House and the state Senate and 27 people appointed by Landry.\n\nThe committee amended the bill to address concerns expressed in hearings last week. Under the amended bill, judges appointed as delegates by Landry would not have to recuse themselves from their judicial work.\n\nLandry would also not be able to appoint himself as a delegate, and state Atty. Gen. Liz Murrill or her designee would serve as a legal advisor to the convention.\n\nThe amendment also prohibits delegates from impacting Articles 1-4 of the Louisiana Constitution, which are deal with declaration of rights, distribution of powers, the legislative branch and executive branch.\n\nDespite the attempt to address concerns, some members of the committee and the public still took issue Wednesday with the bill due to the timeline and lack of public participation.\n\n\"How could we possibly, in four or five weeks, figure out what we want to move where and be able to really digest the effects of moving something protected by the constitution to something that will have loose protections in a super statute,\" Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, said.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Neil Abramson, who was a part of Landry's transition team on constitutional reform, defended the timeline and explained that each article of the constitution would be assigned to a certain legislative committee. It would examine that article and decide what would stay in the constitution and what would be transitioned into statute.\n\n\"We have already covered Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 through this committee's work,\" Abramson said. \"The idea of the process would be the same for the other committees that we would take a little bit of their time during one of their normal committee meetings, but it would not be disruptive of the rest of your work where you couldn't get to the rest of it, which I don't think we've done for this committee.\"\n\nLawmakers also raised concerns that citizens do not understand what a constitutional convention is or were not given enough notice to express their opinion on the possibility of a convention.\n\n\"I'm finding that some of the public has no idea what that means, even that language, because we're not saying 'constitutional reform,' we're saying 'convention,'\" Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, said. \"Most of the public have no idea what that really means. So then when it is on the ballot, they probably will have no idea what they're even supposed to be voting on.\"\n\nBeaullieu argued that the timing of the convention is \"perfect\" because of the upcoming fall elections. He believes there would be less public input if the convention was pushed back to the next session. In that case, he said, there would have to be a special election, which would result in a lower voter turnout.\n\n\"We've had a lot of testimony,\" Beaullieu said. \"We're going to continue to have that voice, and that's why we've established the procedure for going through this committee structure to continue to give the people of Louisiana a voice and receive this public input.\"\n\nBeauilleau also discussed the financial effect the convention would have as the .45 cents of the state sales tax is due to expire in spring of 2025.\n\n\"Next year we have a fiscal cliff that we're hitting,\" Beaullieu said. \"$500 million is what it's looking like if we proceed as it is without this convention, and we don't give ourselves the ability to do a comprehensive tax reform. If we don't address something, it's coming out of higher ed, health care, it's that simple.\"\n\nAll nine committee Republicans who were present voted in favor of advancing the bill to the House floor. All five Democrats present voted against the bill.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_white@ktbs.com", "name": "Elizabeth White",

Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, is carrying legislation that sets up the framework for a constitutional convention. (Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)\n\nGov. Jeff Landry will discuss his push for a constitutional convention with reporters Thursday morning as the proposal to pull together lawmakers and his appointed delegates for a thorough update of the foundational document for state government advances in the Legislature.\n\nThe Landry administration's point man for an update to the Louisiana Constitution used words such as \"restructure\" and \"reorganize\" -- instead of \"rewrite\" -- to explain the governor's intentions Wednesday to a legislative committee. Even though the phraseology brought little comfort to Democrats on the panel, the legislation that sets up the framework for a constitutional convention advanced with Republican support.\n\nThe House and Governmental Affair Committee capped three days of public hearings with a 9-5 party line vote to send House Bill 800 to the House floor.\n\nIts sponsor, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, brushed off concerns from colleagues who question the Legislature's ability to proceed with their ongoing lawmaking session and simultaneously handle constitutional revisions.\n\n\"I would argue that the timing is perfect and the timing is absolute if we're going to make bold changes in Louisiana,\" Beaullieu told the committee.\n\nHis bill calls for the convention to begin May 20 and ideally end by June 3, which is when lawmakers have to end their session. If their work on the constitution isn't complete, lawmakers can extend that deadline to July 15 at the latest. The mid-July date is essential so any constitutional changes can be placed before voters on the November ballot.\n\nSenate President Cameron Henry has said his chamber does not intend to work on the constitution past June 3.\n\nIn addition to 105 House members and 39 state senators, Landry will appoint 27 delegates to the constitutional convention. They include Neil Abramson, a Democrat from New Orleans who repeatedly filed legislation to update the constitution when he was in the Louisiana House from 2009 to 2018. Even bills that focused only on small sections of the document failed to gain approval from lawmakers.\n\nAbramson presented Beaullieu's bill Wednesday to the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, where he said the proposal's intent is \"not to change a word\" but restructure the state charter. He labeled discussions over possible changes to the state homestead exemption and Minimum Foundation Program \"scare tactics\" meant to derail the convention.\n\nLouisiana's most recent rewrite of its constitution in 1974 included the homestead exemption, which drops the first $7,500 from the assessed value of a primary residence for property tax purposes.\n\nThe Minimum Foundation Program was added to the constitution in 1987. It established a per-student formula for distributing state money to K-12 schools. If it's pulled from the constitution and turned into a regular state statute, some fear the Legislature could depart from a fair method of funding public schools.\n\nAbramson said convention participants will have the option to place provisions into a \"super statute\" that would require a higher threshold for lawmakers to change, versus the more -consuming process for a statewide vote that constitutional amendments require.\n\nBeaullieu amended his bill Wednesday to eliminate a provision that would have allowed the governor to fill in for any of his appointed delegates who couldn't take part in the convention for health reasons. Instead, the governor can pick a replacement delegate.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nDespite Abramson's assurances, the committee's Democrats argued Landry's hasty call for a constitutional convention severely limits the public's opportunity for input. Rep. Denise Marcelle, D-Baton Rouge, said she's troubled with the language in Beaullieu's bill that allows contributions from private sources to help fund the convention. The same sources could also play a role in determining the outcome of any constitutional proposal on the fall ballot, she added.\n\n\"You and I have both been in politics long enough to know who has the money to spend can probably change, sway, put it on there in a way people don't quite understand all of it, and they're going to vote for it if that's where the money's being spent,\" Marcelle said.\n\nAbramson and Beaullieu said a predicted $500 million state revenue dip and the lack of a statewide election in 2025 require the constitutional update to happen now. Both insisted lawmakers could balance the demands of the legislative session with the added duties of a convention.\n\nThe first four articles of the Louisiana Constitution would be left intact, Abramson said. They cover the declaration of citizens' rights, the distribution of powers within state government and executive and legislative branches.\n\nAll other subject matter, starting with Article V on the judiciary, would be assigned to applicable legislative committees to decide what stays in the constitution, what's eliminated and what's put into state statute, according to Abramson.\n\nSome lawmakers have questioned whether all 177 delegates to the constitution would carry the same weight, with the power of 39 senators considered equal to 105 representatives and the governor's 27 appointees.\n\nAbramson said the Senate, House and delegates would each vote separately on all constitutional proposals, with approval needed from all three in order to put the changes before voters. He did not detail how any disagreements among the three groups would be settled.\n\nThose in favor of holding the constitutional convention as soon as possible appeared before the committee to urge passage of the Beaullieu bill. They included leaders from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI), the conservative Pelican Institute and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Louisiana.\n\n\"I do believe that the people will be very much informing you as you go along through your deliberations, as a constitutional convention, as to what it is that they are concerned about ... what it is that they want to see addressed,\" LABI president Jim Patterson told lawmakers.\n\nAlfreda Tillman Bester, general counsel for the NAACP's Louisiana State Conference, urged the committee to slow down the process.\n\n\"What's the rush? We've been talking about this for 22 years, and now all of a sudden we have to do it in two weeks?\" Bester said. \"We can do better, Louisiana.\"\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\nDONATE\n\nThe post

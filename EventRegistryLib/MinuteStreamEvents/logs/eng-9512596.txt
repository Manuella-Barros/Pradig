While Aussie viewers have already enjoyed the explosive MAFS 2024 season finale, it has yet to air for UK audiences, and we can watch their final vows tonight and see if they decide to stay together or not.\n\nBut thanks to Australian news sites and social media, we can get ahead of the show and see where the couple are now. So if you want to know what's in store for Jayden and Eden, we can tell you what the pair have been up to post-filming. Spoiler alert below.\n\nEden and Jayden are making their final vows tonight - but will they stay together?\n\nThe couple started strong, and despite being one of the youngest in the experiment, they were pretty excited to get married. Things got rocky when Jayden made a bombshell admission during Confessions Week - telling his new wife that he once got revenge on a cheating ex by sleeping with her best friend while she watched. This was \"triggering\" for Eden, who has been cheated on before, but Jayden insisted he didn't regret it.\n\nThings improved for the couple and they went from strength to strength, writing 'stay' at every commitment ceremony and looking like a united front at every dinner party. However, the pressure seemed to get too much for Eden, as she told her husband Jayden she couldn't \"do it anymore\" in an emotional rant on episode 33 (Thursday 18) which saw a decline in the couple's love story.\n\nEden has been struggling to cope with the pressures of the show and we saw her deliver an ultimatum to Jayden, 26, amid the drama with fellow bride Sara.\n\nDespite this wobble, things appear to take a more positive turn right at the end of the series, as the couple reportedly express their love for each other at the final dinner party and exchange sweet words during their final vows (airing in the UK this week). But it has since been revealed that the couple's fairytale sadly came to an end eight months after filming.\n\nIn a heartbreaking announcement on Instagram, Eden Harper told fans she and her TV husband Jayden Eynaud have parted ways. The gutted bride, 28, simply said he \"didn't choose me\" after being together for eight months since filming for the show ended. In a recent interview with Daily Mail., the Eden revealed she was \"blindsided\" by the dumping, that left her \"bewildered\" and said she's unable to reach Jayden and said he isn't responding to her messages.\n\nIn her post that announced the breakup, Eden wrote: I'm saddened to share that toward the end of the show airing, our relationship came to an end. The reality is, the person I chose, didn't choose me. I'm saddened to share that toward the end of the show airing, our relationship came to an end. The reality is, the person I chose, didn't choose me. Whilst I'm disappointed that what you saw didn't translate in the real world, I will never regret this experiment, the people I met, the lessons I learnt and the growth it has had on me.\"\n\nShe then thanked fans for their support, and Jayden then released a similar post. He wrote: \"Sometimes in life, things don't always go the way you had hoped for. After the experiment, Eden and I went back to the Gold Coast and continued to enjoy living our lives together and getting to know each other every day.\n\n\"However, unfortunately, our relationship ended not long before the end of the experiment airing. As sad as it is, I'm so glad I got to go through this with such an amazing woman and a beautiful son,\" followed by a dog emoji. His post finished off: \"You will both always have a second family on the Gold Coast.\"\n\nAccording to a source close to Eden, as reported by Daily Mail Australia, the couple's breakup came \"completely out of the blue\" for Eden and she is \"pretty shattered about it\". The source added: \"Eden was in the dark about the whole thing and still doesn't know how Jayden feels about her. Jayden didn't really give her any real reason for breaking up with her. She tried her best to try and get things to work out and fix whatever issues he had but he wasn't willing to play game.\"\n\nEden admitted she was \"confused\" by Jayden's heartfelt breakup announcement post and said: 'I thought his announcement was nice in that he wrote similarly to how I did, but yeah, I was a little bit confused by him saying that I had family with him because he doesn't reply to me.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share?

I worry about not being good enough for you and not being able to fulfil your needs and expectations as a partner. This decision is not one that I have taken lately. We are both good people and we both deserve a loving relationship.\"\n\nWhile Eden looked nervous, she took a sigh of relief as Jayden then said: \"Eden, the feeling I have for you I have never felt in my life. There is nobody else I want to be with.\" On a lighter note, Jayden then playfully added: \"Although you constantly steal my hairbrush, use all my expensive shampoo, leave water all over the house after showering and get makeup all over my towels, I wouldn't change it for anything because I truly love you with all my heart.\"\n\nHe then declared that he could see himself \"spending the rest of our lives together\" and said she would be a great mother, whether that was with \"baby humans or golden retrievers\". Eden then admitted Jayden \"couldn't be any more my type\" and claimed he \"melted her\" when she first saw him. She then brought up their struggles but praised her husband for his support. She said: \"Our relationship grew stronger with every challenge. In our way, we built trust and respect for one another we supported one another.\"\n\nShe then sobbed as she said: \"I now step out of this experiment knowing exactly what I want from a partner and that is you. I can't thank you enough for the love affection and kindness that you showed me. I hope I get to experience it for a lifetime. I can't wait to bring a relationship to everyday life so I can tell you that I love you every single day.\"\n\nJayden then gave Eden a glistening bracelet to seal their love and the couple said they were looking forward to their future and said they had gotten their \"happily ever after\".\n\nThe heartfelt words were loved by fans, as one viewer shared on X: \"Jaden is so damn sweet He just needs to be a little less domineering towards Eden,\" while a second said: \"Eden, bless her. Jayden assuring her was nice to see. They're cute, I hope they make it. Personally, I'm not convinced it will last in the long run aaaaah but I hope they'll last. They're sweet though.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share?

So tacky. He's the biggest tight***.\"\n\nHowever the insider went on to state that Eden, \"wanted to keep it so she didn't sell it\", with Jayden later claiming that the whole thing was a prank.\n\nThe source disclosed: \"She told him it was her bracelet and Jayden was really p***** about it. He later said it was just a joke and she could keep it, but it was still a weird thing to say.\"\n\nThis revelation comes after the couple shocked fans by announcing they had parted ways, just days after the reunion episode.\n\nTaking to Instagram, Eden released a statement regarding their split, writing: \"When I made the decision at final vows to be with Jayden, I really did that with longterm intentions. Jayden & I spent many months together after the experiment, during which Cub gained a dad and I gained a second family who I'm truly grateful for.\n\n\"I'm saddened to share that toward the end of the show airing, our relationship came to an unexpected end. The 'reality' is, the person I chose didn't choose me. Whilst I'm disappointed, I will never regret the experiment, the people I met, the lessons I learnt and the growth this process has had on me.\n\n\"Thank you for supporting us and for also wishing for the same fairytale that I had hoped for.\"\n\nWatch Jayden and Eden's final vows on MAFS Australia here:\n\nThe MAFS bride later came out to discuss how her break up with Jayden went down, telling Daily Mail Australia that she was left \"blindsided\" by the split.\n\nEden said: \"Everything was good. I do think in any relationship, there's ups and downs, but it came completely out of the blue for me. It was definitely a blind side.\n\n\"I just felt that the way that it all fell apart for us when he broke up with me, I just felt he was choosing not to be with me, and he didn't want to be with me.\"\n\nWhilst Jayden hasn't commented on the accusations that he tried to sell the bracelet, he did speak out on his break up from Eden, writing: \"Sometimes in life, things don't always go the way you had hoped for. After the experiment, Eden and I went back to the Gold Coast and continued to enjoy living our lives together and getting to know each other every day.\n\n\"However, unfortunately, our relationship ended not long before the end of the experiment airing.

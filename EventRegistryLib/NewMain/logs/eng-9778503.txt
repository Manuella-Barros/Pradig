Because I have three other cats, it is not realistic for me to monitor all his food intake. It would be perfect if there were a feeding system that excludes one cat, but I have not seen any of those. Have you? He does not vomit wet food. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- Liz Perry, Hampton, Virginia\n\nDear Liz,\n\nAn automatic feeder for each cat would allow you to regulate feeding habits, portion control, and type of food. These feeders are equipped with technology that recognizes individual cats via a tag on their collar or their microchip. Each cat's tag or microchip is programmed into the feeder, ensuring it only opens for the designated cat. This recognition system allows you to customize feeding schedules and portions for each cat.\n\nFor instance, if one cat requires a special diet or has different feeding needs, the feeder will dispense the appropriate food only for that cat. Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help. Let me know how it works out.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nWe have a one-year-old Cocker Spaniel who jumps in our bed every morning between 4 and 5 a.m. We tell her to get down, but a half hour later, she jumps up again. Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment. With patience, love, and the right environment, your furry friend can become a confident and affectionate companion. Don't give up -- your efforts will be rewarded.\n\n_____\n\n_____\n\n(Cathy M.

Have you? He does not vomit wet food. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- Liz Perry, Hampton, Virginia\n\nDear Liz,\n\nAn automatic feeder for each cat would allow you to regulate feeding habits, portion control, and type of food. These feeders are equipped with technology that recognizes individual cats via a tag on their collar or their microchip. Each cat's tag or microchip is programmed into the feeder, ensuring it only opens for the designated cat. This recognition system allows you to customize feeding schedules and portions for each cat.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help. Let me know how it works out.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nWe have a one-year-old Cocker Spaniel who jumps in our bed every morning between 4 and 5 a.m. We tell her to get down, but a half hour later, she jumps up again. Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment. With patience, love, and the right environment, your furry friend can become a confident and affectionate companion. Don't give up -- your efforts will be rewarded.\n\n_____\n\n_____\n\n(Cathy M.

Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment.

Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help.

Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment. With patience, love, and the right environment, your furry friend can become a confident and affectionate companion. Don't give up -- your efforts will be rewarded.\n\n_____\n\n_____\n\n(Cathy M.

Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help.

Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment. With patience, love, and the right environment, your furry friend can become a confident and affectionate companion. Don't give up -- your efforts will be rewarded.\n\n_____\n\n_____\n\n(Cathy M.

Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help. Let me know how it works out.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nWe have a one-year-old Cocker Spaniel who jumps in our bed every morning between 4 and 5 a.m. We tell her to get down, but a half hour later, she jumps up again. Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment. With patience, love, and the right environment, your furry friend can become a confident and affectionate companion. Don't give up -- your efforts will be rewarded.\n\n_____\n\n_____\n\n(Cathy M.

Rosenthal.\n\nCathy M. Rosenthal, Tribune Content Agency\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nI have a large, neutered male cat who is a master of the scarf and barf. He eats so quickly that soon afterward, the projectile vomits. I have tried food for sensitive stomachs, but it hasn't helped. Because I have three other cats, it is not realistic for me to monitor all his food intake. It would be perfect if there were a feeding system that excludes one cat, but I have not seen any of those. Have you? He does not vomit wet food. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- Liz Perry, Hampton, Virginia\n\nDear Liz,\n\nAn automatic feeder for each cat would allow you to regulate feeding habits, portion control, and type of food. These feeders are equipped with technology that recognizes individual cats via a tag on their collar or their microchip. Each cat's tag or microchip is programmed into the feeder, ensuring it only opens for the designated cat. This recognition system allows you to customize feeding schedules and portions for each cat.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help. Let me know how it works out.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nWe have a one-year-old Cocker Spaniel who jumps in our bed every morning between 4 and 5 a.m. We tell her to get down, but a half hour later, she jumps up again. Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\n-- Elaine, Franklin Square, New York\n\nDear Elaine,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment.

He eats so quickly that soon afterward, the projectile vomits. I have tried food for sensitive stomachs, but it hasn't helped. Because I have three other cats, it is not realistic for me to monitor all his food intake. It would be perfect if there were a feeding system that excludes one cat, but I have not seen any of those. Have you? He does not vomit wet food. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n-- Liz Perry, Hampton, Virginia\n\nDear Liz,\n\nAn automatic feeder for each cat would allow you to regulate feeding habits, portion control, and type of food. These feeders are equipped with technology that recognizes individual cats via a tag on their collar or their microchip. Each cat's tag or microchip is programmed into the feeder, ensuring it only opens for the designated cat.

Napa officials, nonprofits seem cautious\n\nFor instance, if one cat requires a special diet or has different feeding needs, the feeder will dispense the appropriate food only for that cat. Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help.

Any suggestions?\n\n-- Larry, Norfolk, Virginia\n\nDear Larry,\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around.

Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding.

He eats so quickly that soon afterward, the projectile vomits. I have tried food for sensitive stomachs, but it hasn't helped. Because I have three other cats, it is not realistic for me to monitor all his food intake. It would be perfect if there were a feeding system that excludes one cat, but I have not seen any of those. Have you? He does not vomit wet food. Do you have any suggestions?\n\nAn automatic feeder for each cat would allow you to regulate feeding habits, portion control, and type of food. These feeders are equipped with technology that recognizes individual cats via a tag on their collar or their microchip. Each cat's tag or microchip is programmed into the feeder, ensuring it only opens for the designated cat. This recognition system allows you to customize feeding schedules and portions for each cat.\n\nFor instance, if one cat requires a special diet or has different feeding needs, the feeder will dispense the appropriate food only for that cat. Setting up multiple feeders allows you to provide different foods for each cat based on their dietary needs and without them accessing each other's food.\n\nI know these devices can be expensive, and buying four might be prohibitive for you, but it's really the best investment when you have multiple pets since diets and portions are not always the same for each one. This way, you can feed your large male wet food instead of dry since the latter seems to trigger the vomiting.\n\nIf the cost is prohibitive, feed everyone the same diet. Food allergies could also be a culprit, so feeding everyone the same food might be a necessary compromise.\n\nI also recommend taking him to the vet to rule out health problems. It doesn't sound like vomiting is related to hairballs, but adding hairball medicine or switching to hairball cat food might also help. Let me know how it works out.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nWe have a one-year-old Cocker Spaniel who jumps in our bed every morning between 4 and 5 a.m. We tell her to get down, but a half hour later, she jumps up again. Our four-year-old cockapoo waits until the alarm clock goes off. Any suggestions?\n\nJust like babies who wake up early, it sounds like your young Cocker Spaniel is ready to start her day. There are several things you can try.\n\nGradually train her to wait for the alarm clock, similar to your Cockapoo, using positive reinforcement when she gets off the bed or stays off the bed until the alarm goes off. Continue to use the \"down\" command, as consistency is key in training, and reward her with treats when she does.\n\nProvide a comfortable alternative sleeping area for her in your bedroom, such as a dog bed, and encourage her to use it with treats and praise.\n\nConsider crate training her at night to provide a safe and comfortable space and prevent her from coming into your room so early.\n\nEnsure she gets plenty of exercise during the day, as a tired dog is more likely to sleep through the night. Talk her for walks during the day, and establish a calming bedtime routine, including a short walk, some quiet play, or a relaxing petting session before bed.\n\nWith time and training, she should learn to respect your boundaries.\n\nDear Cathy,\n\nBack in April, I wrote to you about my scared and skittish new six-year-old cat named Tucker, and in the column, \"Tips for bringing out the best in your skittish cat,\" you offered several suggestions on how to help him adapt to his new home. I'm so happy to report that Tucker has become a total love bug. It just shows that love is better the second time around. The outcome was well worth the effort.\n\nI'm thrilled to hear that Tucker has become such a love bug! Your patience and care have made a difference. It shows that even the most skittish cats can blossom in their own time with love and understanding. Tucker is lucky to have found such a loving home with you.\n\nTo all other readers facing similar challenges, remember that every cat has its own pace of adjustment. With patience, love, and the right environment, your furry friend can become a confident and affectionate companion. Don't give up -- your efforts will be rewarded.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hairball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocker_Spaniel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocker Spaniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neutering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alarm clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockapoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cockapoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Cats", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Pet_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Pet Supplies", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Supplies", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/300/30007/3000723.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778503", "eventUri": "eng-9778503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 460123076, "relevance": 2}

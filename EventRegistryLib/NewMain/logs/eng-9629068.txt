Swiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday. \"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\u009d In Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy, a 6-3, 6-1 winner against unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia in the second semifinal. Swiatek is trying to earn her fourth championship in five years at the French Open and can become the first woman with three in a row since Justine Henin from 2007-09. For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January. Swiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player - and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals. \"She is progressing a lot.

Putting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris. Displaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors - while Gauff finished with 39. This is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come. There was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29. \"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\u009d It did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland - even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus)PARIS (AP) - Iga Swiatek is as good as it gets in tennis at the moment, especially at the French Open. Been that way for quite some time. So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere - and certainly at Roland Garros - should come as no surprise by now. Swiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday. \"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\u009d In Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia or No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy. Swiatek is trying to earn her fourth championship in five years at the French Open and can become the first woman with three in a row since Justine Henin from 2007-09. Swiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player - and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals. \"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\u009d As far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable. Swiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past two weeks, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid. Putting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris. Displaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors - while Gauff finished with 39. This is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come. It did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland - even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set. When Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break. Swiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there. It's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this. In each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert. In the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte. A serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did. \"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\"\u009d Gauff told the official. The 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.

So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia or No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy.\n\nSwiatek is trying to earn her fourth championship in five years at the French Open and can become the first woman with three in a row since Justine Henin from 2007-09.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past two weeks, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal.

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\nAP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report.\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "howard_fendrich@reformer.com", "name": "Howard Fendrich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/1c/71c95ba1-f888-5b3a-8e4c-ca369d336049/6661cdcca8603.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Been that way for quite some time. So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia or No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy.\n\nSwiatek is trying to earn her fourth championship in five years at the French Open and can become the first woman with three in a row since Justine Henin from 2007-09.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past two weeks, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy.

So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy, a 6-3, 6-1 winner against unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia in the second semifinal.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

The Delray Beach native is in her third straight Grand Slam semifinal, this one on the red clay of Roland Garros at the 2024 French Open.\n\nGauff, the No. 3 player in the WTA rankings, bested No. 9 Ons Jabeur on Tuesday in three sets. The 20-year-old won the U.S. Open in September and made the semifinals at the Australian Open in January. Now she'll face world No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals.\n\nAs if that's not enough, Gauff is also in the women's doubles semifinals after she and Katerina Siniakova won in straight sets Wednesday. The pair will face Carolina Dolehide and Desirae Krawczyk on Friday.\n\nGauff has never been shy to use her voice, speaking out against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before the start of the tournament. She made headlines during the tournament as well by criticizing the French Open schedule that had some matches ending around 3 a.m. local time.\n\nSwiatek beat Gauff in the 2022 French Open final, which marked the first Grand Slam finals appearance for the then-18-year-old Florida native. The 22-year-old Swiatek has won back-to-back French Opens to give her three for her career. The winner will face either 12th-seeded Jasmine Paolini or unseeded Mirra Andreeva in the final on Sunday.\n\nCoco Gauff's match vs. Iga Swiatek in the 2024 French Open will not start before 9 a.m. ET Thursday, June 6 at Roland Garros in Paris.\n\nWhat channel is Coco Gauff match vs Iga Swiatek in French Open?\n\nCoverage from the French Open will begin on the Tennis Channel at 6 a.m. with NBC airing the women's semifinals starting at 11 a.m. Streaming options include fuboTV, which offers a free trial to potential subscribers.", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delray_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delray Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delray Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirae_Krawczyk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desirae Krawczyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate\u0159ina_Siniakov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/02/USAT/73950232007-usatsi-23453649.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4345,2444,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1503, "textEnd": 1509}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Been that way for quite some time. So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy, a 6-3, 6-1 winner against unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia in the second semifinal.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

Been that way for quite some time. So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy, a 6-3, 6-1 winner against unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia in the second semifinal.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench.

But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte over a ruling.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal, know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, and they gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo. Swiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy, which shouldn't be a surprise against Gauff.

Been that way for quite some time. So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy, a 6-3, 6-1 winner against unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia in the second semifinal.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

The Poland native also is vying to become the first woman with three consecutive French Open titles since Justine Henin of Belgium accomplished the feat from 2005-07.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" Swiatek said. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nSwiatek, 23, will face a first-time Grand Slam finalist on Saturday, either unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia or 12th-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy. Andreeva and Paolini met in Thursday's other semifinal.\n\nSwiatek benefited from 39 unforced errors from Gauff to improve to 11-1 in head-to-head meetings. That includes defeating her in the title match at Roland Garros in 2022 and the quarterfinals in 2023.\n\nSwiatek did not drop serve during the opening set Thursday before Gauff showed some gumption in the second. Gauff broke Swiatek to claim a 3-1 lead, but not before the reigning U.S. Open champion was moved to tears after an exchange with chair umpire Aurelie Tourte.\n\nSwiatek's serve initially was called out but the umpire overruled the call. Gauff, 20, misfired on the return but told the umpire she did so after the line call was made.\n\n\"Are you serious? They are booing you because you are wrong,\" Gauff told Tourte.\n\nSwiatek swiftly responded by winning the next four games and captured the match after Gauff's forehand sailed out of bounds.\n\n\"It was intense,\" Swiatek said. \"In the second set it was tight because we were breaking each other. I was consistent with my tactics and went for it.\n\n\"I think Coco is progressing a lot, you can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open shows she's tough, she's going to grow, so it's nice to see her handling well everything around her.

Unfortunately for Gauff, it didn't work as Swiatek again found a way to beat the American, who will reach a new career-high ranking of No. 2 on Monday.\n\nBy beating Gauff, 23-year-old Swiatek improved to a lifetime 11-1 against the American. Also, Swiatek secured her fourth final at the French Open.\n\nSwiatek will learn her final opponent after Jasmine Paolini and Mirra Andreeva finish the other semifinal.\n\nSwiatek got off to the best possible start to the match, breaking Gauff in the very first game.

One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though Gauff did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte over a ruling.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal, know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, and they gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo. Swiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy, which shouldn't be a surprise against Gauff. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/6/6/iga-swiatek-1-2131108-1717687196020.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

A 6-1, 6-3 loss to Swiatek in the 2022 French Open.\n\nThis will be the 12th time the two have faced off, with Swiatek owning a 10-1 record against Gauff, who's only win in their series came in the semifinals of the Cincinnati Open last year -- a tournament Gauff would go on to win.\n\nThe winner heads to the final to take on Mirra Andreeva or Jasmine Paolini on Saturday.\n\nStay with Yahoo Sports as we have you covered for the French Open semifinal between Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff,", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FLvw3.m1u_f3UX.DK9g9kg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/4e487620-238c-11ef-b96e-b07149f1454c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Been that way for quite some time. So her unyielding success against Coco Gauff just about everywhere -- and certainly at Roland Garros -- should come as no surprise by now.\n\nSwiatek continued her mastery over Gauff and extended her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the semifinals on Thursday.\n\n\"For sure, it was intense,\" said the No. 1-ranked Swiatek, who claimed five of the last six games after trailing 3-1 in the second set. \"I'm happy that I just was consistent with my tactics and didn't overthink stuff and just went for it at the end.\"\n\nIn Saturday's title match, Swiatek will face No. 12 Jasmine Paolini of Italy, a 6-3, 6-1 winner against unseeded 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia in the second semifinal.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal, know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, and they gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo. Swiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy, which shouldn't be a surprise against Gauff. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@bostonherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/France_Tennis_French_Open_34390.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

You can also try Sling, which features promotional pricing offers for new customers.\n\nThursday's action will begin with the mixed doubles championship at 6 a.m. Eastern. The No. 2 ranked team of Laura Siegemund and \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin will face No. 4 Desirae Krawczyk and Neal Skupski.\n\nThere will also be men's doubles quarterfinal and semifinal matches happening as part of what looks to be an exciting finish to the tournament.\n\nHere are some additional details on how to watch Thursday's action:\n\nHere is some background on the women's semifinal match between No. 3 Coco Gauff and No. 1 Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, the defending French Open champion.\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Coco Gauff's long and successful Tuesday at Roland Garros began when she arrived at about 8:15 a.m. There was a warmup session. A couple of meals. A couple of matches. Oh, and a couple of victories -- first, one to reach the singles semifinals, and then one to reach the doubles quarterfinals, which wrapped up a little past 4:30 p.m.\n\n\"It goes by really fast, I will say,\" the 20-year-old American said. \"When you're playing the match, it just goes by really fast.\"\n\nThere is more work to be done, and there are more long days on the horizon, for Gauff, who will meet defending champion and No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek in singles on Thursday.\n\n\"It's good to just keep going and not think about this match as something huge -- just another match -- to not put too much baggage on your shoulders,\" Swiatek said. \"But I guess Coco is not easy. She really likes playing on clay, especially here. I'll just focus on myself and I'll prepare tactically and we'll see.\"\n\nSwiatek picked up yet another lopsided victory, beating Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-0, 6-2 and stretching her French Open winning streak to 19 matches as she seeks a third trophy in a row in Paris and her fourth in five years.\n\n\"She's, I feel like, way better than anyone else on clay, and especially here. It's very tough,\" Vondrousova said. \"I feel like on the court, you have nothing to maybe offer. She's just too strong here.\"\n\nNo. 3 Gauff came back to defeat three-time major finalist Ons Jabeur 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the semifinals at a third consecutive Grand Slam tournament.\n\n\"I've been trying to do better at being consistent in the big tournaments,\" Gauff said, \"and I'm reaching that level of consistency.\"\n\nShe won her first major title at the U.S. Open in September, then made it to the semifinals at the Australian Open in January. Gauff was runner-up to Swiatek at the French Open in 2022.\n\nOverall, Swiatek has won 10 of 11 meetings against Gauff, including a 6-4, 6-3 semifinal win on clay last month en route to the Italian Open title.\n\n\"I definitely think I have to find a better way to play her than the last times I played on clay, because I've obviously been unsuccessful the last couple of times we've played -- regardless of the surface and anything,\" Gauff said. \"She's definitely a tough opponent for me. And for anybody.\"\n\nSure is.\n\nThe day's biggest news was that defending champion Novak Djokovic withdrew from the men's bracket because of a torn meniscus in his right knee. He will be replaced at No. 1 in the ATP rankings by Jannik Sinner next week.\n\nCasper Ruud, the runner-up in Paris the past two years, got a walkover into the semifinals, where he will play Alexander Zverev or Alex de Minaur. Sinner beat Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday and next meets Carlos Alcaraz, a winner at night against Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nOther than a tough three-set triumph over Naomi Osaka in the second round, Swiatek has been dominant in this French Open. Take away the 17 games Osaka managed to win, and Swiatek has dropped a total of only 11 games in her other four matches.\n\nSwiatek followed up her 6-0, 6-0 shutout of Anastasia Potapova in the fourth round by grabbing the initial seven games against Vondrousova.\n\n\"I felt,\" Swiatek said, \"like I was in the zone.\"\n\nAnd make no mistake: Vondrousova is no slouch. In addition to being a Grand Slam champion, she was a finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics and currently is ranked No. 6.\n\nBut she never stood a chance against Swiatek, who compiled 25 winners to just 10 unforced errors. Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland, faced just one break point -- and, naturally, she saved it.\n\n\"Everything worked,\" Swiatek said.\n\nAgainst the eighth-seeded Jabeur, Gauff pulled away to lead 5-2 lead in the last set, then needed a trio of match points to close things out, acknowledging afterward that she grew a little tight. In the last game, Gauff needed to save a break point, before Jabeur dismissed one match point with a disguised drop shot that earned a roar from the stands. The 29-year-old Tunisian responded by putting her right index finger to her ear.\n\nBut on Gauff's next opportunity to seal the victory, Jabeur badly flubbed an overhead. Gauff smiled, then raised her arms and yelled.\n\n\"My favorite thing about Coco is her fighting spirit. I think she's playing, like, great tennis right now, but I saw her playing better before,\" Jabeur said. \"Obviously she's such a fighter. She always tries to find ways. She's really smart on the court.\"\n\nWith the crowd at the main stadium loudly supporting Jabeur at times, Gauff did not play badly in the opening set. But Jabeur was superb, winning 17 of 18 first-serve points, never facing a single break point and accumulating a 12-5 edge in total winners.\n\nWhen she delivered an ace at 114 mph (184 kph) to end the set, Jabeur nodded repeatedly.\n\n\"She's a tough opponent and she's well-loved on tour,\" Gauff said. \"I could tell by the crowd today -- I know you guys wanted her to win. Honestly, whenever she's not playing (me), I cheer for her, too.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The winner of this match will be heavily favored in Saturday's Roland Garros women's singles championship battle, all because of what happened on Wednesday in the women's quarterfinals. Swiatek and Gauff booked their semifinal spots on Tuesday. Everyone waited to see who would join them in the semis. The favorites on Wednesday were fourth-seeded Elena Rybakina and second-seeded Aryna Sabalenka. Rybakina and Sabalenka are both major champions. Sabalenka had faced Swiatek in the Madrid and Rome finals. Sabalenka had also reached seven straight major-tournament semifinals. There was every expectation that Sabalenka would advance to the semifinals, and it was more likely than not that Rybakina would join her, though Rybakina wasn't quite as large a favorite in the quarters.\n\nSurprise, surprise!\n\nNeither Sabalenka nor Rybakina advanced. Sabalenka lost to Mirra Andreeva, and Rybakina was taken out by Jasmine Paolini. Swiatek is the queen of red clay, having won three of the last four French Opens, but even if she loses to Gauff, it's clear that Gauff will be the commanding favorite over Paolini or Andreeva.\n\nBoth Swiatek and Gauff are elite players, but they really have to focus in on the task at hand and not think this is a championship match. It's more about beating the opponent on the other side of the net and executing a good game plan. Swiatek is the favorite, but Gauff is a tenacious competitor. Let's see what happens in a blockbuster matchup on one of the biggest stages in tennis.\n\nThe ruler of Roland Garros -- or should we say, \"Poland Garros\" -- has won 30 of her last 34 games. She has won three of her last five sets by a 6-0 score, and the other two sets by a 6-2 margin. She not only wins, but wins comfortably. She covered the spread in each of her last two matches. She is an in-form player, playing on her best surface and at the tournament she values more than any others. It is not easy to bet against her in this match or in any French Open match.\n\nWhy Coco Gauff Could Cover The Spread\n\nThis is the difference between evaluating tennis players and evaluating betting situations. In terms of evaluating tennis players, Swiatek is clearly better than Gauff on clay, because Swiatek is better than every other women's tennis player in the world on clay. She is a heavyweight on clay and will always have the upper hand at the French Open. However, while Swiatek is the better tennis player on clay, the betting situation is something else altogether. In terms of a betting calculus, Coco Gauff -- while not as good as Swiatek -- is good at keeping matches relatively close. Gauff is a tremendous competitor, and while Swiatek might come away with a straight-set win, those two sets probably won't be blowouts. In tennis, a 6-4, 6-3 win is a relatively straightforward and routine win. However, if that is the final score for this match, Gauff covers. If the spread had been 4.5 games, it would have been a different story. At 5.5 games, Gauff is a great pick.\n\nFinal Iga Swiatek-Coco Gauff Prediction & Pick\n\nIga Swiatek will win the match, but Gauff getting plus money for covering a 5.5-game spread looks very attractive.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_zemek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Zemek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Iga-Swiatek-vs.-Coco-Gauff-French-Open-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Swiatek eliminated Gauff from the French Open the last two years, including the 2022 final.\n\nPlus, while Gauff enjoys playing on red clay and has posted good results throughout her career, Swiatek is simply dominant on the surface with three Roland Garros titles already. This season, Swiatek took significant titles in Madrid and Rome while losing just one clay court match in the Stuttgart final.\n\nGauff came out this time with an aggressive mindset in an attempt to rush Swiatek's ground strokes and win the battle of court position. That tactic helped earn break points in Swiatek's first two service games, but Gauff's inability to convert put her under immediate pressure. Swiatek subsequently cruised to the first set.\n\nGauff, the reigning US Open champion, will own a career high ranking of No. 2 on Monday. Thursday was her third consecutive Grand Slam semifinal appearance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: French Open: Coco Gauff's run ends against Iga Swiatek in semifinals", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_wolken@aol.com", "name": "Dan Wolken", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_y4iVGMFsjY9Ysw1YAp5AA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/68f9e1b878678901b15227a3aa15275d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The opponents she faced years ago on the junior circuit are many of the same players she battles now as a top professional. If she and her contemporaries enjoy the long, full careers they are working towards, many of the same faces will be there until the end.\n\nThis means that Gauff, at 20 years old, has a long time to work towards reconfiguring her game and changing the direction of match-ups with Iga Swiatek, but it is also hard not to wonder how excruciating these encounters could become over the next 10 years. Like last year in the quarter-finals and the final a year before, Swiatek continued her dominance of Gauff as she reached her fourth French Open final with a 6-2, 6-4 win. Her record against the American stands at 11-1.\n\nRelated: Paolini sweeps past Andreeva, Swiatek beats Gauff: French Open women's semi-finals - live\n\nJust a few days after her 23rd birthday, Swiatek has now reached four Roland Garros finals in her past five appearances. She stands one match away from a generational achievement that would cement her spot among the clay court greats: on Saturday, Swiatek will attempt to become the third woman in the open era to win three consecutive French Open titles. No woman has achieved this feat since Justine Henin in 2007.\n\nHaving arrived here with titles at Madrid and Rome, Swiatek has won 18 matches in a row, equalling her longest winning streak on clay from 2022. She has compiled a 16-4 record against top-five players since reaching No 1 in March. Last Wednesday, her pursuit of history was nearly derailed by Naomi Osaka in their instant classic second-round match. She has been on a revenge tour ever since.\n\nThe task ahead of Gauff on Thursday was succinctly summed up one point into the contest. After Gauff struck a forehand error, a voice rang out from the crowd: \"Allez Coco! C'est pas fini.\" (It's not over). The fan may have felt differently after the first game ended with Gauff quickly striking three forehand errors and losing her serve.\n\nGauff's desperate record against Swiatek has certainly not been for a lack of trying. Each time she has fallen badly short, the American has made significant changes to her approach. In last year's quarter-final, Gauff spent the match trying to junkball Swiatek with slow, loopy topspin forehands, a tactic that was relatively successful. Swiatek still won 6-4, 6-2.\n\nThis time, Gauff was determined to attack as early as possible, but it is not her style of play. Her error count grew and she missed by several centimetres rather than millimetres. While still in third gear, striking two winners and five unforced errors compared with 12 winners and 18 unforced errors from Gauff, Swiatek rolled through the set.\n\nGauff has spoken impressively about her difficult match-up with Swiatek, always resolving to approach each new match with a clean slate, but it is clear that so many defeats have left a mark. While Swiatek was just testing the waters and finding her feeth, in the opening few games Gauff already looked like she was fighting for her life in a final set.\n\nAs Gauff found joy with her first serve and strung games together early in the second set, she was urged on by the crowd, breaking serve for a 1-3 lead. But Swiatek always looked comfortable. She immediately forced herself inside the baseline, took control of the exchanges and methodically broke Gauff's forehand. From 1-3 down, she rolled through four consecutive games before calmly serving out the match.\n\nThe defeat places Gauff in a curious position. On one hand, she is doing incredibly well; she has more than fulfilled the hype that has followed her since her teenage year, establishing herself as a grand slam champion and one of the very best players in the world.

plenty of chances, but was erratic from the baseline, missing both break points she created and hitting 18 unforced errors to effectively hand Swiatek the first set.\n\nThe youngster found some consistency early in the second set, moving 2-1 ahead on serve.\n\nGauff then became embroiled in a heated exchange with the chair umpire over the timing of a line call, exclaiming \"it's a Grand Slam semi-final, know the rules of the game\", while almost moved to tears.\n\nThat perceived injustice helped the American briefly raise her game, snatching her first break of the match after a long rally to lead 3-1, only to be pegged back immediately.\n\nThere was only going to be one outcome from then on as Swiatek reeled off four games in a row to take complete control.\n\nGauff dug deep, saving two match points to force Swiatek to serve it out.\n\nSwiatek sealed a place in her fourth French Open final in five years on her fourth match point as another wild Gauff forehand flew well off

Read more in Kenny Ducey's breakdown below.\n\nThe French Open semifinals are all set, with the women's draw taking center stage on Thursday in Paris to set up the first final of the weekend.\n\nThe first match of the day will be a rematch of the 2022 Roland Garros final, as Iga Swiatek is set to take on Coco Gauff in French Open odds. With the World No. 1 looking unstoppable this week and controlling the head-to-head history, what can we expect from both players?\n\nLet's take a look at how the match should shake out in our free Swiatek vs. Gauff predictions for June 6.\n\nIga Swiatek has won the French Open in three of the last four seasons and has only lost twice at Roland Garros - one being when she debuted here as a teenager just before the pandemic. She's been a hard woman to knock off anywhere, but here in Paris, she may be building a run of form reminiscent of Rafael Nadal.\n\nOn clay, in particular, Swiatek's devastating topspin forehand is insanely difficult to combat. As a result, she's yet to lose more than twice in a season on the surface over the last five seasons.\n\nThat leads us to Thursday's semifinal, where Coco Gauff should be in for a really tough test. She's only defeated Swiatek once in 11 tries, which came on a quicker outdoor hardcourt last year, and stylistically, this is a matchup nightmare given the glaring weakness in her game.\n\nGauff's forehand has long been talked about as the biggest thing she needs to improve to reach the top of the women's game. While she's achieved a top-five ranking and won a Grand Slam, her forehand can't come close to competing with Swiatek's here, especially with how it's looked this week.\n\nUltimately, it will take a very bad day for Swiatek to hand Gauff a spot in Saturday's final.\n\nPrediction: Swiatek moneyline (-650 at DraftKings)\n\nThis is admittedly an incredibly sharp line by oddsmakers, and every bet involved in this match offers little value. The last meeting between these two took place a couple of weeks ago in Rome and ended 6-4, 6-3 in favor of Swiatek. With a spread of 5.5 games and a total of 18.5, it would seem the books are correctly using that as a barometer of how this one will go.\n\nI will point out, however, that Rome is not Roland Garros - especially not to Swiatek. She defeated Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the quarterfinal stage of last year's French Open and took her out 6-1, 6-3 in the 2022 French Open final. Given she's had some more crooked scorelines in all of her wins over the American, the smart play here is to fade the narrative that this might be close after how their meeting in Rome went.\n\nThis clay is now much drier after a ton of rain in the first week, and with that, there's an opening here for Swiatek to run away with this one behind a forehand that will be at full strength in these improved conditions.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/f5fae4ee-604b-47f5-888f-02b1ad0fdf03.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 743, "textEnd": 749}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

He called it before I hit it. Can you ask him?\"\n\nTourte: \"We cannot ask him.\"\n\nGauff: \"They're booing because you're wrong... I have the right to finish my swing.\"\n\nTourte: \"To me it didn't affect the shot.\"\n\nGauff: \"This is the second time this has happened. It's a grand slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game.\"\n\nAn emotional Gauff appeared to be tearing up after returning to the baseline, but was able to recover and break Swiatek for a 3-1 lead in the set after dropping the opener 6-2.\n\nHowever, Swiatek, who has won three of the past four French Opens, won five of the final six games to win the match and advance to the finals against the winner of the Jasmine Paolini-Mirra Andreeva match.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion, and has defeated her at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red and white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed it. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though Gauff did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point.

She is the third player since 2000 to make three consecutive French Open women's singles finals, joining Justine Henin (2005-2007) and Maria Sharapova (2012-2014).\n\nSwiatek has won 20 straight matches at the tournament, making her only the fifth woman in the Open Era to win 20 consecutive matches at Roland Garros. She joins Chris Evert (29 straight, 1984-1991), Monica Seles (25, 1990-1996), Justine Henin (24, 2005-2010), and Stefanie Graf (20, 1987-1989).\n\nThe 23-year-old Swiatek is also the second-youngest player in the Open Era to make four French Open finals, older only than Stefanie Graf, who was 20 when she made her fourth Roland Garros final in 1990.\n\nSwiatek is also in the midst of another lengthy clay-court winning streak, having now won 18 straight matches on the surface. This current run ties her longest winning streak on clay, which was 18 straight between Stuttgart and Warsaw in 2022.\n\nTale of the tape: Gauff, who is projected to rise to a career-high World No.2 ranking in the PIF WTA Rankings on Monday, had never won a set off of Swiatek on clay. Indeed, Thursday's match started with an opening set where Swiatek never dropped serve.\n\nHowever, Gauff had a chance to turn that stat around in the second set. Gauff broke for a 3-1 lead by dominating a rally, then finding the baseline with a fierce forehand.\n\nHowever, Swiatek was not fazed and she immediately pulled back on serve, using powerful forehands of her own to scoop up four straight games and a 5-3 lead.\n\nIn the next game, Gauff stared down two match points on her own serve, but the American erased those chances, forcing Swiatek to serve out the match at 5-4. Swiatek was up to the challenge and converted her fourth match point after a Gauff forehand flew out of bounds.\n\nGauff had 27 winners to Swiatek's 10 in the showdown, but the American also had 39 unforced errors to just 14 from Swiatek. And behind their respective second serves, Swiatek was much more effective, winning 67 percent of those points, while Gauff won 32 percent.", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monica Seles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sharapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Razors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Razors", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Razors", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Razors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight_Edge", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight Edge", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/06/06/497f1c63-91cf-438c-ab7c-64dc0a8d1586/BERTRAND-GUAYAFP-via-Getty-Images-.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In the second set it was right because we were breaking each other. I was consistent with my tactics and went for it,\" Swiatek said.\n\nDefeat was a big blow for Gauff, who was beaten by Swiatek in the 2022 final as well as last year's quarter-finals, but she leaves Paris knowing that she will climb to number two in the world rankings on Monday.\n\n\"I think she's progressing a lot,\" Swiatek said of the 20-year-old U.S. Open champion.\n\n\"You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open showed she's tough. At this age, it's obvious she's going to just grow. It's nice to see her handling everything well around her, because it's not easy.\n\n\"I'm sure we'll have plenty more intense matches at the highest level. Coco is one of the most consistent players out there.\"\n\nSwiatek drew first blood by breaking in the opening game of the contest after a forehand error by the ultra aggressive Gauff and the top-seeded Pole fought off break points in her next two service games before tightening her grip.\n\nHaving dropped the first set following an error, Gauff wiped away tears while up 2-1 in the second after an argument with the umpire over a contentious line call, but the American recovered to break her opponent for the first time.\n\nHowever, Swiatek struck back immediately before holding and breaking to surge to a 4-3 lead with a powerful winner as a 20th straight victory at Roland Garros appeared in sight for the 23-year-old at her favourite hunting ground.\n\nSoaking up the applause at a sun-drenched Court Philippe-Chatrier, Madrid and Rome champion Swiatek secured victory on serve and equalled her 18-match winning streak on the sport's slowest surface between Stuttgart and Warsaw in 2022.\n\nSwiatek, who saved a match point to beat former world number one Naomi Osaka in the second round, has lost 14 games since and will be the favourite to prevail at the weekend.\n\n\"For sure something changed. I adjusted better to the court.

Four-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek also extended her dominance over Gauff by sealing an 11th victory in 12 meetings and will head into a Saturday showdown with either 12th seed Jasmine Paolini or 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva.\n\n\"It was intense. In the second set it was right because we were breaking each other. I was consistent with my tactics and went for it,\" Swiatek said. Defeat was a big blow for Gauff, who was beaten by Swiatek in the 2022 final as well as last year's quarter-finals, but she leaves Paris knowing that she will climb to number two in the world rankings on Monday.\n\n\"I think she's progressing a lot,\" Swiatek said of the 20-year-old U.S. Open champion. \"You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open showed she's tough. At this age, it's obvious she's going to just grow. It's nice to see her handling everything well around her, because it's not easy.\n\n\"I'm sure we'll have plenty more intense matches at the highest level. Coco is one of the most consistent players out there.\" Swiatek drew first blood by breaking in the opening game of the contest after a forehand error by the ultra aggressive Gauff and the top-seeded Pole fought off break points in her next two service games before tightening her grip.\n\nHaving dropped the first set following an error, Gauff wiped away tears while up 2-1 in the second after an argument with the umpire over a contentious line call, but the American recovered to break her opponent for the first time. However, Swiatek struck back immediately before holding and breaking to surge to a 4-3 lead with a powerful winner as a 20th straight victory at Roland Garros appeared in sight for the 23-year-old at her favourite hunting ground.\n\nSoaking up the applause at a sun-drenched Court Philippe-Chatrier, Madrid and Rome champion Swiatek secured victory on serve and equalled her 18-match winning streak on the sport's slowest surface between Stuttgart and Warsaw in 2022. Swiatek, who saved a match point to beat former world number one Naomi Osaka in the second round, has lost 14 games since and will be the favourite to prevail at the weekend.\n\n\"For sure something changed. I adjusted better to the court. It's not easy to play the first matches at a Grand Slam because the atmosphere is different than other tournaments,\" she said. \"Against Naomi I didn't have time to get into it. She was intense from the beginning and put pressure on me. I'm happy I handled it well.\n\n\"After that the weather changed. It helps my game I feel.

Swiatek eliminated Gauff from the French Open the last two years, including the 2022 final.\n\nPlus, while Gauff enjoys playing on red clay and has posted good results throughout her career, Swiatek is simply dominant on the surface with three Roland Garros titles already. This season, Swiatek took significant titles in Madrid and Rome while losing just one clay court match in the Stuttgart final.\n\nGauff came out this time with an aggressive mindset in an attempt to rush Swiatek's ground strokes and win the battle of court position. That tactic helped earn break points in Swiatek's first two service games, but Gauff's inability to convert put her under immediate pressure.

I'm a thousand per cent sure,\" Gauff raged. \"If he called it before I hit it, I stop my reaction. I didn't even finish my follow-through.\"\n\nTourte was adamant the call did not affect Gauff's shot.\n\n\"You're wrong,\" insisted Gauff. \"It's the second time that happened. You should be ashamed. It's a grand slam semi-final, know the rules of the game.\"\n\nGauff doubled down on her opinion afterwards, calling for video replays to be used.\n\n\"I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person,\" she said.\n\n\"At this point it's almost ridiculous that we don't have it. Not also just speaking because that happened to me, but I just think every sport has it.\n\n\"Also, there are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right, and it's like, what does that give you in that moment?\"\n\nGauff, fuelled by a sense of injustice, went on to break Swiatek's serve for the first time in the match to lead 3-1 in the second set.\n\nBut Swiatek hit back and although Gauff saved three match points, a forehand wide on the fourth sent the favourite through to another Paris final.\n\n\"I think I was pretty intense and putting pressure on Coco,\" said Swiatek.\n\n\"Even though I got broken at the beginning of the second set, I knew that I can come back quickly, and I got my level of intensity a little bit higher to do that.\n\n\"I think most of the things overall in my game worked today, so I'm proud of myself.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jasmine Paolini crushed Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva 6-3 6-1 to bulldoze her way into the French Open final and continue Italy's Roland Garros fairytale.\n\nThe diminutive 28-year-old is the first Italian player to reach the final on the Paris clay since doubles partner Sara Errani in 2012, and her resounding victory came two days after compatriot Jannik Sinner made it to the last four in the men's draw, guaranteeing he would be world number one next week.\n\nPaolini, who used her booming forehand to devastating effect on court Philippe Chatrier, will face the ultimate challenge in Iga Swiatek, after the world number one and two-time defending

The flashpoint came as Gauff was trying to claw her way back into the match, leading 2-1 in the second set on the Swiatek serve.\n\nSwiatek's second serve was called out just as Gauff hit her return long. But when the umpire overruled the call and awarded the point to Swiatek, Gauff furiously insisted that she hit her return after the ball had already been called out, and so the point should have been replayed.\n\n'He called it and then I hit it. I'm a thousand per cent sure,' said the American.\n\nCoco Gauff was left in tears after rowing with the umpire in her French Open semi-final defeat\n\nIga Swiatek's second serve was called out just as Gauff hit her return long, sparking the row\n\n'For me it did not affect your shot,' replied umpire Aurelie Tourte.\n\n'If he called it before I hit it, I stop my reaction. I didn't even finish my follow-through. He called it before I hit it. Will you ask him?'\n\n'No, we cannot ask him.'\n\nThe crowd were booing enthusiastically at this point - a Pavlovian reaction from the fans here whenever any incident occurs.\n\n'They're booing because you're wrong,' said Gauff.\n\n'For me it did not affect the shot.'\n\n'You're wrong. It's the second time that happened. You should be ashamed. It's a grand slam semi-final, know the rules of the game.'\n\nGauff eventually let it go and appeared to be wiping away tears as she walked back to her mark.\n\nSo, who was right? Replays suggest the call happened at the same instant as Gauff played her return. That makes it marginal either way but Gauff's argument that the call made her pull out of her follow-through is a convincing one.\n\nGauff did end up breaking in that game for a 3-1 lead but Swiatek won the next four games in a row and served out a comfortable win.\n\nGauff furiously insisted that she hit her return after the ball had already been called out\n\nThe American, seeded third in Paris, was beaten 6-2, 6-4 by world No. 1 Iga Swiatek\n\nTheir head to head now reads 11-1 in the Pole's favour and on this evidence it is difficult to see Gauff improving that any time soon.\n\nThe problem in a one-on-one sport like tennis is that when a player's natural game matches up so poorly against another, they are forced to go outside their comfort zone and that can almost shift the match up even further the other way.\n\nBoth these players like to rally and run, wearing their opponents down with controlled aggression. And Gauff is better at that style of play than any other player in the world - with one unfortunate exception.\n\nSo Gauff came out here and tried to blast Swiatek off the Philippe Chatrier court - as Naomi Osaka so nearly did in the second round. But that was Osaka playing her natural game; this was Gauff overreaching.\n\nThe first two points of the match saw her blast two forehands well long and that was sadly predictive of the rest of the set.\n\nThe result was that Swiatek was able to settle into don't miss mode and wait for her opponent to hand her the set. The 23-year-old ended the first set with two winners, four forced errors and five unforced - surely the first time she has won a set 6-2 with such modest statistics. Gauff had 12 winners but 11 forced and 18 unforced errors.\n\nSo of the 31 points Swiatek required to take the first set, 29 were courtesy of Gauff errors.\n\nGauff improved in the second set. She was more selective in her aggression and focused more on depth than power, pinning Swiatek back at times. But the unforced error count was still far too high and the match ended, as it had begun, with a Gauff forehand ballooning long.\n\nSo Swiatek marches on towards what everyone expects will be a fourth French Open title in five years. And Gauff must once again sit down with her team and address this most pertinent question: how on earth can I beat Iga Swiatek?", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/06/15/85798757-0-image-m-35_1717685316658.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

I've improved my feel and gained confidence.\"\n\nThe Pole's career win-loss record at Roland Garros now stands at a staggering 34-2, while she is on a 20-match winning streak at the event.\n\nThat has attracted comparisons with Rafael Nadal, who has won a record 14 men's titles and holds a 112-4 French Open record, with local media creating a verb, 'Nadaliser', to describe Swiatek's dominance on clay.\n\n\"We'll see in 14 years if the journey is similar. That's obviously really nice for me,\" said Swiatek.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwiatek is on a 20-match winning streak at the French Open. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\"I would never expect anybody to compare me to Rafa because for me he's above everybody, and he's a total legend. We'll see in couple of years, but I'm proud of myself that I'm playing consistently here and that I'm mentioned in the same sentence as Rafa. That's cool.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old has won all four of her previous Grand Slam finals and will bid to extend that run against Jasmine Paolini on Saturday.\n\nSwiatek has won both her previous meetings with 12th seed Paolini, although the last of those was at the 2022 US Open and the Italian is enjoying by far the best year of her career.\n\n\"I need to prepare tactically and see what her game is at now because for sure she has (had) the best season, so she must have changed something,\" Swiatek said.\n\nSwiatek hit only 10 winners in an unspectacular display by her high standards, but US Open champion Gauff made 39 unforced errors and was left holding back tears following an argument with the chair umpire.\n\nTop seed Swiatek could become only the fourth woman to win four Roland Garros titles in the Open era -- after Henin, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf.\n\nShe is also on track to join Serena Williams as the only women to complete the treble of French, Madrid and Rome Open titles in the same year.\n\nGauff, who will rise to world number two next week, has now lost 11 of her 12 matches against Swiatek, all in straight sets.\n\nCoco Gauff. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThat includes three successive defeats at Roland Garros, after last year's quarter-finals and the 2022 final.\n\nSwiatek, who had three bagel sets across her previous two matches, quickly struck first blood with a break in the opening game.\n\nGauff had plenty of chances, but was erratic from the baseline, missing both break points she created and hitting 18 unforced errors to effectively hand Swiatek the first set.\n\nThe youngster found some consistency early in the second set, moving 2-1 ahead on serve.\n\nGauff then became embroiled in a heated exchange with the chair umpire over the timing of a line call, exclaiming \"it's a Grand Slam semi-final, know the rules of the game\", while almost moved to tears.\n\n\"I definitely think at this point it's almost ridiculous that we don't have it,\" Gauff said of the lack of video replays.\n\nThat perceived injustice helped the American briefly raise her game, snatching her first break of the match after a long rally to lead 3-1, only to be pegged back immediately.\n\nThere was only going to be one outcome from then on as Swiatek reeled off four games in a row to take complete control.\n\nGauff dug deep, saving two match points to force Swiatek to serve it out.\n\nSwiatek sealed a place in her fourth French Open final in five years on her fourth match point as another wild Gauff forehand flew well off target.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@the42.ie", "name": "Agence

Swiatek is now 11-1 in their all-time series.\n\nSwiatek has won 18 consecutive clay matches, as well as 20 straight at the French Open, with her last loss being in the 2021 quarterfinals.\n\nSwiatek was able to break Gauff twice in the first set, but the American star showed mental maturity and stayed focused to make it more competitive. Gauff, who has reached a career-high World No. 2 ranking, was aggressive during the match and used her speed as an advantage. However, too many unforced errors and some struggles with her forehand proved costly for her.\n\nGauff was able to find a 3-1 lead in the second set despite an emotional moment after a disagreement with the chair umpire over a call. But just when she was picking up momentum, Swiatek reminded the Roland Garros crowd why she is the World No. 1 and climbed her way back up to get the job done in straight sets.\n\nGauff did not go down without a fight, as Swiatek had the advantage when she was up 5-3 but the 20-year-old managed to hold serve and force Swiatek to serve out the match.\n\nSwiatek will take on the winner of the matchup between No. 12 seed Jasmine Paolini.

Nervy forehand from Swiatek goes long, 15-15. Gauff lets her off the hook with a forehand return that goes long, 30-15.\n\nGauff goes for a forehand but nets. Two match points. All out attack from Gauff to save the first match point.\n\nGAME SET MATCH SWIATEK. One final forehand error from Gauff and Swiatek reaches yet another French Open final.\n\nSwiatek wants to get this match done now and yet another forehand error by Gauff gives her a match point.\n\nGreat time for Gauff to come up with her best forehands of the match and she crushes a winner into the corner, deuce.\n\nSwiatek gets another chance when Gauff nets a backhand. And she stays in the game when Swiatek miscues a forehand wide. If she can hold here, maybe Swiatek might get tight.\n\nBold play by Gauff and she finishes the game with a backhand winner. Pressure on Swiatek now.\n\nAnother routine hold by Swiatek and a fourth game in a row to put her within a game of the final.\n\nError-strewn game from Swiatek and she slips to 0-40. Swiatek senses the opportunity and takes it. She attacks Gauff's forehand, which opens space on the backhand side. Gauff is forced to put him a defensive lob but Swiatek manages a difficult shot easily, putting away an overhead smash to break.\n\nSwiatek consolidates the break and levels the set. Chris Evert on commentary says Gauff's forehand woes stem from bad footwork. If the forehand was on the same level as her backhand, this match up would be a lot tighter.\n\nBack comes Swiatek as she earns a break point with a brilliant cross court forehand winner. And she duly gets the break back when Gauff's tame forehand clips the net cord and the ball flies long.\n\nGauff is not happy. She is very frustrated with the umpire and is in tears. She returned a shot but the serve was called out by the linesperson and overruled by the umpire. The return by Gauff went wide and she believes she was distracted by the call from the lino. And she has a point. The umpire disagrees and insists the point goes to Swiatek. \"They're booing because they know you're wrong,\" Gauff says.\n\nGauff needs a moment at the back of the court to compose herself again and credit to her, she gets a break point. Unfortunately for her Swiatek comes up big with a forehand winner.\n\nGauff gets another break point opportunity and this time she takes it. She goes on the offensive and opens up the court, giving herself a forehand down the line which is too hot for Swiatek.\n\nGame on?\n\nGauff is trying anything at the moment to build some momentum. She attempts a drop shot but nets. She knows the longer the rallies go, the more dominant Swiatek comes. Third ace of the match makes it 40-30 and holds with a forehand winner.\n\nGauff moves to 13 unforced errors on the forehand side, 24 in the match so far. The numbers tell it all at the moment.\n\nI don't think Swiatek has had to get out of first gear so far.\n\nMust win game for Gauff to give her some belief but a double fault makes it deuce. Gauff wipes her face and looks on forlornly. She hasn't been allowed to settle by Swiatek, who has ruthlessly exposed her forehand.\n\nBut credit to the 20-year-old, who eventually comes through when Swiatek needs a backhand.\n\nSlumped shoulders from Gauff after another poor forehand error. Forehand return long gives Swiatek a set point.\n\nAnd she takes it when Gauff nets a forehand. Big problems for the American, who opts to leave the court for a comfort break.\n\nBig 'come on' from Gauff as she holds to 15. She needs some momentum and belief going into the second set.\n\nBut first things first, Swiatek must serve for this set.\n\nSwiatek has attacked Gauff's forehand and shattered the confidence of the American. Swiatek is a great front runner and she's stamping her authority all over this match.\n\nSwiatek holds to 15. Chris Evert says: 'This first set is pretty much over.\"\n\nReally bad game by Gauff and the body language isn't positive. She slips to 15-40 with a double fault and saves the first break point to keep her in this set.\n\nBut not the second as she nets a backhand tamely. Swiatek breaks and is in total command at the moment.\n\nHuge statement by the legend Chris Evert as she claims Gauff as the best backhand in the women's game after she crushes a backhand winner down the line for a winner.\n\nGauff is starting to get a grip on the match and another Swiatek error gives the American a set point.\n\nOh dear. Gauff gets the ball she wants but the ball is on her forehand side and she overhits to gift Swiatek the point.\n\nSwiatek toughs out the game and she holds. Nine unforced errors by Gauff. She needs to keep that number low.\n\nRelief for Gauff as she holds to 15 to get on the scoreboard. She's avoided a bagel in this set and now needs to make sure she doesn't get a breadstick!\n\nSix hours and 54 minutes on court so far for Gauff. Seven hours and 13 minutes for Swiatek. Not a great deal of energy used by them.\n\nIf Gauff's forehand is weak, the backhand is her strength and she gives Swiatek a glimpse as she takes the game to 40-30 then hits a brilliant return winner to make it deuce.\n\nSwiatek miscues a forehand long and Gauff earns herself a break back point. Gutsy play by Swiatek to go at Gauff's strength with her first serve and she gets the unreturned ball.\n\nGreat work in this game by Gauff but Swiatek holds to consolidate the break.\n\nExpecting Swiatek to go after Gauff's forehand and expose the weakness on that side. And so it proves on the opening two points as she makes back-to-back unforced errors.\n\nEarly trouble for Gauff as Swiatek drills a backhand down the line for a winner. Two break points.\n\nAnd it's a break for Swiatek. Gauff is the aggressor and hits a good backhand that forces a high defensive lob by Swiatek. Gauff opts for a drive forehand but gets it all wrong as the ball sails well long.\n\nThe players are welcomed onto the court by MC Marc Maury. Game faces from both of them.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage of the first women's French Open semi-final between world No 1 Iga Swiatek and third seed Coco Gauff.\n\nIt is the 12th meeting between the two players with Swiatek leading the head-to-head 10-1. The two times they have played each other at Roland Garros, Swiatek has won both. Swiatek is also on an incredible 19-match winning run in Paris.\n\nBut despite the odds being stacked in her favour, the Pole is full of respect for the American.\n\n\"I think her mental game is a little bit better. Before it was kind of easier to 'crack her' when you were leading,\" Swiatek said of Gauff.\n\n\"But it's normal that she's making progress. She's at that age that everything goes pretty nicely, that if you're working hard then you will get progress.\n\n\"She's doing that and probably every aspect of her game is a little bit better because it's different being a teenager on the tour and then being a more mature player.\"\n\nGauff, who will move to a career high world No 2 in the rankings on Monday, has quietly and methodically gone about her business in Paris. She has reached the semi-finals of a major in three of her last four and the 20-year-old is determined to solve the problems Swiatek causes her.\n\n\"I've obviously been unsuccessful the last couple of times we've played, regardless of the surface and anything. She's definitely a tough opponent for me and for anybody,\" Gauff said.\n\n\"I just have to go back and watch, try to find what I have to do. I think she's playing great tennis here, so it's going to be a challenge, but I'm going to go into the match with a lot of belief that I can.\n\n\"I'm going to try to get a plan from my team and then also my own plan and see where we can find a blend.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fault_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double fault (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lob (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoreboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoreboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bagel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OYUQg8wEygXhTfawU9TlsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/8d3c64a63abefec106159c7ea5feace3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The Florida tennis sensation is more than just a prime athlete, using her platform to speak out on social issues and support causes important to her.\n\nHere's what to know about Gauff as she continues her incredible play:\n\nWhere is Coco Gauff from? Delray Beach, Florida\n\nCoco Gauff was born March 13, 2004, in Atlanta. But she grew up in Delray Beach, about 20 miles south of West Palm Beach and 53 miles north of Miami.\n\nShe did not go to high school locally because of her globetrotting tennis career, but she did earn her high school degree in 2022.\n\nHas Coco Gauff won a Grand Slam? She's a U.S. Open champion\n\nGauff has made it to two major finals: the 2023 U.S. Open and the 2022 French Open. She lost to world No. 1 Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-3 in the French Open final.\n\nIs Coco Gauff in a relationship? Who is Coco Gauff's boyfriend?\n\nCoco Gauff told Time that she's been dating someone for about a year but wants to keep his identity private. She has said he's from Atlanta and that her mom was his fourth-grade teacher.\n\n\"This is my first real relationship,\" Gauff told Time. \"To just have someone to talk to who is not involved in tennis at all gives me a fresh perspective.\"\n\nHow did Coco Gauff get her nickname? What is Coco Gauff's real name?\n\nCoco is a nickname: The tennis star's birth name is Cori Gauff, an homage to her father, Corey. Gauff told Sports Illustrated Kids in 2021 that the nickname came about because it would be confusing for people calling their names.\n\n\"I believe it was my aunt who said, 'Oh, we should just call her Coco,'\" she said. \"When my dad was growing up, people used to call him Co and I guess they just said, 'Oh, Coco's a cool nickname.' Ever since then, I've been going by Coco. For sure more people used Coco than Cori.\"\n\nCoco Gauff speaks out against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, in support of social causes\n\nGauff has used her fame to give a platform to a variety of causes, namely the importance of mental health. After winning her semifinal match en route to winning the 2023 U.S. Open, she shouted out fellow tennis star Naomi Osaka and thanked her for raising awareness for mental health.\n\nShe has spoken out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against the Florida law critics call \"Don't Say Gay,\" which effectively bans teachers from talking about LGBTQ issues such as gender identity and sexual orientation. Before the French Open, she called on Florida's youth to vote and criticized Gov. Ron DeSantis, telling the Associated Press it was \"a crazy time to be a Floridian, especially a Black one at that.\"\n\n\"We aren't happy with the current state of our government in Florida, especially everything with the books and just the way our office operates,\" Gauff said, referring to the rise in book bans in Florida schools and libraries.\n\nShe also has used her platform for less serious causes, calling out the USTA for making her and other athletes look like \"hideous looking people\" in an Australian Open promotion styled after Nickelodeon's \"Wild Thornberrys\" cartoon.\n\nCoco Gauff started at same tennis facility as Venus and Serena Williams\n\nGauff trained at Pompey Park, the same tennis grounds where Venus and Serena Williams developed into world-class tennis stars after moving to Florida in the 1990s.\n\n\"I've been playing there since I can remember,\" Gauff said in 2018. \"My first tennis memory is there. Everyone there, I feel like we're all a big family. I'm practicing there tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Williams sisters ruled the tennis world through most of the 21st century. Serena has 23 major titles, one behind Margaret Court for the most all time, spanning from the 1999 U.S. Open to the 2017 Australian Open. Venus won seven major singles championships, starting with Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2000 and ending with the 2008 Wimbledon title. And the two combined for 14 more Grand Slam doubles titles.\n\nWhen Gauff was awarded the key to the city of Delray Beach in 2018 at 14 years old, she said she dreamt of being \"the next Serena Williams.\" And her breakout win came in 2019 when she beat Venus in the first round at Wimbledon. The 15-year-old made it all the way to the Round of 16 that year.\n\nWho are Coco Gauff's parents? They were both athletes\n\nLike many star athletes, Coco Gauff is from an athletic family. Her dad, Corey Gauff, played college basketball at Georgia State from 1990 to 1993.\n\nHer mom, Candi Gauff, was a track star at Florida State from 1988 to 1992 when she was Candi Odom. She was also the South Florida Sun Sentinel's Athlete of the Year twice.\n\nNo. 3-ranked Coco Gauff plays No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals no earlier than 9 a.m. ET on Thursday, June 6. Coverage from Roland Garros will start on the Tennis Channel, and NBC will jump in at 11 a.m. The whole tournament can be streamed on Peacock, and other streaming options include fuboTV, which offers a free trial to potential subscribers.", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After 10 days of mostly solid tennis, Gauff's tournament ended in a flurry of scorching winners and spraying errors, against a player who generally makes opponents pay for nearly every one.\n\nThis wasn't the usual Swiatek demolition. She even had to work a little harder than when she came within a point of exiting the tournament, in the second round against Naomi Osaka. But when it was over the result was the same - this time with a more lopsided scoreline, on another day of frustration for Gauff in an increasingly lengthy string of them, against a player who may just doom her for the next decade. She had used Osaka's tactics of rushing Swiatek and being aggressive above all else well, throwing the kitchen sink at her opponent because that was the only choice she had.\n\nIn some situations, it's the sink that breaks.\n\nWhen the new rankings come out on Monday, Swiatek will be in the top spot, and Gauff will be right behind her at No. 2 for the first time. Yet, with the win on Thursday, Swiatek expanded her career-long domination of Gauff to 11 wins in 12 matches. Gauff's only triumph came in Cincinnati last August, in a tight, three-set match on a blazingly hot afternoon that had Gauff, a Floridian, who has relished hours of tennis in punishing heat all her life, in her happy place.\n\nOn Thursday though, Gauff was in Swiatek's happy place, a court and a tournament where she has lost just once in four years, where she has won the title in three of those years, where she now has 20 consecutive wins.\n\nAfter coming out shaky and letting Swiatek surge to the first set, Gauff appeared to get her teeth into the match midway through the second, nailing two lusty shots into the opposite postage stamp corners to break Swiatek's serve for the first time. She used a dispute with umpire Aurelie Tourte, which left her in tears, to galvanise her. She waved her hand to the crowd, signaling for more noise, and she pumped her arms, urging herself to stay on top. She had done what she came to do, and now she needed to see it through for three more games.\n\nShe couldn't.\n\nSwiatek broke Gauff's serve at the next two attempts, the second time without Gauff winning a point, to win four games in a row. At 3-5, Gauff saved two match points, to ask the question of the Pole's serve one more time, asking her to do what she simply doesn't do in this match-up, and err.\n\nShe would not.\n\nAfter Gauff saved two match points, and a third on Swiatek's serve, the fourth was too far -- Swiatek sailing through the finish line in 97 minutes.\n\nShe will play Italian 12th seed Jasmine Paolini or unseeded Russian Mirra Andreeva in the final on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_futterman@nytimes.com", "name": "Matthew Futterman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/06103016/GettyImages-2155662064-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

In essence and on court, though, it was hardly a rivalry in the term's literal sense. Across a decade-and-a-half of them standing across the net 22 times over, Serena came out a winner on 20 occasions and one of Sharapova's victories was a walkover.\n\nIga Swiatek versus Coco Gauff duels carry a similar lopsided ring to them. In the 11 matches going into their French Open semi-final, Swiatek had won 10, all of them in straight sets. Their 12th meeting on Thursday was no different, the Pole's 11th victory over the American no less dominant.\n\nSwiatek swept past the reigning US Open champion 6-2, 6-4 and sailed into another French Open final on a bright Parisian afternoon where things turned familiarly gloomy for Gauff against an opponent that has had her number. Not that Gauff's alone there. Certainly not on the red dirt of Roland Garros, where Swiatek flaunts a 34-2 win-loss record and stands one match away from a three-peat, a feat last achieved by Justine Henin in 2007 among the women.\n\nFirst-time Slam finalist Jasmine Paolini, who defeated the emotionally-overpowered teen Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 6-1 in the other semi-final, will be out to stop the Swiatek steamroller. However, given her force since being almost shown the door by Naomi Osaka in the second round, it would take some serious heavy lifting by the Italian. After saving that match point against Osaka, Swiatek has dropped just 14 games in four matches and delivered three bagels (6-0 set wins).\n\n\"For sure, something changed,\" Swiatek said in her on-court chat on Thursday looking back at the Osaka rescue act. \"I just adjusted better to the court... and I gained confidence, I would say.\"\n\nOn clay, that can spell doom for any opponent. Not least for Gauff, who increasingly seems bereft of belief and ideas to tackle the Swiatek storm which she has managed to overcome just once (on the hard courts of Cincinnati last year) since they first met in 2021.\n\nGauff's faltering forehand, her most glaring weakness, can often get masked by her overall defensive solidity and destructive backhand against most other players on the tour. Against the powerful Swiatek, however, it remains a sitting duck.\n\nAnd so when Gauff kicked off the semi-final with a long forehand and handed Swiatek the opening break, signs of the script not being any different to the previous two French Open editions -- Swiatek defeated her in both, including the 2022 final -- were evident. Gauff's backhand was on, taking it high and early, while she was also brave in attacking Swiatek's second serves. It made her earn a break back chance immediately, only for Swiatek to hold on.\n\nGauff had a second break point opportunity in the fourth game, but fluffed it courtesy another wild forehand. Asking Swiatek a few tough questions with her defence, the American continued to self-destruct with untimely errors (she ended with 39 unforced errors, 28 off the forehand wing). She was soon down a double break as Swiatek, although scratchy, was largely solid.\n\nThe third game of the second set showed why it isn't necessarily only about the tennis when Gauff faces Swiatek. Unhappy about a line call after a lengthy argument with the chair umpire, the 20-year-old walked back to the baseline teary-eyed. She was in an emotional whirlwind, and caught unexpectedly in that was Swiatek who got broken in that game after a couple of forehand errors from her this time.\n\nNot for nothing, though, is the Pole a four-time Slam winner. Champions take little time to strike back and Swiatek duly did, setting up a break point with a forehand return winner pouncing on Gauff's second serve. Swiatek was back to doing Swiatek things. And Gauff to doing Gauff things at the other end. A double fault and a wide forehand saw the American being broken to love and her hopes of a fight shattered.\n\nAs if to sum up the rout and the rivalry between the world No. 1 and the soon-to-be world No. 2, it ended how it began -- with a Gauff forehand error.\n\nBopanna, Ebden crash out in semis\n\nEarlier, Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden squandered a strong start to bow out in the men's doubles semi-finals, losing 5-7, 6-2, 2-6 to Italians Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori. The Indian-Aussie had beaten the same pair in the final of the Australian Open this year that gave Bopanna his first men's doubles Slam title.\n\nOn Thursday, though, with Ebden seemingly hampered by an injury, the duo couldn't carry the momentum of a fast start that saw them go 4-1 up for a strong finish. This was, however, a fourth straight Slam semi-final for the top-ranked pair, and a big improvement from its first-round exit in Paris last year.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sharapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fault_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double fault (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Vavassori", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Vavassori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Ebden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Ebden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Bolelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Bolelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohan_Bopanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohan Bopanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/06/1600x900/TENNIS-FRENCHOPEN--135_1717694605163_1717694625485.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

For Paolini, this will be her first Grand Slam final; she never even had made it past the second round in any of her initial 16 appearances at majors until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.\n\nSwiatek improved to 11-1 overall against No. 3 seed Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion. That is more victories than Swiatek has accumulated against any other player -- and includes head-to-head wins at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament three years in a row, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarterfinals.\n\n\"She is progressing a lot. You can see by her results. Last year's U.S. Open, for sure, showed that she's tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious that she's going to just grow. So it's nice to see her handling well everything around her, because it's not easy,\" said Swiatek, who turned 23 last week. \"I'm sure we're going to have plenty more really intense matches on the really highest level.\"\n\nAs far as Gauff is concerned, perhaps a different opponent would be preferable.\n\nSwiatek, who is 4-0 in major finals, has been at her dominant best for most of the past month, following up on titles at clay events in Rome and Madrid.\n\nPutting aside a three-set, second-round victory over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, when she was forced to save a match point, Swiatek has ceded a total of merely 17 games in her other five matches in Paris.\n\nDisplaying her usual brand of powerful-but-clean groundstrokes, Swiatek needed only 10 winners to advance on Thursday, in part because she made only 14 unforced errors -- while Gauff finished with 39.\n\nThis is what Swiatek does to whoever is across the net, particularly on clay: With defense and precision, she makes them hit so many shots that eventually the mistakes are bound to come.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic in the other semifinal. The key statistics were these: Paolini saved all six break points she faced, and she made just 10 unforced errors to Andreeva's 29.\n\n\"I was nervous in the first set,\" Paolini said, \"but ball after ball, I was getting relaxed.\"\n\nIt did not take long for Swiatek to assert herself on a sunny afternoon in Court Philippe Chatrier, where several spectators waved red-and-white flags of her native Poland -- even drawing an admonition from chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte in the second set.\n\nWhen Gauff missed the mark early, she really missed. One return went off her racket frame. Another flew 10 feet long. The opening game ended when Gauff wildly hit a swinging volley that landed way out, too, handing over a break.\n\nSwiatek went up by a double break at 4-1 when Gauff netted a backhand, then slapped her thigh and smacked her racket against a bag on her sideline bench. There were other examples of negative body language from Gauff: a bowed head here, slumped shoulders there.\n\nIt's not as though she did not have some chances to make more of a match of this.\n\nIn each of Swiatek's first two service games, she faced a break point. But each time, Gauff failed to convert.\n\nIn the second set, an hour into the semifinal, Gauff finally broke to lead 3-1. That came shortly after Gauff got into a disagreement with Tourte.\n\nA serve by Swiatek was called out just as Gauff was missing her attempted return. Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek, saying the line judge's call did not affect Gauff's swing; Gauff argued that it did.\n\n\"It's a Grand Slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff told the official.\n\nThe 20-year-old American wound up breaking there with a forehand winner down the line and she wagged her fingers to request louder support from the fans, who gave it to her.\n\nMight the momentum be shifting?\n\nNo.\n\nSwiatek immediately responded with a four-game run, and then it was just a matter of closing things out.\n\nThat wasn't easy. But Swiatek completed the job on her fourth match point when Gauff missed a forehand, eliciting chants of \"Iga! Iga!\" from the stands.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "heraldcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HeraldCourier.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_High_School_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia High School League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Retreat,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rural Retreat, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rural Retreat, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazewell_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tazewell County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tazewell County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

The Pole knew she had to pick herself up, and battle her way through regardless of the difficulties she may face.\n\nOn June 6, the defending champion took a big step towards a third successive Roland Garros title by dismantling teary American third seed Coco Gauff 6-2, 6-4 in the semi-finals, and stretch her winning streak in Paris to 20 matches.\n\nHer career win-loss record at the French Open now stands at a staggering 34-2.\n\nThe four-time Grand Slam champion also extended her dominance over Gauff by sealing an 11th victory in 12 meetings and will head into the final on June 8 with either Italian 12th seed Jasmine Paolini or 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva of Russia.\n\n\"For sure something changed. I adjusted better to the court,\" said Swiatek, who lost only 14 games in four matches since defeating Osaka.\n\n\"It's not easy to play the first matches on a Grand Slam because the atmosphere is much different.\n\n\"Against Naomi I didn't have time to get into it. She was intense from the beginning and put pressure on me. I'm happy I handled it well.\n\n\"After that the weather changed. It helps my game I feel. I just gained confidence I would say.\"\n\nShe drew first blood by breaking in the opening game of the contest, and the top seed fought off break points in her next two service games before tightening her grip.\n\nHaving dropped the first set following an error, Gauff wiped away tears while up 2-1 in the second after an argument with the umpire over a contentious line call. But the US Open champion recovered to break for the first time.\n\nHowever, Swiatek struck back immediately before holding and breaking to surge to a 4-3 lead with a powerful winner as victory appeared in sight for the 23-year-old at her favourite hunting ground.\n\nSoaking up the applause at a sun-drenched Court Philippe-Chatrier, Swiatek secured the win on serve and equalled her 18-match winning streak on the sport's slowest surface between Stuttgart and Warsaw in 2022.\n\nSwiatek, who won her first Slam at Roland Garros in 2020 before winning again in 2022 and 2023, could become only the fourth woman to clinch four French Open titles in the Open era - after Justine Henin, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf.\n\nShe is also on track to join tennis great Serena Williams as the only women to complete the treble of French, Madrid and Rome Open titles in the same year.\n\nThe 2022 US Open winner had kind words for world No. 3 Gauff - who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/06/06/2024-06-06T144122Z1538307008UP1EK6614SX7JRTRMADP3TENNIS-FRENCHOPEN.JPG?VersionId=SkuIdlvQM50AlOOMmkJSvP71cSFpNnr2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 357, "textEnd": 363}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 815, "textEnd": 821}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Roland Garros 2024 Prize Money: How much money does the French Open winner take home?\n\nWith just five years on the professional circuit, Coco Gauff has already become one of the most important figures in tennis. The American tennis player has just climbed another step in her ascending career, facing one of the most challenging tests of her life.\n\nThe victory earned Gauff more than just a ticket to the semifinals. The points she has accrued on the clay courts of Roland Garros guarantee her a rise to number two in the world in the next WTA ranking. Gauff, however, must test her new ranking against the toughest opponent she could have expected.\n\nThe win over Jabeur put Gauff on a collision course with world number one Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals. The Polish player has been a steamroller throughout the tournament, securing resounding victories against nearly all of her rivals.\n\nThe only match that challenged her was the second round against one of the crowd's favorites, the Japanese Naomi Osaka. Swiatek and Osaka played one of the most exciting duels of this year, which ended with a victory for the Pole 7-6 (1), 1-6, and 7-5.\n\nShe noted that one of Swiatek's strengths is her mental fortitude. \"I think her mental game is a little bit better. It's normal that she's making progress. Every aspect of her game is a little bit better,\" she admitted.\n\nHowever, Gauff has been working on her own mental game. During matches, she has been seen meditating whenever she gets the chance. \"I like to lay on the ground and just meditate, whether it's for literally a minute or two or 10 or 15.\"", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/f963482aa0a4c7d1257d82acd7347924/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/06/17176320055064.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Eric Bolte-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCoco Gauff blazed into the French Open semifinals after a terrific win over Ons Jabeur. The 20-year-old has made it to 4 consecutive French Open semi-finals before turning 21 - a record that even Serena Williams doesn't have. But Gauff failed to overcome her long-time archrival Iga Swiatek at the big stage once again on Friday. The outspoken American made a comment which surely raised eyebrows before the match and that has come back to hurt her badly.\n\nIn context to the players Swiatek beat convincingly leading up to their semi-final and the fact that the Polish star is leading their one-sided rivalry, Gauff was quoted as saying to the media:\n\n\"It doesn't mean anything. Maybe I could lose with the same score, maybe not, but I'm just going to go in and just try to win. I have nothing to lose. All the pressure is on her.\"\n\nThat last line seemed as if it was one of Gauff's tricks to play mind games with the defending champion. However, as it turned out on Friday, Gauff was the one who had a lot to prove and failed at it again.\n\nIga Swiatek has a one-sided domination over Coco Gauff in their rivalry, sort of like the Serena Williams-Maria Sharapova rivalry. Their head-to-head stands at 11-1 now in favor of the World No.1, with Gauff winning her only match at the Cincinnati Open last year.\n\nThe lesson here for Coco Gauff to learn is that she needs to be mindful of not making provocative comments against her opponents and avoid playing such mind games. This is even though the American youngster is liked for being honest.\n\nCoco Gauff was very confident about winning the French Open after her impressive outings in the past French Open editions. 2024 clay swing. Gauff had a decent 2024 clay swing as well, making it to the quarterfinals of the Stuttgart Open, Round of 16 at the Madrid Open and the semifinals of the Italian Open.\n\nEven if it is a fact that the American women's No.1 player still has a lot of tennis ahead of her, the French Open 2024 semi-final loss would be considered as a failure by most of her fans. And there is a pattern of 'failures' which is developing and that could be worrying for Gauff herself.\n\nIn the Australian Open 2024, Coco Gauff was backed by many to win consecutive hard court Grand Slams after the US Open 2024. But the American lost to the eventual champion, Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals there too, in straight sets.\n\nGauff's big-match nerves are now questionable since she has failed to make it to the finals of any tournament since her ASB Classic title win in January 2024. It is never easy to sustain success in tennis. But she had created sky-high expectations because of being such a precocious talent even before she turned 20, that more eyes have been on her. This means more pressure to deliver and the stakes get higher as tournaments reach the final week or few days.\n\nIt could result in Coco Gauff developing a mental block of not believing in herself subconsciously before a big match and top rivals like Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina. That could be a huge concern for coach Brad Gilbert and his team and something they must work on before she is fit and ready to contest for the Wimbledon 2024 title in few weeks' time.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanmay_roy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanmay Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Auckland_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA Auckland Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Stuttgart_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Stuttgart Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/08/8412327e-untitled-design-21.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-08-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Florida tennis sensation is more than just a prime athlete, using her platform to speak out on social issues and support causes important to her.\n\nHere's what to know about Gauff as she continues her incredible play:\n\nCoco Gauff was born March 13, 2004, in Atlanta. But she grew up in Delray Beach, about 20 miles south of West Palm Beach and 53 miles north of Miami.\n\nShe did not go to high school locally because of her globetrotting tennis career, but she did earn her high school degree in 2022.\n\nGauff has made it to two major finals: the 2023 U.S. Open and the 2022 French Open. She lost to world No. 1 Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-3 in the French Open final.\n\nCoco Gauff told Time that she's been dating someone for about a year but wants to keep his identity private. She has said he's from Atlanta and that her mom was his fourth-grade teacher.\n\n\"This is my first real relationship,\" Gauff told Time. \"To just have someone to talk to who is not involved in tennis at all gives me a fresh perspective.\"\n\nCoco is a nickname: The tennis star's birth name is Cori Gauff, an homage to her father, Corey. Gauff told Sports Illustrated Kids in 2021 that the nickname came about because it would be confusing for people calling their names.\n\n\"I believe it was my aunt who said, 'Oh, we should just call her Coco,'\" she said. \"When my dad was growing up, people used to call him Co and I guess they just said, 'Oh, Coco's a cool nickname.' Ever since then, I've been going by Coco. For sure more people used Coco than Cori.\"\n\nGauff has used her fame to give a platform to a variety of causes, namely the importance of mental health. After winning her semifinal match en route to winning the 2023 U.S. Open, she shouted out fellow tennis star Naomi Osaka and thanked her for raising awareness for mental health.\n\nShe has spoken out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against the Florida law critics call \"Don't Say Gay,\" which effectively bans teachers from talking about LGBTQ issues such as gender identity and sexual orientation. Before the French Open, she called on Florida's youth to vote and criticized Gov. Ron DeSantis, telling the Associated Press it was \"a crazy time to be a Floridian, especially a Black one at that.\"\n\n\"We aren't happy with the current state of our government in Florida, especially everything with the books and just the way our office operates,\" Gauff said, referring to the rise in book bans in Florida schools and libraries.\n\nShe also has used her platform for less serious causes, calling out the USTA for making her and other athletes look like \"hideous looking people\" in an Australian Open promotion styled after Nickelodeon's \"Wild Thornberrys\" cartoon.\n\nGauff trained at Pompey Park, the same tennis grounds where Venus and Serena Williams developed into world-class tennis stars after moving to Florida in the 1990s.\n\n\"I've been playing there since I can remember,\" Gauff said in 2018. \"My first tennis memory is there. Everyone there, I feel like we're all a big family. I'm practicing there tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Williams sisters ruled the tennis world through most of the 21st century. Serena has 23 major titles, one behind Margaret Court for the most all time, spanning from the 1999 U.S. Open to the 2017 Australian Open. Venus won seven major singles championships, starting with Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2000 and ending with the 2008 Wimbledon title. And the two combined for 14 more Grand Slam doubles titles.\n\nWhen Gauff was awarded the key to the city of Delray Beach in 2018 at 14 years old, she said she dreamt of being \"the next Serena Williams.\" And her breakout win came in 2019 when she beat Venus in the first round at Wimbledon. The 15-year-old made it all the way to the Round of 16 that year.\n\nLike many star athletes, Coco Gauff is from an athletic family. Her dad, Corey Gauff, played college basketball at Georgia State from 1990 to 1993.\n\nHer mom, Candi Gauff, was a track star at Florida State from 1988 to 1992 when she was Candi Odom. She was also the South Florida Sun Sentinel's Athlete of the Year twice.\n\nCoco has two younger brothers, Codey and Cameron.\n\nNo. 3-ranked Coco Gauff plays No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the French Open semifinals no earlier than 9 a.m. ET on Thursday, June 6. Coverage from Roland Garros will start on the Tennis Channel, and NBC will jump in at 11 a.m. The whole tournament can be streamed on Peacock, and other streaming options include fuboTV, which offers a free trial to potential subscribers.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

The world No 1 has now ended the American's run in Paris for three years running, including in the 2022 final and last year's quarters.\n\nGauff made 39 unforced errors in the match, which proved decisive, as the 20-year-old dropped the first set 6-2 before briefly rallying in the second.\n\nIn the fourth game of the second set, Gauff returned a serve long just as it was called out, but Tourte overruled the decision and awarded the point to Swiatek.\n\nAn emotional Gauff was heard on court telling the umpire: \"You're wrong... you should be ashamed. It's a Grand Slam semi-final, know the rules of the game.\"\n\nDespite recovering to earn a first break of serve, Gauff then lost the next four games in a row.\n\nThe US Open champion staved off two match points as she stopped the rot to hold serve, forcing Swiatek to serve it out, but the two-time defending champion would do exactly that, clinching victory on her fourth match point to book her place in a third-straight French Open final.\n\nThe 23-year-old Pole is eyeing a fifth Grand Slam title, a fourth win in five years in Paris and is hoping to become the first woman to triumph three times in a row at Roland Garros since Justine Henin from 2007-09.\n\nIn the second semi-final, 17-year-old rising star Andreeva suffered a crushing 6-3 6-1 defeat to 12th seed Jasmine Paolini, who is through to a first Grand Slam final.\n\nAndreeva, the youngest slam semi-finalist since Martina Hingis at the US Open in 1997, failed to make the most of the few opportunities she had in the match, racking up too many unforced errors.\n\nShe had won her previous match against Paolini in Madrid in April, but the Italian used her booming forehand to devastating effect to wrap up a convincing victory on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe 28-year-old is the first Italian player to reach the final on the Paris clay since doubles partner Sara Errani in 2012, and her resounding victory came two days after compatriot Jannik Sinner made it to the last four in the men's draw, guaranteeing he would be world No 1 next week.\n\n\"It was a tough match,\" Paolini said afterwards. \"She's playing unbelievable - just 17 and so complete, so I was a little bit nervous before the match.\n\n\"I lost to her one month ago so I was like 'come on, you have to do better'. I was nervous in the first set but ball after ball I was getting relaxed.\n\n\"To dream is the most important thing in sport and in life, so I'm happy I could dream in this moment.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the third Grand Slam of 2024 - Wimbledon - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the grass-court season.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sara Errani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martina Hingis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/06/1600x900/skysports-iga-swiatek-french-open_6574912.jpg?20240606162626", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Gauff turned pro at the age of 14 and, among other, had Mike Tyson predicting big things for her before she wowed Roland Garros.\n\nOften said to be the new era's Venus and Serena Williams - her idols as a rising star - she even beat five-time Wimbledon champion Venus when she was just 15 in a 2019 third round match at the All-England club.

The 20-year-old has been the picture of consistency since winning the U.S. Open last year and is looking at home on the clay courts in Paris.

Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to 9Now or another website and watch the tennis.\n\nIf you're in the U.S. you have lots of options to watch a Swiatek vs Gauff live stream from Roland-Garros. Viewers can watch all the action on NBC and the Tennis Channel, as well as Peacock.\n\nNBC can be accessed with one of the best TV antennas, while the Tennis Channel is available in some cable packages.\n\nIf you've cut the cord and don't have cable, you can watch Swiatek vs Gauff via several live TV services, including NBC's own Peacock, plus Sling TV and Fubo.\n\nOf these options, we recommend Peacock.

Of these options, we recommend Sling and Fubo.\n\nBritish tennis lovers can watch Swiatek vs Gauff live streams from Roland-Garros with Discovery Plus and Eurosport.\n\nYou'll need to sign up to Discovery Plus' \u00a330.99-per-month Premium plan, which allows you to view TNT Sports live streams -- this includes the French Open as well as cycling Grand Tours, the Premier League and, later in the year, the Olympic Games.\n\nAll sounds great, right?

Due to the cost, we'd only recommend you stream via Stan if you're already a subscriber.\n\nNot in Australia right now? You can simply use a VPN, such as NordVPN, to watch all the action on your Stan account, as if you were back home.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adrian_back@tomsguide.com", "name": "Adrian Back", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9Now", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "9Now"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Potapova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anastasia Potapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NordVPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NordVPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free-to-air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nine Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

In the second set it was right because we were breaking each other,\" said Swiatek who is looking to win a third successive title at Roland Garros after her 6-2 6-4 win. \"I was consistent with my tactics and went for it.\n\n\"I think she [Gauff] is progressing a lot, you can see by her results. The US Open showed she is tough. At this age, it's kind of obvious she will grow. It's nice to see her handling things around her. Coco is one of the most consistent players out there.\n\n\"Something changed [after the match against Osaka]. I just adjusted better to the court. It's not easy to play the first matches at a Grand Slam because the atmosphere is different than other tournaments. Against Naomi Osaka, I didn't have chance to get into it. The weather changed and that helped my game.\"\n\nSwiatek quickly struck first blood with a break in the opening game. The 20-year-old American found some consistency early in the second set, moving 2-1 ahead on serve.\n\nGauff then became embroiled in a heated exchange with the chair umpire over the timing of a line call, exclaiming \"it's a Grand Slam semi-final, know the rules of the game\", while almost moved to tears.\n\nThat perceived injustice helped the American briefly raise her game, snatching her first break of the match after a long rally to lead 3-1, only to be pegged back immediately.\n\nThere was only going to be one outcome from then on as Swiatek reeled off four games in a row to take complete control.\n\nGauff dug deep, saving two match points to force Swiatek to serve it out and the Pole sealed victory on her fourth match point as another wild Gauff forehand flew well off target.\n\nMeanwhile, Novak Djokovic confirmed on Thursday he had undergone an operation on the right knee he injured during his last-16 win.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final against seventh seed Casper Ruud after a scan revealed a torn medial meniscus in his right knee.\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match,\" he posted on social media. \"I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well.\n\n\"My love for this sport is strong and the desire to compete at the highest level is what keeps me going.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old made no mention of whether he would be fit to take part at Wimbledon which begins on July 1 but added that he was going to \"do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\".\n\nDjokovic will also lose his status as the world No 1 with Italy's Jannik Sinner set to take his place. Australian Open champion Sinner faces Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open semi-finals on Friday.

On Thursday, June 6, Gauff made a heartbreaking exit from Roland Garros after losing the match 2-6, 4-6 at Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nIn the fourth game of the second set, Swiatek hit a serve that was called out but the umpire overruled it. Gauff missed the return and said that she hit the ball only after the line call was made. However, the umpire refused to agree.\n\nThe scenario became intense as boos echoed around the venue at Centre Court. After the umpire did not pay heed to her appeal, Gauff was seen in tears after which she returned to play.\n\nFrench Open 2024 Live Updates\n\n\"I didn't even finish my follow through. He called it before I hit it. Can you ask him?\" Gauff was heard saying.\n\n\"We cannot ask him,\" replied the umpire.\n\n\"They're booing because you're wrong... I have the right to finish my swing,\" Gauff replied.\n\nThe umpire said, \"To me it didn't affect the shot.\"\n\n\"This is the 2nd time this has happened. It's a Grand Slam Semi-final. Know the rules of the game,\" Gauff said.\n\nAs far as the match was concerned, Gauff was far from her very best, although she showed sparks of brilliance against the top-ranked player from Poland. Gauff found herself in all sorts of trouble after she dropped her serve twice in the first set as Swiatek dictated terms.\n\nGauff made 27 winners, 17 more than Swiatek's tally of 10. However, that she made 39 unforced errors in the match led to her downfall.

In the second set it was tight because we were breaking each other,\" said Swiatek.\n\n\"I was consistent with my tactics, didn't overthink stuff and just went for it in the end.\"\n\nSwiatek improved to 34-2 at the French Open after beating Gauff at Roland Garros for the third tournament in a row.\n\nShe has won all four of her previous Grand Slam finals and could become only the fourth woman to win four Roland Garros titles in the Open era -- after Justine Henin, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf.\n\nSwiatek is also on track to join Serena Williams as the only women to complete the treble of French, Madrid and Rome Open titles in the same year.\n\nRussian Andreeva, the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since Martina Hingis in 1997, takes on the unheralded Paolini in the other last-four encounter.\n\nAndreeva stole the headlines in the quarter-finals with a shock victory over world number two Aryna Sabalenka, who was hit by a stomach bug, becoming the youngest woman to reach a Slam semi-final since Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago.\n\nShe will now bid to back up that statement performance against 12th seed Paolini, who also got through with a surprise win against former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.\n\nBoth Andreeva and Paolini had never reached the quarters at a major tournament before this week, but are now just one match from the final.\n\nWith another win, Andreeva will also be the youngest Slam finalist since Hingis, who won the 1997 US Open aged 16.\n\nThe pair met for the only previous time earlier this year in the Madrid Open last 16, when Andreeva came out on top in two tight sets.\n\n\"I remember our match in Madrid. I remember that it was tough,\" said Andreeva. \"She played really good tennis, and after I was able to catch up a little bit.\n\n\"I'm sure that it will a great match.\"\n\nPaolini had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year, but the 28-year-old has been much improved in 2024, also reaching the Australian Open last 16.\n\n\"She's so young but she's so, so good mentally, and she can defend very well,\" Paolini said of her upcoming opponent.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough match, but we are in the semi-final, so there is no chance to get easy matches.\"\n\nDjokovic confirmed Thursday he had undergone an operation on his right knee he injured during his last-16 win.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final against Casper Ruud after a scan revealed a torn medial meniscus in his right knee.\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match,\" he posted on social media.\n\n\"I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old made no mention of whether he would be fit to take part at Wimbledon which begins on July 1 but added that he was going to \"do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\".", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com",

Poland's Swiatek, a three-time former French Open champion, stormed into the final with a straight sets defeat of her third-seeded rival, winning 6-2, 6-4 to move into Saturday's final.Under bright skies on Court Philippe Chatier, Swiatek took 1 hour and 37 minutes to get past American Gauff for the 11th time in their 12 career meetings. She is the third player since 2000 to make three consecutive French Open women's singles finals, joining Justine Henin (2005-2007) and Maria Sharapova (2012-2014).\n\nAfter a comfortable opening set in which she broke her opponent's service in the first and fifth games, Swiatek trailed 3-1 in the second only to win five of the last six games including a crucial break in the seventh game with a forehand winner as she closed in onto victory.\n\nThe Pole will face either Italy's Jasmine Paolini or Mirra Andreeva in the final as she hopes to win her fifth French Open women's singles title.\n\nBy defeating Gauff in the semifinal on Thursday, Swiatek has won 20 straight matches at the tournament, making her only the fifth woman in the Open Era to achieve this feat at Roland Garros. She joins Chris Evert (29 straight, 1984-1991), Monica Seles (25, 1990-1996), Justine Henin (24, 2005-2010), and Stefanie Graf (20, 1987-1989).\n\nThe 23-year-old Swiatek is also the second-youngest player in the Open Era to make four French Open finals, older only than Steffi Graf, who was 20 when she made her fourth Roland Garros final in 1990.\n\nSwiatek is also amid another lengthy clay-court winning streak, having now won 18 straight matches on the surface.

The winner will meet a Grand Slam final debutant in either teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva or Italian 12th seed Jasmine Paolini.\n\nThe 17-year-old Andreeva sent shockwaves through Paris with her scalp of second seed Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling three-setter and she is 15-2 for a major breakthrough while Paolini is 18-1 following her shock success over world number four Elena Rybakina.\n\nIga Swiatek v Coco Gauff predictions\n\nWorld number one Iga Swiatek is long odds-on to set up a shot at a fourth French Open crown with a semi-final victory over third seed Coco Gauff in a repeat of the 2022 final.\n\nSwiatek eased to a 6-1 6-3 success in the title-decider two years ago and, having won ten of their 11 meetings in straight sets, it is hard to make a case for Gauff overturning the form.\n\nThrow in the fact that Swiatek has won 17 consecutive matches on clay, winning titles in Madrid in Rome, and this looks like an intimidating duel for the American.\n\nThe Polish phenomenon needed three sets to shrug off the second-round challenge of Naomi Osaka but she has been utterly dominant since, particularly in her latest match-ups with Anastasia Potapova and 2019 runner-up Marketa Vondrousova.\n\nSwiatek double-bagelled Potapova in 41 minutes and then was rampant in a 6-0 6-2 drubbing of Vondrousova, sailing through in little over an hour.\n\nHaving dropped only three sets during her 17-match winning run, it is easy to see why a straight-sets Swiatek success is shortening all the time.\n\nBut that is perhaps a little disrespectful to Gauff, who claimed her maiden Grand Slam title at last season's US Open and is still improving.\n\nThe 20-year-old was far from disgraced when losing 6-4 6-3 to Swiatek in the Rome semi-finals last month and, for all of her struggles against the Pole, she has claimed at least six games in three of their four clay-court encounters.\n\nGauff showed great skill and composure having lost the opening set in her quarter-final against eighth seed Ons Jabeur, winning 4-6 6-2 6-3, and she may be able to offer stiffer resistance than many expect.\n\nJasmine Paolini v Mirra Andreeva predictions\n\nFew would have predicted this semi-final following the quarter-final draw but Andreeva is a unique talent and can highlight her promise with the biggest win of her career.\n\nIt is no surprise to see Andreeva competing in the last four of a Grand Slam but it is a shock to see it happening so soon, with the 17-year-old featuring in a major for only the fifth time.\n\nThe teenage talent came from a set down to defeat world number two Sabalenka, playing on the front foot and carving out 14 break-point opportunities to the Belarusian's six, and there should be no concern about her having to settle down against another Grand Slam semi-finalist debutant.\n\nPaolini also caused a stir in the last eight, showing great composure to fend off the challenge of Rybakina in three sets, but the Kazakh was punished for too many unforced errors.\n\nBoth have an aggressive style of play and the match will be determined by who hits the most winners, but Andreeva's added power and height gives her the edge.\n\nThis is unlikely to be the last time we see Andreeva's name in a Grand Slam semi-final and her 7-6 6-4 success over Paolini in Madrid in April should give her the necessary confidence to express herself on the biggest stage.\n\nClick for more free bets and betting offers from the Racing Post", "source": {"uri": "racingpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "racingpost.com"},

Gauff, who will ascend to world number two next week, faced her 11th defeat in 12 matches against Swiatek, all in straight sets.\n\nThe American's frustration boiled over during the match, resulting in a heated exchange with the chair umpire.\n\nSwiatek's dominance on the court puts her in contention to join an elite group of players, including Henin, Chris Evert, and Steffi Graf, as one of the few women to claim four Roland Garros titles in the Open era.\n\nMoreover, she is on track to emulate Serena Williams by completing the treble of French, Madrid, and Rome Open titles in the same year.\n\nDespite Gauff's valiant efforts, Swiatek's superior performance proved insurmountable as she secured her place in the final, setting the stage for a thrilling conclusion to the French Open.

I obviously won that game,\" added the 20-year-old Gauff, who will become world number two next week.\n\n\"I usually don't get too frustrated with decisions like that, but I think it was just a combination of everything going on in the moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2024/06/06/18/0ff4628e3a67ace047ca9c0e8bed6e7a.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Only eight days ago Iga Swiatek was down and very nearly out against an inspired Naomi Osaka in the second round, coming from 5-2 behind in the final set and saving a match point to keep her bid for a third consecutive French Open title alive.\n\nBut instead of that narrow escape putting any doubt in the world No 1's mind, it has had the opposite effect. She has treated her opponents with utter disdain since, conceding only eight games in three matches (half of those six sets have been won 6-0), and she made Marketa Vondrousova look like a world No 500 rather than a reigning Wimbledon champion in the 6-0, 6-2 quarter-final rout.\n\nYesterday's results gave her even more momentum when her toughest rivals on tour, Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina, were bundled out in the other half of the draw. Swiatek knows that if she gets past Coco Gauff in their semi-final today - and the chances are that she will given this is a profitable match-up for her, having beaten the American in 10 of their 11 meetings - she'll be the overwhelming favourite in Saturday's final against Mirra Andreeva or Jasmine Paolini.\n\nBut making this all about Swiatek would do a disservice to Gauff - and Andreeva and Paolini. There has been so much to like about Gauff this tournament, especially the way she dealt with a resurgent Ons Jabeur in her gutsy three-set comeback win on Tuesday. Gauff - still only 20 - will be the new world No 2 next week, a reward for the supreme consistency she has achieved since winning the US Open last year. And Andreeva and Paolini deserve plenty of credit for the way they overcame their far more illustrious opponents yesterday; one of them will now reach their first slam final.\n\nSwiatek knows this title is now hers for the taking, which would make her only the third woman to win three successive Roland Garros titles in the Open era after Monica Seles in 1990-92 and Justine Henin in 2005-07. But yesterday's shockwaves are still reverberating around Roland Garros, and they serve as a reminder that nothing is guaranteed. And that, of course, is why we watch.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katy_murrells@theguardian.com", "name": "Katy Murrells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monica Seles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World_Building", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World Building", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6886de2e0d7c995436fdab829416c97e10da422c/0_117_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&s=c3994edef6bc8a121f4f0abc3303fde7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Ahead of their French Open semifinal clash on Thursday, Swiatek anticipates a tough challenge from Gauff.\n\nGauff's solitary victory over Swiatek occurred on a hardcourt at Cincinnati last year, where she triumphed in a three-set thriller en route to claiming her first WTA 1000 title. This victory also set the stage for her maiden Grand Slam win at the U.S. Open.\n\nDespite Gauff's recent successes, Swiatek has emerged victorious in their last three encounters, all in straight sets. The Polish star, however, respects Gauff's ability and is wary of her opponent, particularly after ending the 20-year-old's hopes at Roland Garros in the 2022 final and quarterfinal s last year.\n\n\"I think her mental game is a little bit better. Before, it was kind of easier to 'crack her' when you were leading,\" Swiatek said of Gauff.\n\n\"But it's normal that she's making progress. She's at that age that everything goes pretty nicely, that if you're working hard then you will get progress.\n\n\"She's doing that and probably every aspect of her game is a little bit better because it's different being a teenager on the tour and then being a more mature player.\"\n\nEver since Swiatek survived a scare against Naomi Osaka in the second round, the Pole has brushed aside opponents with ease, serving up a double bagel win over Anastasia Potapova and thrashing Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.\n\nSwiatek's last win over Gauff came on clay in the semifinal s of the Italian Open last month and the American said she has to \"find a better way\" to play the world No. 1 who has won her last 17 matches.\n\n\"I've obviously been unsuccessful the last couple of times we've played, regardless of the surface and anything. She's definitely a tough opponent for me and for anybody,\" Gauff said.\n\n\"I just have to go back and watch, try to find what I have to do. I think she's playing great tennis here, so it's going to be a challenge, but I'm going to go into the match with a lot of belief that I can.\n\n\"I'm going to try to get a plan from my team and then also my own plan and see where we can find a blend.\"\n\nWith Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka both suffering upsets in the quarterfinal s, the other last-four clash features Italy's 12th seed Jasmine Paolini playing Russia's unseeded teenager Mirra Andreeva.\n\nA semifinal at a major is uncharted territory for both players and a remarkable achievement for Andreeva, who is the youngest Grand Slam semifinal ist in nearly three decades after former world No. 1 Martina Hingis.\n\nThe pair met in Madrid where Andreeva came out on top in the last-16 - the only meeting between the two players.\n\n\"It was really tough mentally and game-wise. She plays really fast and moves really fast. She goes for it, it doesn't matter what the situation or score is,\" Andreeva said.\n\n\"It'll be a bit like today.

She also owns a 2-0 head-to-head record over Paolini.\n\nSwiatek has not lost at Roland Garros in three years.\n\nThe top-ranked player in the world conquered the clay in 2020, 2022 and 2023. Her only loss in that span came in the 2021 quarterfinals to Maria Sakkari.\n\nSwiatek won the French Open final in straight sets in 2020 and 2022. She was taken to three sets by Karolina Muchova last June.\n\nThe four-time major winner won at least one set by a 6-1 or 6-2 margin in each of her three French Open finals.\n\nShe also happens to be perfect in Grand Slam finals. She is 4-0 with three triumphs in Paris and a win from the 2022 U.S. Open.\n\nSwiatek has been as dominant as usual this year in Paris. She dropped a single set in the second round to Naomi Osaka.\n\nShe eliminated a pair of top-five seeds, Marketa Vondrousova and Coco Gauff, by a combined score of 24-8 in the last two rounds.\n\nPaolini has an uphill climb not just to win the match, but to take a few games in each set off Swiatek.\n\nThe 12th-seeded Italian won six games in four career sets against Swiatek. They met in Prague in 2018 and at the 2022 U.S. Open.\n\nPaolini had not been past the fourth round at any Grand Slam singles event prior to the French Open. Her previous best finish came at the 2024 Australian Open.\n\nPaolini knocked out No. 4 seed Elena Rybakina and teenage phenom Mirra Andreeva in the last two rounds to get into the final.\n\nThe three-set quarterfinal win over Rybakina is the best comparison to the type of match she will see against Swiatek.\n\nThat victory combined with her overall form could give Paolini some confidence going into Saturday, but even if she plays a perfect match, she might not compare to Swiatek's peak level.\n\nAnything other than a straight-set win from Swiatek would be viewed as a surprise result.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_tansey@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joe Tansey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Muchov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sakkari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sakkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1717691001/qaq72hh1usx6xxvqzpqm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

In the second set it was tight because we were breaking each other,\" said Swiatek.\n\n\"I was consistent with my tactics, didn't overthink stuff and just went for it in the end.\"\n\nSwiatek improved to 34-2 at the French Open after beating Gauff at Roland Garros for the third tournament in a row.\n\nShe has won all four of her previous Grand Slam finals and could become only the fourth woman to win four Roland Garros titles in the Open era -- after Justine Henin, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf.\n\nSwiatek is also on track to join Serena Williams as the only women to complete the treble of French, Madrid and Rome Open titles in the same year.\n\n- Surprise semi-finalists -\n\nRussian Andreeva, the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since Martina Hingis in 1997, takes on the unheralded Paolini in the other last-four encounter.\n\nAndreeva stole the headlines in the quarter-finals with a shock victory over world number two Aryna Sabalenka, who was hit by a stomach bug, becoming the youngest woman to reach a Slam semi-final since Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago.\n\nMore from this section Mostly sunny and warm conditions; scattered showers, storms return midweek for the Bronx Bank of Canada cuts interest rate, hints there could be more The Negative Impact of Teen Internet Addiction on Brain Function\n\nShe will now bid to back up that statement performance against 12th seed Paolini, who also got through with a surprise win against former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.\n\nBoth Andreeva and Paolini had never reached the quarters at a major tournament before this week, but are now just one match from the final.\n\nWith another win, Andreeva will also be the youngest Slam finalist since Hingis, who won the 1997 US Open aged 16.\n\nThe pair met for the only previous time earlier this year in the Madrid Open last 16, when Andreeva came out on top in two tight sets.\n\n\"I remember our match in Madrid. I remember that it was tough,\" said Andreeva. \"She played really good tennis, and after I was able to catch up a little bit.\n\n\"I'm sure that it will a great match.\"\n\nPaolini had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year, but the 28-year-old has been much improved in 2024, also reaching the Australian Open last 16.\n\n\"She's so young but she's so, so good mentally, and she can defend very well,\" Paolini said of her upcoming opponent.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough match, but we are in the semi-final, so there is no chance to get easy matches.\"\n\nDjokovic confirmed Thursday he had undergone an operation on his right knee he injured during his last-16 win.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final against Casper Ruud after a scan revealed a torn medial meniscus in his right knee.\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match,\" he posted on social media.\n\n\"I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old made no mention of whether he would be fit to take part at Wimbledon which begins on July 1 but added that he was going to \"do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\".\n\nmw/jc", "source": {"uri":

In the second set it was tight because we were breaking each other,\" said Swiatek.\n\n\"I was consistent with my tactics, didn't overthink stuff and just went for it in the end.\"\n\nSwiatek improved to 34-2 at the French Open after beating Gauff at Roland Garros for the third tournament in a row.\n\nShe has won all four of her previous Grand Slam finals and could become only the fourth woman to win four Roland Garros titles in the Open era -- after Justine Henin, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf.\n\nSwiatek is also on track to join Serena Williams as the only women to complete the treble of French, Madrid and Rome Open titles in the same year.\n\nSurprise semi-finalists\n\nRussian Andreeva, the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since Martina Hingis in 1997, takes on the unheralded Paolini in the other last-four encounter.\n\nAndreeva stole the headlines in the quarter-finals with a shock victory over world number two Aryna Sabalenka, who was hit by a stomach bug, becoming the youngest woman to reach a Slam semi-final since Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago.\n\nShe will now bid to back up that statement performance against 12th seed Paolini, who also got through with a surprise win against former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.\n\nBoth Andreeva and Paolini had never reached the quarters at a major tournament before this week, but are now just one match from the final.\n\nWith another win, Andreeva will also be the youngest Slam finalist since Hingis, who won the 1997 US Open aged 16.\n\nThe pair met for the only previous time earlier this year in the Madrid Open last 16, when Andreeva came out on top in two tight sets.\n\n\"I remember our match in Madrid. I remember that it was tough,\" said Andreeva. \"She played really good tennis, and after I was able to catch up a little bit.\n\n\"I'm sure that it will a great match.\"\n\nPaolini had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year, but the 28-year-old has been much improved in 2024, also reaching the Australian Open last 16.\n\n\"She's so young but she's so, so good mentally, and she can defend very well,\" Paolini said of her upcoming opponent.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough match, but we are in the semi-final, so there is no chance to get easy matches.\"\n\nDjokovic confirmed Thursday he had undergone an operation on his right knee he injured during his last-16 win.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final against Casper Ruud after a scan revealed a torn medial meniscus in his right knee.\n\n\"In the past day, I had to make some tough decisions after sustaining a meniscus tear during my last match,\" he posted on social media.\n\n\"I'm still processing it all but I am happy to update you that the surgery went well.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old made no mention of whether he would be fit to take part at Wimbledon which begins on July 1 but added that he was going to \"do my best to be healthy and fit to return to the court as soon as possible\".", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType":

Before it was kind of easier to 'crack her' when you were leading,\" Swiatek said of Gauff.\n\n\"But it's normal that she's making progress. She's at that age that everything goes pretty nicely, that if you're working hard then you will get progress.\n\n\"She's doing that and probably every aspect of her game is a little bit better because it's different being a teenager on the tour and then being a more mature player.\"\n\nEver since Swiatek survived a scare against Naomi Osaka in the second round, the Pole has brushed aside opponents with ease, serving up a double bagel win over Anastasia Potapova and thrashing Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.\n\nSwiatek's last win over Gauff came on clay in the semi-finals of the Italian Open last month and the American said she has to \"find a better way\" to play the world number one who has won her last 17 matches.\n\n\"I've obviously been unsuccessful the last couple of times we've played, regardless of the surface and anything. She's definitely a tough opponent for me and for anybody,\" Gauff said.\n\n\"I just have to go back and watch, try to find what I have to do. I think she's playing great tennis here, so it's going to be a challenge, but I'm going to go into the match with a lot of belief that I can.\n\n\"I'm going to try to get a plan from my team and then also my own plan and see where we can find a blend.\"\n\nWith Elena Rybakina and Aryna Sabalenka both suffering upsets in the quarter-finals, the other last-four clash features Italy's 12th seed Jasmine Paolini playing Russia's unseeded teenager Mirra Andreeva.\n\nA semi-final at a major is uncharted territory for both players and a remarkable achievement for Andreeva, who is the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist in nearly three decades after former world number one Martina Hingis.\n\nThe pair met in Madrid where Andreeva came out on top in the last-16 -- the only meeting between the two players.\n\n\"It was really tough mentally and game-wise. She plays really fast and moves really fast. She goes for it, it doesn't matter what the situation or score is,\" Andreeva said.\n\n\"It'll be a bit like today. I'll try to play the same level and with the same cool head. We'll see what will happen.\"\n\nReporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru Editing by Toby Davis\n\nRohith Nair\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nRohith reports on soccer, tennis, cricket, MotoGP and many more sports.

Our French Open final preview and prediction", "body": "Iga Swiatek will face Jasmine Paolini on Court Philippe Chatrier this Saturday, with the French Open title at stake.\n\nFor Swiatek, this is familiar territory; she is in a fourth final in the space of five years at Roland Garros, and a fifth Grand Slam final overall.\n\nBut Paolini had never even played in a Grand Slam quarter-final before this tournament, and she will look to emulate Francesca Schiavone and become the second Italian woman to win the title here.\n\nWe take a look into how both women got to this stage, the key things to watch - and make our prediction.\n\nSwiatek's road to a third Roland Garros final has been defined by one match: her round two contest against Naomi Osaka.\n\nThe world No 1 battled from the brink of defeat in that clash, saving a match point to prevail 7-6(1), 1-6, 7-5 against her fellow four-time Slam winner.\n\nPerhaps spurred on by that encounter, she has been dominant since then, dropping only 14 games across her next four matches.\n\nSwiatek overcame Marie Bouzkova 6-4, 6-2 in the third round, before double-bagelling Anastasia Potapova to reach the last eight.\n\nJust two games were dropped in her quarter-final against Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, and she then dispatched US Open champion Coco Gauff 6-2, 6-4 to return to the final.\n\nIga Swiatek ties incredible Martina Navratilova record with Coco Gauff French Open victory\n\nUndoubtedly one to watch pre-tournament after a strong season, Paolini's campaign started with straight-set triumphs over Daria Saville and Hailey Baptiste.\n\nUp next in round three, she faced a tough test in the form of Bianca Andreescu, the 2019 US Open winner who is always tough to beat - even on the comeback from injury.\n\nBut Paolini held firm in a battling 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 triumph, and then came from a set down to beat Elina Avanesyan and reach the last eight.\n\nThere, the 12th seed caused one of the biggest shocks of the tournament, downing world No 4 Elena Rybakina 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 to reach the last four.\n\nAnd she was a class apart in her semi-final, fending off a nervy Mirra Andreeva in straight sets to reach the biggest match of her career.\n\nJannik Sinner and Jasmine Paolini lead Italian tennis surge that shows no signs of slowing down\n\nThis will be the third meeting between the two, and both prior encounters have been won comfortably by Swiatek.\n\nIt has been six years since their first encounter, a round of 16 contest in Prague the Pole won 6-2, 6-1 to reach the quarter-final.\n\nThe pair then met again at the US Open in 2022, Swiatek picking up a comprehensive 6-3, 6-0 win in round one - on her way to the title.\n\nPaolini has improved massively since that second encounter, but has she improved enough to turn this match-up around completely?\n\nThe Pole is in her fifth Grand Slam final and, with a 4-0 record at this stage of a major, she certainly knows how to handle such occasions.\n\nShe has a huge experience advantage in this contest, and may well count for something.\n\nSwiatek has a hugely intense style of play and this is even more noticeable in bigger matches; she loves to rush her opponents even more, suffocating them with relentless ballstriking and rapid movement around the court.\n\nThe three-time Roland Garros winner will look to rush Paolini and make this experience as mentally demanding as possible for the 12th seed.\n\nAt 5'4, the Italian is never going to be a huge hitter, and she will need to defend her serve incredibly well throughout this contest.\n\nBut her forehand is a strong shot and one with a surprising amount of kick considering her stature, and using this effectively is imperative for her chances.\n\nThis was the shot that saw her hit a surprising amount of winners against Rybakina in their quarter-final and also saw her completely dictate her contest versus Andreeva.\n\nShe will look to use this frequently throughout the final - and deflect from her serve and her backhand, which possesses nowhere near as much power.\n\nSwiatek is an overwhelming favourite for this match, and it is hard to see how Paolini will stop her on Saturday.\n\nThe Pole has been in relentless form and after a near-flawless clay season, it is impossible to pick against her in this final.\n\nPaolini will give it a good go, but Swiatek should win a fifth major title.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Paolini", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Paolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bouzkov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marie Bouzkov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Schiavone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francesca Schiavone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Potapova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anastasia Potapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elina_Avanesyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elina Avanesyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria_Saville", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daria Saville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailey_Baptiste", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hailey Baptiste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Navratilova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martina Navratilova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianca_Andreescu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bianca Andreescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F06180648%2FJasmine-Paolini-vs-Iga-Swiatek-USE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Her win-loss record at Slams this year is 8-1.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rajdeep_saha@newsbytesapp.com", "name": "Rajdeep Saha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l54320240606201808.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Here's how Twitter reacted", "body": "The Delray Beach, Florida native, who will rise to No. 2 in the WTA rankings, shed some tears as she composed herself after a questionable call during her straight-sets loss to Swiatek, the three-time champion at Roland Garros.\n\nGauff mishit a return on Swiatek's serve during the second set, but the serve was called out by the line judge. The chair umpire overruled that call, saying Gauff made contact before the serve was called out. The 20-year-old U.S. Open champion had a heated exchange with the chair umpire, and cameras caught her afterward crying as she focused to get back into the match.\n\nHere's the exchange, as recorded by The Tennis Letter on Twitter:\n\nGauff: \"I didn't even finish my follow through. He called it before I hit it. Can you ask him?\"\n\nUmpire: \"We cannot ask him.\"\n\nGauff: \"They're booing because you're wrong ... I have the right to finish my swing.\"\n\nUmpire: \"To me it didn't affect the shot.\"\n\nGauff: \"This is the second time this has happened. It's a grand slam semifinal. Know the rules of the game.\"\n\nThe American star did compose herself, rallying to break Swiatek's serve and mount a comeback attempt that fell short in a 6-2, 6-4 loss. Swiatek advanced to her third straight French Open final. This was Gauff's third straight grand slam semifinal appearance, a streak that started with her winning the 2023 U.S. Open.\n\nTennis Twitter reacts to Coco Gauff French Open match\n\nTennis fans following the match on social media were not pleased with how the umpire handled the situation.

She gets in and out of the corners better than any player, including most male players, too,\" the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion said.\n\n\"She just has an understanding of the court and a comfort level that players don't have in her game naturally. You know, it was more effective.\n\n\"Obviously, she can play on other surfaces. She's still learning, maybe on grass. She's still learning to hone her skills at the net. But you don't need some of that here. And so what she brings is an intensity, and a level that most players can't match.\n\n\"Off the ground, she can take the ball early. She can play defence when she needs to. So, she's extremely difficult to beat.\n\n\"It'd be surprising if she doesn't win three or four more of them at least. We'll see what happens. But she certainly knows what she's doing on this court.\n\n\"Iga wants to be like Rafa, obviously, who wouldn't on clay? She's doing pretty good so far, winning three out of four French Opens.\n\n\"I certainly don't think anyone's going to do what Rafa did, but then again, I didn't think anyone would do what Bjorn did when he won six out of eight. Who knows?\n\n\"But when you're expected to win every time, that's a different pressure. I picked her to win, but there are players still in that could beat her, so it's going to be interesting.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_west@tennis365.com", "name": "Ewan West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEnroe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John McEnroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F06121030%2FIga-Swiatek-and-John-McEnroe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

I want to do the same thing'.\"\n\nWhen Gauff was nine, she was cast as the body double for a young Serena, while she also had a poster of the tennis icon on her bedroom wall.\n\nHowever, it is ironically the latter's older sister Venus who has played the more significant role in Gauff's professional career.\n\nGauff's journey to the top of her sport started at seven when she moved to Florida from Georgia to pursue her tennis dream.\n\nA year later she won her first international tournament and became the youngest girl to make a US Open Girls Final at 13 years old.\n\nHer mainstream breakthrough came just two years after that when she entered Wimbledon as a wild card entrant at rank 272nd.\n\nGauff had to make it through came through three rounds of qualifying to reach the main draw all while juggling taking a science test the night before her matches.\n\n\"I ended up getting a B on the exam, which was pretty good, considering I took it at 11 at night and I had to wake up the next day for a match,\" Gauff told CNN.\n\n\"After my science test, I guess some of my teachers saw the interview,\" she added. \"Before that ... only one teacher knew I play tennis, and I don't think they knew I was pro. And now all of them except one know I play and they're all cheering me on.\"\n\nGauff then stunned the world by beating former champ Venus Williams 6-4 6-4 in her Grand Slam singles debut in the first round.\n\nDespite that triumph, Gauff is still waiting on her first Grand Slam four years later after admitting the hype around her took its toll.\n\n\"Throughout my life, I was always the youngest to do things, which added hype that I didn't want,\" Gauff wrote in a post for Behind The Racquet in 2020.\n\n\"It added this pressure that I needed to do well fast. Once I let that all go, that when I started to have the results I wanted.\n\n\"Right before Wimbledon, going back to around 2017/18, I was struggling to figure out if this was really what I wanted.\n\n\"I always had the results so that wasn't the issue, I just found myself not enjoying what I loved.\n\n\"I realised I needed to start playing for myself and not other people. For about a year I was really depressed. That was the toughest year for me so far.\n\n\"Even though I had, it felt like there weren't many friends there for me.\n\n\"When you are in that dark mindset you don't look on the bright side of things too often, which is the hardest part.\n\n\"I don't think it had much to do with tennis, maybe just about juggling it all. I knew that I wanted to play tennis but didn't know how I wanted to go about it.\n\n\"It went so far that I was thinking about possibly taking a year off to just focus on life.\n\n\"Choosing not to obviously was the right choice but I was close to not going in that direction.\"\n\nGauff has since refocused and has enjoyed the best spell of her career having added Andy Murray's former coach Brad Gilbert to her camp.\n\nShe is now two wins away from her second Grand Slam title after her stunning victory in Flushing Meadows, New York in 2023.\n\nOn her partnership with the 62-year-old, she revealed: \"I was worried about being with the older person, to be honest, before I met Brad.\n\n\"He's older but he still has the mind of, like, a 20-year-old, maybe even younger, a 10-year-old kid sometimes. The guy has offered me Jolly Ranchers.

Obviously, I'm losing the match,\" Gauff told reporters.\n\n\"When you're playing against her every point matters... against anybody, but especially against her. I think it was just one of those moments, but I overcame it. I won that game.\n\n\"So I usually don't get too frustrated with decisions like that, but I think it was just a combination of everything going on in the moment.\"\n\nGauff is not the first player to call for technology to help officials, as Briton Cameron Norrie said video replays should be in use after he got away with a double bounce during his second round victory over Lucas Pouille at Roland Garros last year.\n\nThe U.S. Open became the first Grand Slam to use the system at last year's tournament with video reviews generating positive feedback at the various ATP events at which it is used.\n\n\"Tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times decisions are made by one person. In other sports there are usually multiple referees making a decision,\" Gauff said.\n\n\"I know the U.S. Open brought some of it last year. I know we used it in our doubles at one point. I definitely think it's almost ridiculous we don't have it. Not just speaking because that happened to me, but I just think every sport has it.\n\n\"Also, there are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right, and it's, like, what does that give you in that moment?\n\n\"In situations you can call for the supervisor, but there's not much they can do from that standpoint. I definitely think as a sport we have to evolve, and we have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Paris Editing by Toby Davis)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pouille", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Pouille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629068", "eventUri": "eng-9629068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 30, "textEnd": 36}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

And it's, like: What does that give you in that moment?\"\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open in September for her first Grand Slam title, disagreed with chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte's decision early in the second set of Swiatek's 6-2, 6-4 victory. Swiatek hit a serve that initially was called out at around the same time as Gauff was swinging to hit a return, which landed out. The call on the serve itself was reversed to \"In,\" and Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek; Gauff said that was unfair because she thought she was affected by the original \"Out\" call.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I think it was just one of those moments, but I overcame it. I obviously won that game,\" Gauff said. \"I usually don't get too frustrated with decisions like that, but I think it was just a combination of everything going on in the moment.\"\n\nGauff did break Swiatek for the only time in the match right then for a 3-1 lead in the set. But Swiatek would take five of the next six games to reach another final at Roland Garros, where she is seeking a third consecutive trophy and fourth in five years.\n\nAs for the larger issue of whether Tourte should have been able to examine some sort of replay to figure out whether the line judge's shout did affect things, Gauff had zero doubt about her stance.\n\n\"I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the (video replay) system ... (and) in other sports, there's usually multiple refs making a decision,\" Gauff said, noting that the U.S. Open did add replays for certain calls last year. \"I definitely think, as a sport, we have to evolve. And have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it.\"\n\nSwiatek agreed with the basic premise, saying, \"It would be easier to have the replay,\" but added: \"I don't know how it would look, like, logistically.

And it's, like: What does that give you in that moment?\"\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open in September for her first Grand Slam title, disagreed with chair umpire Aur\u00e9lie Tourte's decision early in the second set of Swiatek's 6-2, 6-4 victory. Swiatek hit a serve that initially was called out at around the same time as Gauff was swinging to hit a return, which landed out. The call on the serve itself was reversed to \"In,\" and Tourte awarded the point to Swiatek; Gauff said that was unfair because she thought she was affected by the original \"Out\" call.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I think it was just one of those moments, but I overcame it. I obviously won that game,\" Gauff said. \"I usually don't get too frustrated with decisions like that, but I think it was just a combination of everything going on in the moment.\"\n\nGauff did break Swiatek for the only time in the match right then for a 3-1 lead in the set. But Swiatek would take five of the next six games to reach another final at Roland Garros, where she is seeking a third consecutive trophy and fourth in five years.\n\nAs for the larger issue of whether Tourte should have been able to examine some sort of replay to figure out whether the line judge's shout did affect things, Gauff had zero doubt about her stance.\n\n\"I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the (video replay) system ... (and) in other sports, there's usually multiple refs making a decision,\" Gauff said, noting that the U.S. Open did add replays for certain calls last year. \"I definitely think, as a sport, we have to evolve. And have the technology. They're showing it on TV, so I don't get why the player can't see it.\"\n\nSwiatek agreed with the basic premise, saying, \"It would be easier to have the replay,\" but added: \"I don't know how it would look, like, logistically. When can you ask an umpire to (show) a video replay or (whether) it's up to her to do that. Because I think the umpire today was pretty sure with her call.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

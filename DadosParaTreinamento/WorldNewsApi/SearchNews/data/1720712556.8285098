{"id": 232038922, "title": "Local and European elections 2024: Leitrim County Council first to complete count \u2013 while some counting pauses", "text": "Monaghan County Council With the election of four councillors and completion of the count in Monaghan Municipal District, thirteen out of eighteen seats on Monaghan County Council have now been filled. There will be close finishes in the other two Monaghan municipal districts with both Sinn F\u00e9in and Fine Gael hoping to be the main winners at the end. Fianna F\u00e1il will be disappointed with its showing in north Monaghan where it increased its first preference votes by 6% (almost 700) yet ended up with just one councillor from its three candidates.Monaghan LEA Seventh count: ELECTED: SE\u00c1N CONLON (SF) PAURIC CLERKIN (FG) BRONAGH MCAREE (SF) DAVID MAXWELL (FG) The Monaghan LEA contest saw the election of first time candidate for Fine Gael, Pauric Clerkin, who works for Minister Heather Humphreys, one of three councillors elected without reaching the quota after Sinn F\u00e9in's Sean Conlon had been re-elected. Conlon brought in his colleague Bronagh McAree from Emyvale, one of the new faces in the party team. Sinn F\u00e9in is hoping to increase its overall tally of seats on the council from six to eight. It depends on the result in Carrickmacross Castleblayney where one of their new candidates is hoping to topple outgoing Fiann F\u00e1il member Aoife McCooey, who has just finished a term as Cathaoirleach of the municipal district. In 2019 she won the seat by just nineteen votes over a veteran Sinn F\u00e9in councillor. Now Sinn F\u00e9in will be hoping to regain that seat. Ballybay Clones LEAFourth Count: ELECTED: SEAN GILLILAND (FG) In Ballybay Clones with two seats remaining to be filled Sinn F\u00e9in are hoping for a victory for their candidate Sinead Flynn, one of several new faces in the party line-up who is 152 votes short of a quota. Along with Pat Treanor (outgoing) who is 71 votes behind her, this would give them two of the five seats there, a gain of one. Outgoing Fine Gael member Sean Gilliland a former Garda needed just one vote to get him across the line and has just been elected on the fourth count, joining his party colleague Richard Truell. In Monaghan MD Sinn F\u00e9in have retained their three seats, so if the final results in the other two districts go their way the shape of the incoming Council will look like this: SF 8 (up 2); FG 6 (up 1); FF 3 (down 1); Independent 1 (down 2). Carrickmacross Castleblayney LEA Sixth Count: No-one elected. Aoife Kindlon (SF) was excluded with 797 votes to be transferred so her two party colleagues Noel Keelan and Paul Gibbons will expect to benefit as a result. If Gibbons (sitting at 1042 votes) sees off the challenge of Aoife McCooey of FF (now at 876 votes) then SF will have half of the six seats in this area and will be on course for winning eight seats overall.Michael Fisher", "summary": "<tickaroo>{\n  \"themeId\": \"lct_653b7fa7fed115003648bab8\",\n  \"clientId\": \"64772ae4d1d7dec0c5b716af\",\n  \"liveblogId\": \"66629cc432bbc2726ccd5013\"\n}</tickaroo>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elections-2024/local-and-european-elections-2024-leitrim-county-council-first-to-complete-count-while-some-counting-pauses-for-the-match/a1657554728.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/u0wSfsmbQtc1e5ywkvcsMRdFFiY=/60x0:735x450/629x0/prod-mh-ireland/13232520-33da-4a51-91ec-ed855cf3b618/e80bce29-1b5f-4be7-a3f3-6a4dd0bc42c2/video/video.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:29:34", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.251}

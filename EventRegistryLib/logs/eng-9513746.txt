He struck out 18 times and did not connect on a home run as his ground-ball rate rose and his line-drive production shrunk while he continued to correct mechanical issues.\n\nIn a move described as the \"best\" solution for the young hitter, Walker was optioned to Triple-A Memphis on Wednesday ahead of the Cardinals' series finale against the Diamondbacks.\n\n\"A lot of discussion around it,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said of Walker's demotion. \"And in thinking what's best for Jordan at the moment for continuing his development, going down into a lower-stakes environment and working on the things that he's been trying to work on over the last several weeks here made the most sense.\"\n\nAdjustments with his swing and with pitch selection will be focuses for Walker. He is expected to continue working on mechanical changes for the next two to three days before he makes his way into a minor league game.\n\nSimilar to his April demotion last season after opening the season as St. Louis' starting right fielder, Walker's ground-ball tendency was an issue the Cardinals felt needed to be addressed. Through 20 games this season, Walker produced a 50% ground-ball rate while his 4.8% line-drive rate was more than 10% lower than it was in 2023 and was the second-lowest among players with a minimum of 60 plate appearances entering Wednesday, per FanGraphs.\n\nAgainst breaking pitches, which accounted for 38.2% of the pitches he saw, the second-year slugger had a .150 batting average and a 42.9% swing-and-miss rate, per Statcast. His 37.5% hard-hit rate against breaking pitches was the lowest among pitch groups Walker saw, while the 73.9% chase-miss rate was the highest. Those struggles included making contact on pitches located low and away.\n\n\"I think they go hand in hand,\" Marmol said when asked if the swing issues and pitch selection are connected. \"They don't have to, but I think one amplifies the other. It's hard to stay connected and do what you want to do from a posture standpoint in holding your backside. Some of the things that he's been working on and (keeping) that while swinging at a pitch that is down and away, it's not great. Being able to get the pitch closer to him (and) lay off of that but also even with pitches in the zone, being able to make the move he wants to make with his body.\"\n\nWith Walker in Memphis, utility Gold Glover Brendan Donovan may be used as a regular outfielder for \"the time being,\" Marmol said. There may be more at-bats at the DH spot than previously expected for catchers Willson Contreras and Ivan Herrera as well for outfielder Alec Burleson while Walker looks to swing his way back into the majors.\n\n\"I mean, if he's not going to be in the lineup every day at his age, then the best thing for Jordan Walker is to go down and play every day and get to where he needs to get to,\" Marmol said.\n\nThompson heads to Memphis\n\nAlong with Walker's option to Class AAA, the Cardinals optioned left-hander Zack Thompson to Memphis. Lefty John King and infielder Jose Fermin were recalled in corresponding moves and joined the big league club on Wednesday.\n\nThompson, 26, is expected to join Memphis' rotation to be built up to 85 to 95 pitches in order to be ready for a start in the majors if needed. The consistent role will also allow him to work on issues that have caused his velocity to take dips after he posted a 9.53 ERA in 17 innings to begin the year.\n\n\"Regardless of last night's outing, today would have been the day we made a decision on him either way. ... He needs to get stretched out and get back into throwing 85 (to) 95 pitches per outing and getting enough touches where he's working on the things he needs to work on,\" Marmol said. \"We can't expect him to be sharp out of the 'pen and see a tick up in (velocity) if he's not actually having an opportunity to work on those things.\"\n\nTribute to Whitey\n\nAs a tribute to Hall of Fame manager Whitey Herzog, the Cardinals will soon affix a No. 24 patch to the sleeves of their jerseys for the rest of the 2024 season, an executive with the team confirmed. The circular patch will feature Herzog's name and his retired No. 24, and it will look similar to past memorials the Cardinals have worn.\n\nThe team consulted with the Herzog family before moving forward with the patch tribute.\n\nIt will likely appear on the sleeve opposite the advertisement patch, and the Cardinals will have the Herzog patch eventually on their white home jerseys, the road grays and both the cream-colored Saturday home jerseys and blue Saturday road jerseys.\n\nFermin taking 'professional' at-bats\n\nBack in the majors for the first time since last season, Jose Fermin returns to the Cardinals roster as infield depth and a bench bat option following his strong start to the Class AAA season. In 18 games with Memphis, Fermin posted a .350/.458/.650 slash line. He homered four times and connected on six doubles. At the time of his recall to his recall to the majors, Fermin ranked sixth in average and fourth in OPS (1.108).\n\n\"Just taking a really good at-bat, which we've seen,\" Marmol said. \"I mean, he finds barrel. Like, he just does. Like, he just finds a way to put the barrel on the ball. And he's done a good job with that in Triple-A. He's taken a really professional at-bat.

Also, a happy birthday shoutout to Cedric The Entertainer! And as always, Hochman picks a random St. Louis Car...\n\nWith struggles to find consistent offense persisting 20 games into his second big league season, it became clear to the Cardinals what change was needed for outfielder Jordan Walker.\n\nThrough 58 at-bats, the 21-year-old hit .155 with four doubles and a .498 on-base plus slugging percentage. He struck out 18 times and did not connect on a home run as his ground-ball rate rose and his line-drive production shrunk while he continued to correct mechanical issues.\n\nIn a move described as the \"best\" solution for the young hitter, Walker was optioned to Triple-A Memphis on Wednesday.\n\n\"A lot of discussion around it,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said of Walker's demotion. \"And in thinking what's best for Jordan at the moment for continuing his development, going down into a lower-stakes environment and working on the things that he's been trying to work on over the last several weeks here made the most sense.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He is expected to continue working on mechanical changes for the next two to three days before he makes his way into a minor league game.\n\nSimilar to his April demotion last season after opening the season as St. Louis' starting right fielder, Walker's ground-ball tendency was an issue the Cardinals felt needed to be addressed. Through 20 games this season, Walker produced a 50% ground-ball rate while his 4.8% line-drive rate was more than 10% lower than it was in 2023 and was the second-lowest among players with a minimum of 60 plate appearances entering Wednesday, per FanGraphs.\n\nAgainst breaking pitches, which accounted for 38.2% of the pitches he saw, the second-year slugger had a .150 batting average and a 42.9% swing-and-miss rate, per Statcast. His 37.5% hard-hit rate against breaking pitches was the lowest among pitch groups Walker saw, while the 73.9% chase-miss rate was the highest. Those struggles included making contact on pitches located low and away.\n\n\"I think they go hand in hand,\" Marmol said when asked if the swing issues and pitch selection are connected. \"They don't have to, but I think one amplifies the other. It's hard to stay connected and do what you want to do from a posture standpoint in holding your backside. Some of the things that he's been working on and (keeping) that while swinging at a pitch that is down and away, it's not great. Being able to get the pitch closer to him (and) lay off of that but also even with pitches in the zone, being able to make the move he wants to make with his body.\"\n\nWith Walker in Memphis, utility Gold Glover Brendan Donovan may be used as a regular outfielder for \"the time being,\" Marmol said. There may be more at-bats at the DH spot than previously expected for catchers Willson Contreras and Ivan Herrera as well for outfielder Alec Burleson while Walker looks to swing his way back into the majors.\n\n\"I mean, if he's not going to be in the lineup every day at his age, then the best thing for Jordan Walker is to go down and play every day and get to where he needs to get to,\" Marmol said.\n\nThompson heads to Memphis\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlong with Walker's option to Class AAA, the Cardinals optioned left-hander Zack Thompson to Memphis. Lefty John King and infielder Jose Fermin were recalled in corresponding moves and joined the big league club on Wednesday.\n\nThompson, 26, is expected to join Memphis' rotation to be built up to 85 to 95 pitches in order to be ready for a start in the majors if needed. The consistent role will also allow him to work on issues that have caused his velocity to take dips after he posted a 9.53 ERA in 17 innings to begin the year.\n\n\"Regardless of last night's outing, today would have been the day we made a decision on him either way. ... He needs to get stretched out and get back into throwing 85 (to) 95 pitches per outing and getting enough touches where he's working on the things he needs to work on,\" Marmol said. \"We can't expect him to be sharp out of the 'pen and see a tick up in (velocity) if he's not actually having an opportunity to work on those things.\"\n\nTribute to Whitey\n\nAs a tribute to Hall of Fame manager Whitey Herzog, the Cardinals will soon affix a No. 24 patch to the sleeves of their jerseys for the rest of the 2024 season, an executive with the team confirmed. The circular patch will feature Herzog's name and his retired No. 24, and it will look similar to past memorials the Cardinals have worn.\n\nThe team consulted with the Herzog family before moving forward with the patch tribute.\n\nIt will likely appear on the sleeve opposite the advertisement patch, and the Cardinals will have the Herzog patch eventually on their white home jerseys, the road grays and both the cream-colored Saturday home jerseys and blue Saturday road jerseys.\n\nFermin taking 'professional' at-bats\n\nBack in the majors for the first time since last season, Jose Fermin returns to the Cardinals roster as infield depth and a bench bat option following his strong start to the Class AAA season. In 18 games with Memphis, Fermin posted a .350/.458/.650 slash line. He homered four times and connected on six doubles. At the time of his recall to his recall to the majors, Fermin ranked sixth in average and fourth in OPS (1.108).\n\n\"Just taking a really good at-bat, which we've seen,\" Marmol said. \"I mean, he finds barrel. Like, he just does. Like, he just finds a way to put the barrel on the ball. And he's done a good job with that in Triple-A. He's taken a really professional at-bat. Reports on him have been good.\"\n\nInjury updatesInfielder Matt Carpenter (right oblique strain) will resume his swing progression on Thursday after he received an injection on Monday. Carpenter required a three-day window of no activity before picking up his rehab. He will travel with the Cardinals for their six-game, two-city road trip that begins with a visit to New York to face the Mets.Outfielders Tommy Edman (right wrist) and Dylan Carlson (left shoulder) as well as relievers Keynan Middleton (right forearm strain) and Riley O'Brien (flexor tendon) are expected to remain in St. Louis to continue rehabbing while the Cardinals hit the road.\n\nListen now

He was a consensus top 10 prospects entering the 2023 season after dominating Double-A in 2022. That season he slashed .306/.388/.510 with 19 home runs, 68 RBIs, 31 doubles and 22 stolen bases. He followed that up with a solid showing in the Arizona Fall League where he posted a .925 OPS with five home runs in 21 games.\n\nWalker has had a horrendous start to his 2024 campaign.

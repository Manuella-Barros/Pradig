Despite the recent breakdown of her marriage to Eamonn, Ruth appeared in high spirits in the photos, celebrating with cocktails and posing with her companions.\n\nThe trio spent their evening at Gaia, a Greek Mediterranean restaurant in Mayfair, London, as indicated by Ruth's tagged photos. They seemed to be having a blast, posing for a photo in black sunglasses, with Ruth flashing a peace sign while donning a chic white shirt and black trousers.\n\nAnother snapshot on Ruth's Instagram depicted the three women striking a pose for a full-length mirror selfie. A subsequent image of cocktail glasses hinted at a rather spirited evening, with Ruth confessing in a caption: \"Yes... cocktails were drunk!\"\n\nThis comes as Eamonn's divorcee friend Katie Alexander, 42, was spotted wearing a ring on her engagement finger while out running errands, reports the Express. A source told The Sun: \"Katie looked radiant and like the cat that got the cream.\"\n\nRelationship counsellor Katie has been spotted with the GB News presenter on several occasions over the past year and has been photographed at his home.

She didn't delve into details about her split from Eamonn, but when asked about taking another similar break, she firmly stated that she \"won't do it again.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Eamonn and Ruth released a joint statement confirming their divorce: \"Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.\" Eamonn has been battling health issues for a while now, which has been tough on both of them.\n\nPrior to their separation announcement, Ruth spoke candidly about the situation to Woman's Weekly. She expressed: \"I don't know how much Eamonn's mobility will improve. We live in hope. He does the physio, but there might have to be some acceptance that this might never be 100% right. With any care situation - and there are millions of carers in this country - it isn't always easy. It's testing but we manage as a family.\"\n\nShe further added: \"I look at Eamonn, who's had his health and back problems, and it makes you realise how important your health is.\" Ruth and Eamonn are parents to a 22 year old son, Jack, Eamonn also has three other children, Declan, 35, Rebecca, 32, and Niall, 30, from a previous relationship.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_jones@ok.co.uk", "name": "Amy Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alexandra_bullard@ok.co.uk", "name": "Alexandra Bullard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eamonn Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Langsford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Langsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Loose Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greek cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greek language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayfair"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mayfair"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32968946.ece/alternates/s1200/0_ruth-langsford.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790376", "eventUri": "eng-9790376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

The friendship has grown in recent months but Eamonn's marriage has been over for some time.\n\n\"She wants to help Eamonn with his situation and their friendship has grown over a period of time.\n\n\"She feels she will be close to him for a long period and is in this for the long haul.\" While Eamonn has thanked fans for their support, Ruth has stayed quiet on the split and took some time away from Loose Women.\n\nAs well as his marriage breakdown, Eamonn has problems walking - and has been suffering chronic back pain for almost two years. Speaking in January the presenter said the \"harsh reality\" could be that he may never be able to walk alone again unaided.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zara_woodcock@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zara Woodcock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eamonn Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Langsford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Langsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loose Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33393592.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_ehka_main.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790376", "eventUri": "eng-9790376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

It was just minutes from Katie's home.\n\nThe charity - a nine-hour round trip from Eamonn's home - is where his new therapist confidant worked for up to two years.\n\nEamonn beamed in a snap with staff afterwards at her local restaurant, Arthur's.\n\nHe happily posted the picture online, but again fans had no idea of the poignancy behind the image.\n\nDivorcee mother of three Katie met Eamonn via Twitter after she commented on a post and it sparked a conversation in 2015.\n\nPals say that Katie's counselling specialities - including 'affairs and betrayals', 'feeling sad', and 'separation and divorce' - are a \"bitter irony and a kick in the teeth for Ruth\".\n\nWe exclusively told how Eamonn and Ruth split and are to divorce, with the couple sharing a statement with us which shocked the showbiz world.\n\nAnd we revealed Eamonn had already moved out of the couple's home - after Ruth discovered messages on a laptop.\n\nCracks had started to appear in the popular duo's relationship and they had not been photographed out together for two years.\n\nBut Ruth had stuck around to help Eamonn during his medical crisis.\n\nThe anchor has had a double hip replacement in 2016.\n\nHe had back surgery last year but it left him using a wheelchair.\n\nAnd in January he broke his shoulder in a fall.\n\nRuth, 64, confided to her closest friends that there was \"no way back\" for the marriage.\n\nShe and twice married Eamonn first met in 1997 and in 2002 she gave birth to their son, Jack.\n\nThey won millions of fans presenting ITV's This Morning together between 2006 and

Ruth has been providing updates on their pooch's health, while fans have noticed an absence of Maggie on Eamonn's account.\n\nMaggie, who is 14 years old, recently had a procedure at the vet to remove a growth. Ruth posted updates on Maggie alongside adorable photos of the dog lounging at home. It came just two days after Eamonn shared a photo cuddling Maggie and said: \"A lot of you wondering about Maggie. She's had an op to remove a growth. All well . Not bad for a 14 year old ! In fact she's in better shape than me.\"\n\nREAD MORE - Ruth Langsford returns to Loose Women with a bang as stance on Eamonn Holmes split revealed\n\nREAD MORE - Ruth Langsford's Loose Women co-star breaks silence on her split from Eamonn Holmes\n\nThis weekend, Maggie spent time with Ruth and her mum as they enjoyed cuddles together. Maggie hopped into bed with Ruth's mum as the presenter said: \"Another afternoon nap for Grandma disturbed!!\" She then appeared to send a defiant message as Maggie gazed lovingly at her. Ruth wrote: \"Not a bit sorry!!\"\n\nMaggie made an appearance on This Morning when Ruth and Eamonn were still hosts of the ITV daytime show. Back in 2016, Maggie joined the former couple live on TV and ahead of her being brought into the studio, Ruth told viewers: \"If we were to split, Eamonn and I, who would Maggie choose?\" She ended up declaring that it was \"equal,\" though Eamonn noted he was approached first.\n\nRecently, Ruth issued a health update on the pup as she shared: \"Maggie had a little wart removed this morning under sedation so she's feeling a bit sorry for herself this afternoon! Lots of TLC from Mummy required.\" She added: \"Thank you [St George's Veterinary Centre] for looking after our precious girl.\"\n\nThe former couple, who tied the knot in 2010, share a 22-year-old son together named Jack, as well as their dog Maggie. They are yet to discuss the reason behind their split in their own words yet friends close to the Loose Women presenter revealed that there is no going back for the couple. Ruth has been left \"hurt\" after finding out her husband is being consoled by another woman with whom he's been on a string of outings.\n\nWhile at the TRIC awards in June, a candid Eamonn shared with The Mirror: \"I'm not OK. This is not a good time at all.\" When quizzed about the future of his relationship with Ruth, Eamonn said: \"It's too early to say but I hope we can still be friends.\" Eamonn and Ruth's romance began in 1997 and they were married for 14 years until their split in May.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The young counsellor routinely makes the long drive from Huddersfield to Eamonn's luxurious South West London home every weekend, it's claimed.\n\nHowever, those hoping for another glamorous showbiz wedding might be disappointed. Insiders close to Katie have confirmed that the ring is merely a piece of costume jewelry.\n\nIn an interview with MailOnline, a source close to Eamonn confirmed: \"That is not an engagement ring.\"\n\nThe 64-year-old TV star moved out of the house he shared with his wife, Ruth Langsford earlier this year, after she reportedly discovered compromising messages between him and another woman.\n\nThis upheaval coincided with 42-year-old Katie becoming more involved in Eamonn's life.\n\nKatie reportedly told friends she and Eamonn are \"planning a future together\".\n\nThis came as a shock to many, as their relationship had previously been described as merely a \"close friendship.\"\n\nThe relationship - ongoing for months before Eamonn's public split from Ruth - has seen him showering Katie with gifts, trips, and outings like a trip to the Woburn Safari Park and tickets to a Beyonce concert.\n\nRuth Langsford, Eamonn's now-estranged wife and former co-host on ITV's This Morning, has reportedly confided in close friends that their marriage is irreparably broken.\n\nThe couple first met in 1997, and quickly became one of Britain's most beloved and popular TV couples.\n\nThey hosted ITV's This Morning together for 15 years, until 2021. Since then, Eamonn has moved over to GB News, whilst Ruth has been a mainstay on the Loose Women panel. The couple also have one son together.\n\nBut with this new chapter in Eamonn's life unfolding, it appears both are set to go their separate ways professionally and personally.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruth herself has been spending time with close friends.\n\nRecently back on ITV's Loose Women after a brea, Ruth seems to be embracing the single life with open arms.\n\nShe was recently spotted enjoying a night out with friends. The trio shared snaps of them enjoying cocktails and Greek cuisine at a chic Mediterranean restaurant in Mayfair, London.\n\nIn a snap posted on Instagram, Ruth was all smiles as she cosied up to friends Rachael Eleri and Liv Davey.\n\nThe 64-year-old presenter donned a white shirt, black jeans and sunglasses as she flashed a peace sign.\n\nA later post showed the three of them holding cocktails. Ruth wrote on the post: \"Yes... cocktails were drunk!\"", "source": {"uri": "entertainmentdailyuk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ella_clarke@entertainmentdailyuk.com", "name": "Ella Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eamonn Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Langsford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Langsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huddersfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huddersfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woburn_Safari_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woburn Safari Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Morning_(TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "This Morning (TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greek cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loose Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayfair"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mayfair"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2024/08/05110905/Untitled-76.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790376", "eventUri": "eng-9790376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Looking very glamorous, sporting a natty white blazer, Breton striped top and black designer sunglasses, she captioned the selfie, which she took in a lift: \"Design meetings all afternoon @QVCUK.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Ticketmaster release more Taylor Swift tickets for London Eras Tour - but you'll need to be quick\n\nREAD MORE: This Morning star with baby joy as she shares exciting news with Lorraine Kelly\n\nIt comes after Ruth returned to Loose Women last month after a three-month hiatus, telling the audience: \"Welcome to your first Loose Women of the week, it's great to have your company!\" Her co-star Coleen Nolan added: \"Can I just say, I am so so happy you are back.\" As the crowd cheered for her return, panellist Janet Street-Porter shouted: \"Thank God! Thank God. I was left with her and her,\" she joked gesturing to Coleen and Brenda Edwards. \"I know, I won't do it again Janet.

However, there were multiple reports about why she split with the seasoned journalist, with some claiming the mum-of-one was tired of looking after the dad-of-four, who has had a double hip operation and struggles to walk.\n\nEamonn spoke about his ill health at the recent TRIC Awards when he told the Mirror he felt like he was living on \"borrowed time\". Struggling with chronic back pain, which saw him require a high-tech wheelchair at the ceremony, the star spoke candidly about his health after his father died aged 65 from a fatal heart attack in 1991.\n\nThe presenter has battled multiple heath issues over the past few years, before his split with Ruth was announced. Speaking to us, he admitted he had considered pulling out of attending the star-studded bash in London, which he usually goes to with his estranged wife, as he had been in so much pain.\n\nEamonn is reportedly leaning on several female friends in the wake of his split from Ruth. The Belfast man said he hoped to remain on good terms with his soon-to-be ex-spouse, despite the Loose Women star staying silent about their relationship.\n\nAccording to Best magazine, when asked about the mother of his youngest son, Jack, he responded, \"It's too early to say, but I hope we can still be friends.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The veteran broadcaster, who parted ways with his wife Ruth Langsford earlier this year, engaged in a heartfelt discussion about how animals can sense distress and exhibit profound affection.\n\nDuring the conversation with co-host Isabel Webster, they touched upon research indicating that cats can mourn the loss of their animal companions. Eamonn, seemingly lost in contemplation, glanced down at his hands, his expression tinged with melancholy.\n\nHe remarked: \"I think it's fascinating how we are being shown and educated the feelings of animals and that they know and can sense when things are wrong and they show and can demonstrate lots and lots of love as well.\"\n\nIsabel chimed in with a personal story about her own cat giving her the cold shoulder\" after she returns from a trip. Eamonn, clasping his hands and inadvertently concealing the wedding band he still wore, queried humorously: \"In a huff?\"\n\nBoth Eamonn and Ruth frequently post about their beloved dog, Maggie, on their respective social media platforms. Reports have surfaced suggesting that the ex-couple is facing \"difficult conversations\" over the custody of their cherished canine as they approach the final stages of their separation, reports the Express.\n\nAn insider previously revealed to the media: \"Maggie is like a daughter to them. They dote on her. But she's getting on and they know she needs stability.\n\n\"It's a case of who can give her that. Eamonn adores her and Maggie's been such a support during his health woes.\"\n\nThey continued: \"The thought of giving her up is heartbreaking to him. But if Ruth is able to get out and about and walk her more, then it may well be that she gets Maggie in the split.\"\n\nThe beloved 14-year-old canine has recently had a vet operation to remove a lump, with Ruth taking to social media to post updates and charming photos of Maggie recuperating at home.\n\nThis followed Eamonn sharing a tender photo with Maggie, with the caption: \"A lot of you wondering about Maggie. She's had an op to remove a growth. All well. Not bad for a 14-year-old!

The statement read: \"Ruth and Eamonn have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.\"\n\nDuring a chat on Loose Women today, the panel - which also included Myleene Klass, Gloria Hunniford and Linda Robson - chatted about embarrassing their children. Ruth recalled a story of how she left Jack embarrassed when she used to deliberately get the names of his favourite singers wrong and whilst he initially found it funny, she soon left him feeling embarrassed.\n\nRecalling a particular memory, she said: \"When Jack was young, we used to like - I always had music on and if I was in a supermarket and a song would come on, I'd always pretend to get the band's name wrong. I'd go, 'oh it's Trizzle Sticks (Rizzle Kicks) I love them' and he used to think I was really funny and he'd always laugh about it.\n\n\"I remember one day saying exactly that, like I'd always done, and I was like 'Oh Jack Trizzle Sticks my favourite!' and he was like 'oh mum you're so embarrassing' and you know at that moment, you've lost them. He went through a phase of - I would come in and go 'morning' and he'd go 'what?' and I'd be like 'morning, do you want some breakfast?' and he'd be like 'no.'\"\n\nRuth made her return to Loose Women last week, before taking a brief break. A source said: \"It will no doubt be emotional for her to return but she just wants to get on with things now. The time feels right for her to get back to Loose Women. It is a job she loves doing and even though the split has been very tough, life must go on and Ruth is determined to get back to her day job ... Just don't expect any big news or revelations about the divorce, she wants to keep that private.\"\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasmine_allday@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jasmine Allday", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eamonn Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Langsford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Langsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myleene_Klass", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myleene Klass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Hunniford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gloria Hunniford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Robson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Robson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loose Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizzle_Kicks", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rizzle Kicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33397736.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_1308-Ruth-Langsford-makes-confession-about-son-Jack-in-rare-insight-into-family-life-after-bitter-E.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790376", "eventUri": "eng-9790376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Ruth has been providing updates on their pooch's health, while fans have noticed an absence of Maggin on Eamonn's account.\n\nMaggie, who is 14-years-old, recently had a procedure at the vet to remove a growth. Ruth posted updates on Maggie alongside adorable photos of the dog lounging at home. It came just two days after Eamonn shared a photo cuddling Maggie and said: \"A lot of you wondering about Maggie. She's had an op to remove a growth. All well . Not bad for a 14 year old ! In fact she's in better shape than me.\"\n\nThis weekend, Maggie spent time with Ruth and her mum as they enjoyed cuddles together. Maggie hopped into bed with Ruth's mum as the presenter said: \"Another afternoon nap for Grandma disturbed!!\" She then appeared to send a defiant message as Maggie gazed lovingly at her. Ruth wrote: \"Not a bit sorry!!\"\n\nMaggie made an appearance on This Morning when Ruth and Eamonn were still hosts of the ITV daytime show. Back in 2016, Maggie joined the former couple live on TV and ahead of her being brought into the studio, Ruth told viewers: \"If we were to split, Eamonn and I, who would Maggie choose?\" She ended up declaring that it was \"equal,\" though Eamonn noted he was approached first.\n\nRecently, Ruth issued a health update on the pup as she shared: \"Maggie had a little wart removed this morning under sedation so she's feeling a bit sorry for herself this afternoon! Lots of TLC from Mummy required.\" She added: \"Thank you [St George's Veterinary Centre] for looking after our precious girl.\"\n\nThe former couple, who tied the knot in 2010, share a 22-year-old son together named Jack, as well as their dog Maggie.

Not bad for a 14-year-old! In fact she's in better shape than me.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Maggie enjoyed some quality time with Ruth and her mother, snuggling up for cuddles.

And if I was in a supermarket and a song would come on, I'd always pretend to get the band's name wrong. I'd go, 'oh it's Trizzle Sticks (Rizzle Kicks) I love them' and he used to think I was really funny. He'd always laugh about it.\n\n\"I remember one day saying exactly that, like I'd always done, and I was like 'Oh Jack Trizzle Sticks my favourite!' and he was like 'oh mum you're so embarrassing' and you know at that moment, you've lost them. He went through a phase of - I would come in and go 'morning' and he'd go 'what?' and I'd be like 'morning, do you want some breakfast?' and he'd be like 'no.'\"\n\nRuth's memory comes after speculation over how Jack would cope amid the high profile split of his parents.\n\nED! previously spoke to relationship expert and founder of Chapter2, Nicky Wake, about the former This Morning stars' split.\n\nDiscussing Ruth and Eamonn's son, Jack, Nicky said: \"No matter your age, seeing your parents split up is hard. Jack is 22, and whilst he has famous parents, he's chosen to have a private life away from the showbiz industry.\n\n\"He might be reliant more on friends, extended family members, or mentors for emotional support during the divorce process.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nLoose Women's Ruth Langsford has opened up about distancing herself from friends when she felt the relationships turned \"toxic\".\n\nThe 64-year-old presenter recently returned to the ITV daytime show following her split from husband Eamonn Holmes after 15 years of marriage.\n\nOn Monday's show, Ruth was joined by Gloria Hunniford, Linda Robson, and Myleene Klass as they delved into a discussion sparked by a journalist's claim that female friendships are too toxic to maintain.\n\nKicking off the conversation, Ruth said: \"A journalist said today that female friends are too toxic to bother with and she says that women can be too catty, overly sensitive and competitive over everything from marriage to body shape. Is she right?\"\n\nMyleene strongly disagreed with the statement, arguing: \"I think it's so lazy to make that kind of comment. It's just women being put against women and it's never done to men. I couldn't disagree more because my girlfriends are my absolute rock through divorce, miscarriage and everything.\"\n\nShe continued, highlighting the strength of her friendships: \"I call them my 4am because there are some girlfriends I know I can rely on to ring at 4am. I had one girlfriend who knocked on my door at 2am because she didn't hear from me,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nAddressing the misconception about the Loose Women panel, Ruth added: \"We suffer it on Loose Women where people always try to say 'Aw the Loose Women are always falling out' or 'you can' all get on'.\n\n\"It's almost as if people can't accept that a woman can get along with a woman. I'm not saying there can't be catty women, but there are also catty men and b****y men too.\"\n\nSpeaking about her own circle of friends, Ruth shared: \"I've got girlfriends from school. Julie, Helen and Jenny, they were with me recently and they are my 4am friends.\n\n\"I wouldn't have toxic friends and over the years I haven't had a full blown fall out but I just distance myself from people when I start to feel that it's becoming toxic or jealousy or catty. I just think you're not my friend if you are behaving like that. So I just remove myself.\"\n\nLoose Women is on ITV on weekdays at 12.30pm", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monde_mwitumwa@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Monde Mwitumwa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Langsford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Langsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myleene_Klass", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Myleene Klass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Loose Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Hunniford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gloria Hunniford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Robson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Robson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eamonn Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/article29680912.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ruth-langsford-body-language-on-loose-women-judi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790376", "eventUri": "eng-9790376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

the bolthole on a luxury private estate near leafy Richmond Park.\n\nThe Sun has told how Katie has lifted the ailing 64-year-old TV star's spirits at his \u00a32m bachelor pad.\n\nAnd the 42-year-old has excitedly shared with friends that she and Eamonn are \"planning a future together\".\n\nHowever, fans hoping for a showbiz wedding look set to be disappointed as a source close to Katie admitted the ring was a piece of costume jewellery.\n\nWe previously revealed how Eamonn had become intimate with the counsellor specialising in 'affairs and betrayals' months before his marriage split.\n\nIn the last year, he grew close with Katie behind the back of his devastated wife and co-presenter Ruth.\n\nEamonn, beset by mobility issues, has showered Katie with gifts and trips and befriended her kids as their close relationship developed further.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_wells@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Callum

Is she right?\"\n\nMyleene robustly dismissed the statement, countering: \"I think it's so lazy to make that kind of comment. It's just women being put against women and it's never done to men. I couldn't disagree more because my girlfriends are my absolute rock through divorce, miscarriage and everything.\"\n\nContinuing her praise for close friendships, she remarked: \"I call them my 4am because there are some girlfriends I know I can rely on to ring at 4am.

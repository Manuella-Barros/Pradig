Page had to withstand boos and calls for him to quit from some Wales fans after Gibraltar \u2013 ranked 203 out of the 210 teams in world football \u2013 held the Dragons 0-0 in a friendly at the Estadio Algarve on Thursday. The Wales manager fielded an inexperienced side in Portugal with a threadbare squad hit by a host of withdrawals and the sterner test against Slovakia to come. Ethan Ampadu will return to captain Wales for the first time, while Danny Ward, Chris Mepham and Jordan James will also play after sitting out the Gibraltar game. There should also be starts for Brennan Johnson, Daniel James and Kieffer Moore, who were introduced into the attack during the second half on Thursday. Page said: \u201cWe were disappointed with the Gibraltar game but we must move forward. \u201cWe\u2019ll put it right and go again on Sunday. It\u2019s another friendly and it is what it is from a selection point of view. \u201cThe lads are on the back of three weeks off, so it was unrealistic to start with our strongest team for the two games. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we picked that team to play Gibraltar because we want to expose some of the younger players to international football.\u201d Page gave five players \u2013 Charlie Crew, Fin Stevens, Jay Dasilva, Lewis Koumas and Tom King \u2013 their debuts against Gibraltar. Liverpool teenager Koumas, who met the club\u2019s record goalscorer and former Wales striker Ian Rush at their Portuguese training camp this week, came close to scoring after being sent on as a 73rd-minute substitute. \u201cThe keeper\u2019s made a great save from his left-footed shot and his work-rate off the ball was phenomenal,\u201d said Page. \u201cSo he\u2019s done his chances no harm whatsoever. \u201cBoth Lewis and Charlie have really impressed and I can see why they\u2019re being spoken about in such a high manner at club level. \u201cFin Stevens and Matty Baker have also stepped up. The new lads that we\u2019ve brought in have adapted really easily.\u201d Having missed out on qualification for Euro 2024, the Slovakia friendly is Wales\u2019 final outing before the Nations League campaign gets under way in September. Wales are in the same League B group as Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey, with the competition having a partial bearing on qualification for the 2026 World Cup. Page said: \u201cThe performances in the play-offs against Finland and Poland were exceptional, so I\u2019m not going to get too carried away (with the Gibraltar result). \u201cWe\u2019re unbeaten since September. The form at the minute has been OK with regards to results.\u201d", "summary": "Several senior players will feature after missing Thursday\u2019s stalemate.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/rob-page-slovakia-gibraltar-ethan-ampadu-brennan-johnson-b2559143.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/13/7033045622c6b00568351baa0e451ee0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTMzNDE1-2.75683359.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:37:07", "author": "Phil Blanche", "authors": ["Phil Blanche"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.105}

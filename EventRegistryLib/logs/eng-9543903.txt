Your actions bring the city of Akron into disrepute or ridicule and demonstrate that you are unable to safely and effectively serve as a police officer.\"\n\nWestlake, who has been has been disciplined five times and was fired then reinstated in 2021, will have 10 days to request a hearing before Mayor Shammas Malik. The matter could also then go before an arbitrator.\n\nCity leaders said the recommendation to fire Westlake is unrelated to the April 1 shooting that has prompted many community leaders to call for his termination. Community leaders also have questioned why Westlake, who has been an officer for nine years, has been allowed to remain a police officer, given his troubled past.\n\nThe two incidents that city leaders say are the basis for their termination recommendation involve:\n\nPolice supervisors deemed Westlake's use of force in the December incident to be unreasonable and disagreed on whether his actions in the March incident were justified. The first supervisor who evaluated the March incident found it to be reasonable, but higher-up supervisors found it was not.\n\nWestlake has already been involved in five use-of-force incidents in the first four months of this year. The department has an early warning system that kicks in when an officer has six use-of-force incidents in a year in which police supervisors are notified. The most use-of force Westlake had in prior years was seven in 2021 and eight in 2023, according to his personnel records.\n\nWestlake has been involved in more than 30 use-of-force incidents, with most of them deemed to be reasonable by his supervisors.\n\nMayor Dan Horrigan fired Westlake on July 20, 2021, saying he wasn't \"fit\" to be an Akron officer. He pointed to two drunken and violent off-duty incidents between Westlake and his girlfriend, including one in which she accused him of punching her, holding a gun to her head and threatening to kill her and her father.\n\nWestlake was charged with domestic violence and aggravated menacing, but these charges were dropped and the case expunged after his girlfriend refused to cooperate.\n\nWestlake was reinstated the day after he was fired and instead suspended for 71 days after a deal was struck between the police union and city leaders.\n\nWestlake has also been disciplined for ramming a truck during a chase, operating a patrol wagon unsafely, refusing to give his name or identification number to a citizen during a call, and improperly handling drug evidence.\n\nWestlake had never been involved in a shooting before April 1, when he responded to a call about a male pointing a gun at houses, his personnel file shows.\n\nWestlake drove up near a teen holding a gun, told him to show him his hands, then, seconds later, shot him in the hand.\n\nThe gun that Tavion Koonce-Williams, 15, was holding was fake. He was facing a misdemeanor facsimile firearms charge, but this charge was dismissed Monday in Summit County Juvenile Court, pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting.\n\nMore: Can de-escalation training help prevent police shootings? Here's what the experts say\n\nThe shooting is being investigated by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The BCI findings then will be presented to a grand jury. The police department and the Citizen's Police Oversight Board will then also investigate.\n\nImokhai Okolo, the attorney for Tavion's family, has made several demands, including that Westlake be immediately fired.\n\nThe shooting resulted in a protest in front of City Hall and questions being raised during recent meetings, including Akron City Council and the Akron school board.\n\nWestlake had a pre-disciplinary hearing last week before city and police leaders about the use-of-force incidents in December and March.\n\nThey allowed Westlake time to respond, then met with him again Monday and told him they were terminating him.\n\nThe city provided the Beacon Journal videos and documents pertaining to these incidents Monday.\n\nIn the Dec. 31 incident, Westlake and other officers surrounded a house to arrest a 23-year-old Akron man who was wanted on several felony warrant and had been involved in a vehicle chase with Westlake the day before. The man ran out of the front door of the house, and Westlake and other officers chased him.\n\nWestlake, who was carrying an assault rifle as he ran, deployed his Taser at the man, as did another officer. The man kept running.\n\nWestlake saw the man hiding in bushes and alerted other officers. Another officer shot the man with his Taser and the man dropped to the ground.\n\n\"Hands behind your back!\" Westlake yelled at the man who was laying on his stomach. \"Hands behind your [expletive] back now!\"\n\nWestlake pressed the barrel of his assault rifle to the back of the man's head while other officers placed handcuffs on his wrists. He then moved the rifle away. Westlake grabbed the man's hair to move his head.\n\nA police supervisor said he contacted the training bureau and asked if the use of a rifle in this was taught in rifle training. The supervisor was told officers \"have never been taught to use a rifle in this manner,\" according to a supervisor's report.\n\nWestlake said in his use-of-force report that he touched the man's hair to evaluate getting a Taser wire untangled. He also said he was tired from his foot pursuit and \"was in an adrenalized state.\"\n\nPolice supervisors found the actions of all the officers except for Westlake to be reasonable. A supervisor said Westlake's use of his rifle and grabbing the man's hair to be a violation of the department's rule that says force can only be used in \"circumstances specified by law, and then only when necessary to accomplish a police task successfully.\"\n\nIn the March 1 incident, Westlake responded to a complaint by a convenience store owner that a customer and her friends were stealing from him.\n\nThe teen-age customer denied that anything had been stolen.\n\nWhile other officers searched for the teen's friends outside the store, Westlake told the teen to turn around so he could handcuff her. She refused and told him not to touch her.\n\n\"Don't fight be because it's not going to go well for you,\" he told the teen as he handcuffed her, then led her from the store.\n\nWestlake told the teen to get into his cruiser. He then swung her around and she fell, landing on the ground beside the cruiser, a surveillance video showed.\n\nThe first supervisor who reviewed this incident found the use of force to be reasonable. When the video is watched at full speed, the supervisor said, it looked like Westlake threw the teen to the ground. But the supervisor said that doesn't appear to be the case when the video is viewed frame-by-frame.\n\n\"I find it reasonable to believe he lost control of the suspect after she lost her balance while he was trying to get her in his cruiser,\" the supervisor said.\n\nTwo other police sergeants and a lieutenant, though, found that Westlake's use of force wasn't reasonable and violated the department's use-of-force procedure and the rule that requires an officer to be responsible for the safety and protection of a person in his or her custody.\n\nWestlake said in his use-of-force report that the teen pulled away from him and he pulled her toward the cruiser. He said her back struck the door and she fell to the pavement, landing on her backside.\n\n\"I felt it was imperative to get her in the cruiser reasonably quickly,\" Westlake said.\n\nThe Beacon Journal recently talked to police and union leaders about how the department handles use-of-force incidents.\n\nCapt. Michael Miller, a spokesman for the police department, said all use-of force incidents are investigated by a police supervisor.\n\nThe investigations are then forwarded to Internal Affairs, which does its own review.\n\nThe investigations normally take between 30 and 60 days, Miller said.\n\nIf a use-of force incident is deemed to not be reasonable, Miller said Internal Affairs determines what rule or rules were violated and then submits this to the chief, who decides what punishment is appropriate. Miller said the chief looks at factors like whether this was the first time the officer was found to have violated this rule or rules.\n\nMiller said it's not uncommon for patrol officers, who are the ones responding to citizen's calls, to have several use-of-force incidents in a year. He said the number could depend on how busy of an area the officer is assigned to patrol.\n\n\"More calls/more arrests could make a difference,\" he said.\n\nMiller said the police union is involved in the discipline process, as required by the contract.\n\nAkron FOP Lodge 7 President Brian Lucey said officers may need to resort to force when someone isn't cooperating or is having a mental health crisis.\n\n\"That's part of our job,\" he said.\n\nLucey said use-of-force incidents represent less than 1% of the calls that officers handle.\n\nMiller said in a press release Monday about Westlake's firing that the department and city administration won't provide further comment but will provide \"future updates to the community as appropriate.\"\n\nStephanie Warsmith can be reached at

He has faced four other disciplinary actions and has had more than 30 use-of-force incidents, most of which were deemed reasonable by supervisors. He has recently come under scrutiny for shooting a teen in the hand who had a fake gun on April 1.\n\nCity and police leaders terminated Westlake Monday after use-of force incidents on Dec. 31 and March 1 that police supervisors found to be in violation of the department's rules and regulations.\n\nWestlake will have the opportunity to request a hearing before the Akron mayor and for this matter to be taken to arbitration.\n\nHere's a look at Westlake's troubled history with the Akron Police Department, based on records and videos provided by the city and police department. All use-of-force incidents were deemed reasonable by the Akron Police Department and didn't lead to discipline unless otherwise noted:\n\nAug. 29, 2014: Ryan Westlake is hired as an Akron police officer.\n\nFeb. 17, 2017: Westlake and other officers responded to a call about a man passed out in a car. After being woken up and assessed by paramedics, the man charged toward officers, then tried to run.

Westlake used his Taser to stun the man in the back and the officers then handcuffed him.\n\nMarch 4, 2018: Westlake was on his way to work when he saw a man running in and out of traffic on state Route 8. Westlake ran after the man and ordered him to the side of the road. He placed a handcuff on one of his wrists, but the man wouldn't let him handcuff on the other wrist. Westlake wrapped his arms around the man and pulled him to the ground. With the man flailing his arms, Westlake put his knees on his back until another officer arrived and helped handcuff the man.\n\nAug. 11, 2018: Westlake and another officer pulled over a man whom they knew had a suspended driver's license. The man knocked down the other officer and tried to run past him, but the officer stopped him. Westlake deployed his Taser but missed. Westlake punched the man in the abdomen several times and then in the face, and he and the other officer handcuffed the man.\n\nSept. 27, 2018: Westlake and another officer saw a motorcycle rider being pursued by an unmarked car driven by a Summit County sheriff's deputy. Westlake tried to help the deputy handcuff the driver, who dragged the two of them down a driveway and onto the ground. The officers handcuffed him.\n\nJan. 2, 2020: Westlake and other officers responded to a domestic dispute involving a mother and her son who has mental issues. The man threw punches at two officers and they both deployed their Tasers, which weren't effective. Westlake punched the man in his mid-section twice. Two officers punched the man, who was refusing to be handcuffed, in the face. Officers then handcuffed him.\n\nSept. 8, 2020: Westlake and another officer attempted to pull over a vehicle with a driver whose license was suspended. The driver fled and officers pursued him for two blocks before the driver stopped. Westlake pulled the driver from his vehicle, placed him on his stomach and handcuffed him.\n\nDec. 4, 2020: Westlake is involved in a dispute with his girlfriend at a hotel in Fort Lauderdale. She told police he threw her into a coffee table, pinned her arms to the ground and struck her. She declined to press charges.\n\nJan. 7, 2021: Westlake and another officer pulled over a vehicle, with the driver fleeing on foot while holding a gun. An officer caught up to the man, who threw his gun, and wrestled with him. Another officer deployed his Taser, and Westlake handcuffed the man.\n\nJan. 9, 2021: Westlake is involved in another dispute with his girlfriend at his Cuyahoga Falls apartment in which she told police he pushed her to the ground, hit her in the eye, and held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her and her father. He is charged with domestic violence and aggravated menacing. These charges were later dismissed and the case expunged after his girlfriend refused to cooperate.\n\nMarch 13, 2021: Westlake and another officer are involved in a car chase, followed by a foot chase. An officer deployed his Taser, striking the driver. Westlake tried to handcuff the man, who refused to give up one of his hands, and Westlake punched the man in the back. Officers handcuffed the man.\n\nMarch 14, 2021: Westlake and another officer followed a car that pulled into a driveway. The driver became argumentative and gestured with his arms. Westlake and other officers forced the man to the ground and handcuffed him.\n\nJuly 20, 2021: Mayor Dan Horrigan terminates Westlake, pointing to the two off-duty incidents involving his girlfriend and to a call in which he used foul language.\n\nJuly 21, 2021: Westlake is reinstated and instead suspended for 71 days without pay.\n\nNov. 23, 2021: Westlake and another officer chased the driver of a truck who drove onto a closed entrance to Interstate 77 and, after officers surrounded him, struck two cruisers. Westlake rammed into the truck with his cruiser in an attempt to disable it. The truck fled and officers pursued it, with the driver slamming on its brakes twice and Westlake rear-ended it. The chase was called off after the driver went on Route 8 and into Cuyahoga Falls, reaching up to 86 mph. Westlake is eventually suspended for two days for ramming the truck and not immediately reporting it.\n\nDec. 8, 2021: Westlake and another officer saw a car with an expired registration that pulled into a driveway. The driver refused to give officers his keys so they could search his vehicle prior to having it towed. He also refused to put his hands behind his back. Westlake struck him in the lower back several times. Westlake, with the help of other officers, handcuffed him.\n\nDec. 11, 2021: Westlake and another officer attempted to stop a vehicle for having illegally tinted windows. The vehicle didn't stop but then pulled over. A passenger fled and Westlake chased him and deployed his taser, with the man falling to the ground. The man tried to flee again but fell. Westlake stunned the man with his taser in the lower back and rear of his head. Westlake punched the man several times, then handcuffed him.\n\nDec. 18, 2021: Westlake and other officers attempted to stop a vehicle that was suspected of having been in an earlier chase. Westlake, who was on the driver's side, deployed his Taser, striking the passenger in the back who was being taken out of the vehicle by other officers. The passenger and the officers who were handcuffing him were shocked by the Taser. A supervisor found Westlake's use of a Taser wasn't reasonable. The police union says the incident later was deemed reasonable and Westlake wasn't disciplined.\n\nJan. 15, 2022: Westlake and another officer responded to a call about a burglary, with two suspects having fled. Westlake chased a man matching a suspect's description.

This was his third violation of this rule.\n\nApril 14, 2023: Westlake and another officer responded to a call about a domestic dispute involving a man threatening a woman with a bat. The man struggled with Westlake and another officer as they handcuffed him and then refused to walk. Westlake applied a pressure point behind his left ear. Westlake and the other officer pulled the man along to get him to a cruiser.\n\nMay 7, 2023: Westlake chased a motorcycle that had been reported stolen during a breaking and entering by Norton police. When the motorcycle stalled, Westlake grabbed the rider, who attempted to flee again. Westlake pulled the rider off the motorcycle and sat on him. He handcuffed him with the help of another officer.\n\nJune 8, 2023: Westlake saw a vehicle parked in a driveway that was suspected of being used in a music video at a drive-thru in which males displayed guns and threatened to shoot and rob an employee.

He then grabbed the man's hair and twisted, to turn his head.\n\nThe captain who wrote the report noted Westlake's use of the rifle was \"in a manner not taught to him\" by the Akron police training bureau, and that grabbing the man's hair served \"no law enforcement purpose.\"\n\nThen on March 1, while arresting a suspect in a reported theft at a convenience store, Westlake \"used his handcuffs as a pressure point\" to force the resisting arrestee to walk. He then \"pulled her towards his car. She fell, and later claimed injury.\n\nThough an Akron sergeant and platoon members agreed Westlake's use of force in the March 1 arrest was reasonable and within department policy, the Office of Professional Standards and Accountability disagreed, finding violations of the department's policies for use of force and for the safety and protection of those in police custody.\n\nIn Westlake's most recent incident, he responded on April 1 to a report of a man pointing a gun at houses near the intersection of Brittain Road and Ottawa Avenue.\n\nThere, he found 15-year-old Tavion Koonce-Williams carrying what appeared to be a firearm, and opened fire, striking him in the hand. Police later determined the gun was a fake.\n\nWestlake was placed on paid administrative leave following the April 1 shooting.\n\nHe served on the Akron police force for nine years. He was previously fired from the department but reinstated.\n\nUnder Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 7 collective bargaining rules, Westlake is able to appeal his May 6 termination, according to the release. If Mayor Shammas Malik upholds Westlake's firing, the union may choose to seek arbitration.\n\nSummit County Prosecutor Elliott Kolkovich on Monday announced his office asked the county juvenile court to dismiss a complaint against Koonce-Williams in relation to carrying the fake gun, while an independent state investigation continues.", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Akron police say Westlake's termination was based on two recent use-of-force incidents, both occurring before he shot Tavion Koonce-Williams in the wrist on Apr. 1.\n\nWestlake had been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. But the department said his firing was for separate incidents on Dec. 31 and March 1.\n\nKoonce-Williams was charged with carrying the fake gun on Apr. 19 after a woman called police and reported that a Black man, later identified at Koonce-Williams, pointed a firearm at residences in Akron's Goodyear neighborhood. Westlake responded to the shooting and shot Koonce-Williams, despite the teen alerting the officer that the gun was fake.\n\nAt a preliminary trial hearing on Monday, Summit County Prosecutor Elliot Kolvovich asked for the case against Koonce-Williams to be dismissed. Juvenile Court Judge Linda Teodosio approved the motion, and dismissed the charge.\n\nHowever, the charge against Koonce-Williams could be reintroduced when the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation completes its investigation into the shooting. The shooting was turned over to BCI so authorities could determine if proper protocols and procedures were followed by the officer.\n\nAkron police say Westlake's firing stemmed from incidents unrelated to the Apr. 1 shooting.\n\nWestlake is accused of resting the end of his rifle on the back of a suspect's head as he was being handcuffed on Dec. 31. Additionally, Akron police said Westlake grabbed the man's hair and twisted it to turn his head. Then, On March 1, Westlake was accused of using handcuffs as a pressure point to force a suspect to walk. Authorities say Westlake pulled the woman towards his car. She later fell and reported an injury.\n\nWestlake was charged with Conduct Unbecoming of an Akron Police Officer and violating the Akron Police Division Resisting Arrest/Use of Force Procedure in both incidents.\n\nA closer look into Westlake showed that he was fired from the Akron Police Department in 2021, but was rehired in an agreement with the city and the union. In 2021, Westlake and another officer stopped a vehicle and conducted a search. According to records, Westlake violated the department's policy by using derogatory language that included a homophobic slur.\n\nThe shooting of Koonce-Williams echoes that of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot in 2012 by a Cleveland police officer for carrying a fake gun. Timothy Loehmann fatally shot Rice after police received reports that the boy had a fake gun and pointed it at people at the Cudell Park Recreation Center. Callers had informed police dispatchers that the gun looked fake, but Loehmann shot Rice moments after he exited his vehicle.\n\nCleveland.com and The Plain Dealer reached out to Imokhai Okolo, an attorney representing the family of Koonce-Williams for comment.\n\nWestlake can appeal his termination directly to Akron Mayor Shammas Malik. Malik's office declined to comment on Westlake's termination.\n\n\"I respect the Summit County Prosecutor's decision in this case, and my thoughts are with this young man and his family,\" Malik said of Koonce-Williams.\n\nAttempts to reach Westlake and Akron's Fraternal Order of Police were unsuccessful.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors":

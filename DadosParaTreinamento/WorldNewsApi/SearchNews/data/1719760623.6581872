However, Barcelona believe they have secured the services of a \u201cchampion coach\u201d. \u201cBy bringing Hansi Flick as coach, FC Barcelona have chosen a man well-known for his teams\u2019 high pressing, intense and daring style of play which has brought him great success at club level and international level, winning pretty much all there is to win in the world of football,\u201d read the club statement. The 59-year-old occasionally watched Barcelona matches this season from the presidential box and was linked with the job after Xavi said, in January, that he would depart at the end of a campaign in which they finished runners-up to Real Madrid in La Liga. Barcelona and Xavi decided jointly he would stay for next season after all in April but then Laporta changed his mind and sacked the former midfield great last week. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy at all \u2014 they will suffer and they will need patience because it\u2019s a really difficult job,\u201d Xavi warned his successor last week after winning his final match in charge against Sevilla in La Liga. \u201cThe only thing that can save them is winning, whether they have been part of the club or not.\u201d As well as seeing Madrid win back the Spanish title, Barcelona were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain. Spanish media said Laporta was enraged by Xavi\u2019s comments earlier in May when he highlighted the economic difficulties Barca had when competing against Real and Europe\u2019s other elite clubs.", "summary": "Hansi Flick most recently managed the German national team.", "url": "https://www.the42.ie/former-bayern-boss-takes-charge-at-barcelona-6392636-May2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6392636/river/?height=400&version=6392659", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:28:14", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.151}

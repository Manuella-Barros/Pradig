{"id": 223683448, "title": "Sunak Vows to Bring Back National Service for 18 Year Olds", "text": "Eighteen-year-olds will serve in the military for one year or take up other weekend volunteering roles under the Tories\u2019 plan to bring back national service, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. The pledge marks the first major policy announcement from either side ahead of the July 4 General Election that he called earlier this week. It comes as the idea of conscriptions returned into debates around Europe amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and a threat of war in the Taiwan Strait. Pitching the plan to voters, Mr. Sunak said the policy would help unite society in an \u201cincreasingly uncertain world\u201d and give young people a \u201cshared sense of purpose.\u201d Under the plans, teenagers can sign up for placement in the forces and they would \u201clearn and take part in logistics, cyber security, procurement, or civil response operations,\u201d the Conservative Party said. They can also opt for other volunteering roles within local fire, police, and NHS services, or charities tackling loneliness and supporting elderly, isolated people, for one weekend each month. The party said they would set up a royal commission to work on a proposal on how to ensure the first pilot is open for applications in September 2025. It also said the party would seek to introduce a new \u201cNational Service Act\u201d to make the measures compulsory by the end of the next Parliament, although Home Secretary James Cleverly said there won\u2019t be criminal sanctions for those who don\u2019t take part. In a video published on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday, Mr. Sunak said he\u2019s introducing the plan because Britain \u201cfaces a future that is more dangerous and more divided,\u201d and its \u201cdemocratic values are under threat.\u201d \u201cYoung people will gain valuable skills, make our country more secure, and build a stronger national culture,\u201d he said. The prime minister claimed that 80 percent of young people who completed National Service in Sweden say they would recommend it to their friends, and that the policy \u201cbenefits our country and our young people alike.\u201d Touring broadcast studios on Sunday, Mr. Cleverly said the Tories would ensure the scheme \u201cfits with different people\u2019s attitudes and aspirations\u201d after questions arose over whether teenagers would be punished for not taking part. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be no criminal sanction. There\u2019s no one going to jail over this,\u201d he told Sky News\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning With Trevor Phillips\u201d programme. \u201cThis is about dealing with what we know to be the case, which is social fragmentation,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many young people live in a bubble within their own communities. They don\u2019t mix with people of different religions, they don\u2019t mix with different viewpoints.\u201d The Tories estimate the programme will cost \u00a32.5 billion a year by the end of the decade and plan to fund \u00a31 billion through plans to \u201ccrack down on tax avoidance and evasion.\u201d The remaining \u00a31.5 billion will be paid for with money previously used for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), which is a package to support charities and community groups, the party has said. Promoting the new campaign pledge, the prime minister said Sir Keir Starmer and his Labour Party \u201cdon\u2019t have a clear plan and won\u2019t take the bold action to navigate to a more secure future.\u201d A Labour spokesperson hit back by saying it\u2019s \u201cnot a plan,\u201d but \u201ca review which could cost billions and is only needed because the Tories hollowed out the armed forces to their smallest size since Napoleon.\u201d \u201cBritain has had enough of the Conservatives, who are bankrupt of ideas, and have no plans to end 14 years of chaos. It\u2019s time to turn the page and rebuild Britain with Labour,\u201d the spokesperson added. Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson Richard Foord MP also blamed the Tories for defence cuts, saying, \u201cIf the Conservatives were serious about defence, they would reverse their damaging cuts to our world class professional armed forces, instead of decimating them, with swingeing cuts to the number of our regular service personnel.\u201d Mr. Foord criticised the government for reducing the size of the military, and said the money \u201cwould be far better spent reversing Conservative cuts to troop numbers.\u201d", "summary": "Under the plan, 18 year olds will be required to join the military for a year or help out local emergency services or charities in weekends.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/sunak-vows-to-bring-back-national-service-for-18-year-olds-5520905", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/26/id5657377-Rishi-Sunak-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:27:46", "author": "Lily Zhou", "authors": ["Lily Zhou"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.097}

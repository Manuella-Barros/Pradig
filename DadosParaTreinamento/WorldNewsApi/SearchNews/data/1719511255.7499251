It backfires", "text": "A video showcasing what appears to be a car owner\u2019s fiery retaliation against a repossession agency has gone viral. The TikTok video, posted by user @yungmost, an alleged repossession agent, starts with him filming a vehicle he\u2019s supposed to repo. The footage shows smoke billowing out of the car, obscuring the interior completely. Accompanying the video is an on-screen caption that reads, \u201cWhen you go to do a repo and instead of giving it back, they do this!\u201d As the camera focuses on the smoking vehicle, the repo agent can be heard accusing the ex-car owner of setting the vehicle on fire, \u201cStraight on fire. She didn\u2019t want us to have it, so she straight burnt this [expletive]. Look, like actively on fire.\u201d Originally uploaded on May 22, the video has since quickly gone viral, accumulating 173,600 views and counting, with some users going to the comment section to share their reactions. One user commented, \u201cDo they not realize they are still responsible for the damage?\u201d A second comment pointed out the flawed logic behind the owner\u2019s decision, stating, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, she still owes on the loans. It just means she will have to repay a higher amount now that the car is going to sell for pennies.\u201d But not everyone agreed. A dissenting voice offered: \u201cI\u2019m on her side on this one. Might as well total it out so the corp can\u2019t resell to repeat this profit cycle. Debts still there tho.\u2019 @yungmost When you go to do a repo and this happens.. ##repo##repossession##hookandbook##towing##repoman##fypage##fyp\u30b7\u309aviral##crazycustomer \u266c original sound \u2013 Yung Most The Host Another user asked, \u201cWhat do you do in this scenario? What will insurance do?\u201d @yungmost responded with insight into the repo process: \u201cWell because we already had it repossessed we just keep it then contact the finance company and see what they want to do.\u201d What happens if you trash your car before repossession? Damaging your car before repossession can have serious financial and legal implications.. According to one article, the best course of action is to cooperate: \u201cCreditors can pass along to you the cost of repossessing your vehicle. The more difficult you make it, the more money they have to spend, and the more that could cost you if you want to retain your vehicle.\u201d The article further states, \u201cIf you are served with an order of replevin, a refusal to turn over the car becomes a violation of a court order, not just a refusal to cooperate with a repo man.\u201d The Daily Dot has reached out to @yungmost via TikTok comment.", "summary": "<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/05/Repo-Car-Backfire.jpg?auto=compress&amp;fm=pjpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Car owner gets revenge right before car gets repossessed\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>A video showcasing what appears to be a car owner\u2019s fiery retaliation against a repossession agency has gone viral.

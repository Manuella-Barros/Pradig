Martin Luther King Jr. in protest of white supremacists and other hate groups surfacing across America.\n\nOrganizers urged marchers on Saturday to practice King's values and make sure there was no violence.\n\nA woman was killed and 19 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week after a car plowed into counter-demonstrators at a white nationalist rally.\n\nIn Atlanta, Meredith Dub\u00e9 brought her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub\u00e9 and 12-year-old Rai Chin, 12.\n\nDub\u00e9 is white and her daughters are mixed-race. The 31-year-old says she's taking her daughters to rallies because she thinks it's essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nDallas officials are expecting thousands of people will show up for an evening rally against white supremacy at City Hall plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nSeveral police sharp-shooters could be seen on top of nearby buildings ahead of the 7:30 p.m. rally.\n\nRaymond Simmons, a 48-year-old from Dallas, arrived at the rally wearing a picture of the two Virginia state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling a gathering in Charlottesville supporting that state's Confederate monuments. He says he believes people who engaged in violence there should be charged with treason and the death of the two troopers, as well a woman struck and killed by a car.\n\nAbout a half-dozen people wearing camouflage toted long guns and other weapons as they walked through Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery. They said they were patrolling to make sure there is no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.\n\nHundreds of people have rallied at Southern California beaches to condemn racism in the wake of the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSeveral hundred people rallied Saturday near a lifeguard tower in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles.\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nThe demonstration was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold its own demonstration against illegal immigration in the same spot.\n\nSaturday's demonstrators said they didn't want to confront the other group but counter-demonstrators are expected Sunday and police will be out in force.\n\nA similar anti-racism event was held Saturday near the famed Venice beach boardwalk in Los Angeles.\n\nBoston police say 27 arrests were made during the conservative activist rally and counterdemonstration on Boston Common.\n\nCommissioner William Evans says Saturday's events went off \"as planned,\" with no one hurt or killed. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. Some were for assaulting police officers.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left shortly after their arrival.\n\nEvans and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh praised law enforcement for monitoring the demonstrations, which drew about 40,000 people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is applauding the people in Boston who he says are \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate.\n\nTrump adds in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is complimenting the Boston police on Twitter for their handling of the rallies minutes before the police department tweeted asking people to stop throwing items at them.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday afternoon, \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nTrump also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Police Department tweeted shortly after that urine, rocks and bottles were being thrown at officers and were asking people to refrain from doing so.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left the rally around 1 p.m., shortly after their arrival.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports about 20 arrests had been made.\n\nCounterprotesters have begun to disperse after flooding a conservative activist rally in Boston that ended shortly after it began.\n\nBoston police say Saturday's \"Free Speech Rally\" on the Boston Common has officially ended. Some police officers were still stationed around the State House nearby.\n\nDozens of conservative rallygoers had gathered on the Common, but then left less than an hour after the event was getting underway. Thousands of counterprotesters had also gathered.\n\nA law enforcement official says there were about 20 arrests. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\nMany counterprotesters still remain in the area, including a few who were among people chanting \"Black Lives Matter\" who burned a confederate flag.\n\n\"Free Speech Rally\" organizers have publicly distanced themselves from the white supremacists in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of a conservative activist rally that appeared to end shortly after it began says the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nDozens of rallygoers gathered Saturday on Boston Common, but then left less than an hour after the event was getting underway. Thousands of counterprotesters had also gathered.\n\nTV cameras show police vans escorting participants away, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, tells WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nRallygoers had been met by counterprotesters who marched from to the Common. There have been some confrontations.\n\n\"Free Speech Rally\" organizers have publicly distanced themselves from the white supremacists in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.\n\nParticipants have left the location of a conservative activist rally, leaving behind thousands of counterprotesters.\n\nDozens of rallygoers had gathered on the Boston Common on Saturday, but then left shortly after the event was getting underway. It's unclear if they will gather to rally somewhere else in the city.\n\nRallygoers had been met by counterprotesters who marched from the city's Roxbury neighborhood about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to the Common.\n\nThere have been some confrontations involving counterprotesters, including a group that grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, causing her to stumble and fall to the ground.\n\nOrganizers of the \"Free Speech Rally\" have publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.\n\nConfrontations are happening amid a gathering of counterprotesters and conservative rally participants in Boston.\n\nThousands of demonstrators marched Saturday from the city's Roxbury neighborhood to Boston Common, where the \"Free Speech Rally\" is being held.

Michael W. Waters are addressing the group at City Hall Plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nWaters shouted: \"Now is the time to do what is right in the city of Dallas. Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above. There also was a heavy law enforcement presence at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial. Some citizens toted guns in the cemetery, saying they wanted to protect against possible vandalism.\n\nThe city was expecting thousands of protesters, including counter-protesters.\n\nA diverse crowd of several hundred people marched from downtown Atlanta to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in protest of white supremacists and other hate groups surfacing across America.\n\nOrganizers urged marchers on Saturday to practice King's values and make sure there was no violence.\n\nA woman was killed and 19 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week after a car plowed into counter-demonstrators at a white nationalist rally.\n\nIn Atlanta, Meredith Dub\u00e9 brought her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub\u00e9 and 12-year-old Rai Chin, 12.\n\nDub\u00e9 is white and her daughters are mixed-race. The 31-year-old says she's taking her daughters to rallies because she thinks it's essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nDallas officials are expecting thousands of people will show up for an evening rally against white supremacy at City Hall plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nSeveral police sharp-shooters could be seen on top of nearby buildings ahead of the 7:30 p.m. rally.\n\nRaymond Simmons, a 48-year-old from Dallas, arrived at the rally wearing a picture of the two Virginia state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling a gathering in Charlottesville supporting that state's Confederate monuments. He says he believes people who engaged in violence there should be charged with treason and the death of the two troopers, as well a woman struck and killed by a car.\n\nAbout a half-dozen people wearing camouflage toted long guns and other weapons as they walked through Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery. They said they were patrolling to make sure there is no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.\n\nHundreds of people have rallied at Southern California beaches to condemn racism in the wake of the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSeveral hundred people rallied Saturday near a lifeguard tower in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles.\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nThe demonstration was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold its own demonstration against illegal immigration in the same spot.\n\nSaturday's demonstrators said they didn't want to confront the other group but counter-demonstrators are expected Sunday and police will be out in force.\n\nA similar anti-racism event was held Saturday near the famed Venice beach boardwalk in Los Angeles.\n\nBoston police say 27 arrests were made during the conservative activist rally and counterdemonstration on Boston Common.\n\nCommissioner William Evans says Saturday's events went off \"as planned,\" with no one hurt or killed. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. Some were for assaulting police officers.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left shortly after their arrival.\n\nEvans and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh praised law enforcement for monitoring the demonstrations, which drew about 40,000 people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is applauding the people in Boston who he says are \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate.\n\nTrump adds in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is complimenting the Boston police on Twitter for their handling of the rallies minutes before the police department tweeted asking people to stop throwing items at them.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday afternoon, \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nTrump also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Police Department tweeted shortly after that urine, rocks and bottles were being thrown at officers and were asking people to refrain from doing so.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left the rally around 1 p.m., shortly after their arrival.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports about 20 arrests had been made.\n\nCounterprotesters have begun to disperse after flooding a conservative activist rally in Boston that ended shortly after it began.\n\nBoston police say Saturday's \"Free Speech Rally\" on the Boston Common has officially ended. Some police officers were still stationed around the State House nearby.\n\nDozens of conservative rallygoers had gathered on the Common, but then left less than an hour after the event was getting underway. Thousands of counterprotesters had also gathered.\n\nA law enforcement official says there were about 20 arrests. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\nMany counterprotesters still remain in the area, including a few who were among people chanting \"Black Lives Matter\" who burned a confederate flag.\n\n\"Free Speech Rally\" organizers have publicly distanced themselves from the white supremacists in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of a conservative activist rally that appeared to end shortly after it began says the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nDozens of rallygoers gathered Saturday on Boston Common, but then left less than an hour after the event was getting underway.

The group shouted,\" Take them down,\" referring to the monument.\n\nA large crowd attending a Dallas rally against white supremacy is chanting \"take them down,\" in reference to the city's Confederate statues.\n\nSpeakers including the Rev. Michael W. Waters are addressing the group at City Hall Plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nWaters shouted: \"Now is the time to do what is right in the city of Dallas. Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above. There also was a heavy law enforcement presence at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial. Some citizens toted guns in the cemetery, saying they wanted to protect against possible vandalism.\n\nThe city was expecting thousands of protesters, including counter-protesters.\n\nA diverse crowd of several hundred people marched from downtown Atlanta to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in protest of white supremacists and other hate groups surfacing across America.\n\nOrganizers urged marchers on Saturday to practice King's values and make sure there was no violence.\n\nA woman was killed and 19 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week after a car plowed into counter-demonstrators at a white nationalist rally.\n\nIn Atlanta, Meredith Dub\u00e9 brought her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub\u00e9 and 12-year-old Rai Chin, 12.\n\nDub\u00e9 is white and her daughters are mixed-race. The 31-year-old says she's taking her daughters to rallies because she thinks it's essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nDallas officials are expecting thousands of people will show up for an evening rally against white supremacy at City Hall plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nSeveral police sharp-shooters could be seen on top of nearby buildings ahead of the 7:30 p.m. rally.\n\nRaymond Simmons, a 48-year-old from Dallas, arrived at the rally wearing a picture of the two Virginia state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling a gathering in Charlottesville supporting that state's Confederate monuments. He says he believes people who engaged in violence there should be charged with treason and the death of the two troopers, as well a woman struck and killed by a car.\n\nAbout a half-dozen people wearing camouflage toted long guns and other weapons as they walked through Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery. They said they were patrolling to make sure there is no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.\n\nHundreds of people have rallied at Southern California beaches to condemn racism in the wake of the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSeveral hundred people rallied Saturday near a lifeguard tower in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles.\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nThe demonstration was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold its own demonstration against illegal immigration in the same spot.\n\nSaturday's demonstrators said they didn't want to confront the other group but counter-demonstrators are expected Sunday and police will be out in force.\n\nA similar anti-racism event was held Saturday near the famed Venice beach boardwalk in Los Angeles.\n\nBoston police say 27 arrests were made during the conservative activist rally and counterdemonstration on Boston Common.\n\nCommissioner William Evans says Saturday's events went off \"as planned,\" with no one hurt or killed. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. Some were for assaulting police officers.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left shortly after their arrival.\n\nEvans and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh praised law enforcement for monitoring the demonstrations, which drew about 40,000 people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is applauding the people in Boston who he says are \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate.\n\nTrump adds in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is complimenting the Boston police on Twitter for their handling of the rallies minutes before the police department tweeted asking people to stop throwing items at them.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday afternoon, \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nTrump also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Police Department tweeted shortly after that urine, rocks and bottles were being thrown at officers and were asking people to refrain from doing so.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left the rally around 1 p.m., shortly after their arrival.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports about 20 arrests had been made.\n\nCounterprotesters have begun to disperse after flooding a conservative activist rally in Boston that ended shortly after it began.\n\nBoston police say Saturday's \"Free Speech Rally\" on the Boston Common has officially ended. Some police officers were still stationed around the State House nearby.\n\nDozens of conservative rallygoers had gathered on the Common, but then left less than an hour after the event was getting underway. Thousands of counterprotesters had also gathered.\n\nA law enforcement official says there were about 20 arrests. No serious injuries have been reported.\n\nMany counterprotesters still remain in the area, including a few who were among people chanting \"Black Lives Matter\" who burned a confederate flag.\n\n\"Free Speech Rally\" organizers have publicly distanced themselves from the white supremacists in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of a conservative activist rally that appeared to end shortly after it began says the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nDozens of rallygoers gathered Saturday on Boston Common, but then left less than an hour after the event was getting underway. Thousands of counterprotesters had also gathered.\n\nTV cameras show police vans escorting participants away, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, tells WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nRallygoers had been met by counterprotesters who marched from to the Common.

Police had estimated about 2,300 people attended the rally, but only a few hundred remained by about 9:30 p.m.\n\nTempers flared at Pioneer Park as supporters and opponents of the monument faced off. Police on horseback charged through when a scuffle there broke out. The four people who were pulled over the barrier appeared to be supporters of the monument.\n\nSome of the people on both sides of the clash were carrying weapons, though there was no indication of shots fired.\n\n9 p.m.\n\nDallas police are using horses to try to break up a scuffle at a cemetery between people rallying against white supremacy and supporters of Confederate monuments.\n\nOfficers riding on horseback had waited as the confrontation became more intense, but they moved in to break it up around 9 p.m. It happened at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial to Confederate soldiers.\n\nAbout 2,300 people, according to police estimates, showed up for a rally against racism at City Hall Plaza, not far from the cemetery. The group shouted,\" Take them down,\" referring to the monument.\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nA large crowd attending a Dallas rally against white supremacy is chanting \"take them down,\" in reference to the city's Confederate statues.\n\nSpeakers including the Rev. Michael W. Waters are addressing the group at City Hall Plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nWaters shouted: \"Now is the time to do what is right in the city of Dallas. Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above. There also was a heavy law enforcement presence at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial. Some citizens toted guns in the cemetery, saying they wanted to protect against possible vandalism.\n\nThe city was expecting thousands of protesters, including counter-protesters.\n\n7:35 p.m.\n\nA diverse crowd of several hundred people marched from downtown Atlanta to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in protest of white supremacists and other hate groups surfacing across America.\n\nOrganizers urged marchers on Saturday to practice King's values and make sure there was no violence.\n\nA woman was killed and 19 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week after a car plowed into counter-demonstrators at a white nationalist rally.\n\nIn Atlanta, Meredith Dub\u00e9 brought her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub\u00e9 and 12-year-old Rai Chin, 12.\n\nDub\u00e9 is white and her daughters are mixed-race. The 31-year-old says she's taking her daughters to rallies because she thinks it's essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\n7 p.m.\n\nDallas officials are expecting thousands of people will show up for an evening rally against white supremacy at City Hall plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nSeveral police sharp-shooters could be seen on top of nearby buildings ahead of the 7:30 p.m. rally.\n\nRaymond Simmons, a 48-year-old from Dallas, arrived at the rally wearing a picture of the two Virginia state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling a gathering in Charlottesville supporting that state's Confederate monuments. He says he believes people who engaged in violence there should be charged with treason and the death of the two troopers, as well a woman struck and killed by a car.\n\nAbout a half-dozen people wearing camouflage toted long guns and other weapons as they walked through Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery. They said they were patrolling to make sure there is no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nHundreds of people have rallied at Southern California beaches to condemn racism in the wake of the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSeveral hundred people rallied Saturday near a lifeguard tower in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles.\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nThe demonstration was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold its own demonstration against illegal immigration in the same spot.\n\nSaturday's demonstrators said they didn't want to confront the other group but counter-demonstrators are expected Sunday and police will be out in force.\n\nA similar anti-racism event was held Saturday near the famed Venice beach boardwalk in Los Angeles.\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nBoston police say 27 arrests were made during the conservative activist rally and counterdemonstration on Boston Common.\n\nCommissioner William Evans says Saturday's events went off \"as planned,\" with no one hurt or killed. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. Some were for assaulting police officers.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left shortly after their arrival.\n\nEvans and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh praised law enforcement for monitoring the demonstrations, which drew about 40,000 people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is applauding the people in Boston who he says are \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate.\n\nTrump adds in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\n4 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is complimenting the Boston police on Twitter for their handling of the rallies minutes before the police department tweeted asking people to stop throwing items at them.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday afternoon, \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nTrump also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Police Department tweeted shortly after that urine, rocks and bottles were being thrown at officers and were asking people to refrain from doing so.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left the rally around 1 p.m., shortly after their arrival.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports about 20 arrests had been made.\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nCounterprotesters have begun to disperse after flooding a conservative activist rally in Boston that ended shortly after it began.\n\nBoston police say Saturday's \"Free Speech Rally\" on the Boston Common has officially ended.

Police had estimated about 2,300 people attended the rally, but only a few hundred remained by about 9:30 p.m.\n\nTempers flared at Pioneer Park as supporters and opponents of the monument faced off. Police on horseback charged through when a scuffle there broke out. The four people who were pulled over the barrier appeared to be supporters of the monument.\n\nSome of the people on both sides of the clash were carrying weapons, though there was no indication of shots fired.\n\nDallas police are using horses to try to break up a scuffle at a cemetery between people rallying against white supremacy and supporters of Confederate monuments.\n\nOfficers riding on horseback had waited as the confrontation became more intense, but they moved in to break it up around 9 p.m. It happened at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial to Confederate soldiers.\n\nAbout 2,300 people, according to police estimates, showed up for a rally against racism at City Hall Plaza, not far from the cemetery. The group shouted,\" Take them down,\" referring to the monument.\n\nA large crowd attending a Dallas rally against white supremacy is chanting \"take them down,\" in reference to the city's Confederate statues.\n\nSpeakers including the Rev.

Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above.

The 31-year-old says she's taking her daughters to rallies because she thinks it's essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nDallas officials are expecting thousands of people will show up for an evening rally against white supremacy at City Hall plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nSeveral police sharp-shooters could be seen on top of nearby buildings ahead of the 7:30 p.m. rally.\n\nRaymond Simmons, a 48-year-old from Dallas, arrived at the rally wearing a picture of the two Virginia state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling a gathering in Charlottesville supporting that state's Confederate monuments.

Many yelled at the officers standing watch, and a helicopter circled above.\n\nAt one point, officers pulled four supporters of the monument over a barrier for their protection.\n\nSome of the people on both sides of the clash were carrying weapons, though there was no indication of shots fired. There was a lot of pushing and shoving as the two groups squared off.\n\nEarlier Saturday night, about 2,300 people attended a rally against racism as City Hall plaza nearby.\n\nDallas police officers trying to subdue a crowd at a cemetery housing a Confederate monument have tried to protect four of the demonstrators by pulling them over a barrier in front of the memorial.\n\nThe scuffle at Pioneer Park, a civil war cemetery, happened as a large rally at City Hall plaza nearby was ending. Police had estimated about 2,300 people attended the rally, but only a few hundred remained by about 9:30 p.m.\n\nTempers flared at Pioneer Park as supporters and opponents of the monument faced off. Police on horseback charged through when a scuffle there broke out. The four people who were pulled over the barrier appeared to be supporters of the monument.\n\nSome of the people on both sides of the clash were carrying weapons, though there was no indication of shots fired.\n\nDallas police are using horses to try to break up a scuffle at a cemetery between people rallying against white supremacy and supporters of Confederate monuments.\n\nOfficers riding on horseback had waited as the confrontation became more intense, but they moved in to break it up around 9 p.m. It happened at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial to Confederate soldiers.\n\nAbout 2,300 people, according to police estimates, showed up for a rally against racism at City Hall Plaza, not far from the cemetery. The group shouted,\" Take them down,\" referring to the monument.\n\nA large crowd attending a Dallas rally against white supremacy is chanting \"take them down,\" in reference to the city's Confederate statues.\n\nSpeakers including the Rev. Michael W. Waters are addressing the group at City Hall Plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nWaters shouted: \"Now is the time to do what is right in the city of Dallas. Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above. There also was a heavy law enforcement presence at Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery that houses the memorial. Some citizens toted guns in the cemetery, saying they wanted to protect against possible vandalism.\n\nThe city was expecting thousands of protesters, including counter-protesters.\n\nA diverse crowd of several hundred people marched from downtown Atlanta to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in protest of white supremacists and other hate groups surfacing across America.\n\nOrganizers urged marchers on Saturday to practice King's values and make sure there was no violence.\n\nA woman was killed and 19 others injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week after a car plowed into counter-demonstrators at a white nationalist rally.\n\nIn Atlanta, Meredith Dub brought her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub and 12-year-old Rai Chin, 12.\n\nDub is white and her daughters are mixed-race. The 31-year-old says she's taking her daughters to rallies because she thinks it's essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nDallas officials are expecting thousands of people will show up for an evening rally against white supremacy at City Hall plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial.\n\nSeveral police sharp-shooters could be seen on top of nearby buildings ahead of the 7:30 p.m. rally.\n\nRaymond Simmons, a 48-year-old from Dallas, arrived at the rally wearing a picture of the two Virginia state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while patrolling a gathering in Charlottesville supporting that state's Confederate monuments. He says he believes people who engaged in violence there should be charged with treason and the death of the two troopers, as well a woman struck and killed by a car.\n\nAbout a half-dozen people wearing camouflage toted long guns and other weapons as they walked through Pioneer Park, a Civil War cemetery. They said they were patrolling to make sure there is no vandalism to graves or the Confederate memorial.\n\nHundreds of people have rallied at Southern California beaches to condemn racism in the wake of the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSeveral hundred people rallied Saturday near a lifeguard tower in Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles.\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nThe demonstration was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold its own demonstration against illegal immigration in the same spot.\n\nSaturday's demonstrators said they didn't want to confront the other group but counter-demonstrators are expected Sunday and police will be out in force.\n\nA similar anti-racism event was held Saturday near the famed Venice beach boardwalk in Los Angeles.\n\nBoston police say 27 arrests were made during the conservative activist rally and counterdemonstration on Boston Common.\n\nCommissioner William Evans says Saturday's events went off \"as planned,\" with no one hurt or killed. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct. Some were for assaulting police officers.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday morning on downtown Boston, dwarfing a smaller group of conservatives staging their own \"free speech rally.\" The conservatives left shortly after their arrival.\n\nEvans and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh praised law enforcement for monitoring the demonstrations, which drew about 40,000 people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is applauding the people in Boston who he says are \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate.\n\nTrump adds in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is complimenting the Boston police on Twitter for their handling of the rallies minutes before the police department tweeted asking people to stop throwing items at them.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday afternoon, \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston.

Thousands of leftist counterprotesters marched through downtown Boston on Saturday, chanting anti-Nazi slogans and waving signs condemning white nationalism ahead of a rally being staged by conservative activists a week after a Virginia demonstration turned deadly.\n\nBy Steve LeBlanc, Associated Press\n\nSaturday, Aug. 19, 2017 | 8:07 p.m.\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Thousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged Saturday on downtown Boston in a boisterous repudiation of white nationalism, dwarfing a small group of conservatives who cut short their planned \"free speech rally\" a week after a gathering of hate groups led to bloodshed in Virginia.\n\nCounterprotesters marched through the city to historic Boston Common, where many gathered near a bandstand abandoned early by conservatives who had planned to deliver a series of speeches. Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so.\n\nBoston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made -- mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.\n\nTrump applauded the people in Boston who he said were \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nOrganizers of the event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbor,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.\"\n\nRockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counterprotest to \"show support for the black community and for all minority communities.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nSaturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nRallies in other cities around the country each attracted hundreds of people showing their opposition to white supremacist groups.\n\nCounterprotesters marched through New Orleans, some of them carrying signs that read \"White People Against White Supremacy\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, a diverse crowd marched from the city's downtown to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Meredith Dub\u00e9 brought along her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub\u00e9 and 12-year-old Rai Chin. Dub\u00e9 is white and her daughters are mixed race. She said it is essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nAn anti-racism rally was held in Laguna Beach, California, one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that's being billed as an \"Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.\"\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nIn Dallas, a large crowd attending a rally against white supremacy on Saturday evening called for the city to take down the city's Confederate statues.\n\n\"Now is the time to do what is right in the city of Dallas,\" said the Rev. Michael W. Waters who addressed the group at City Hall Plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial. \"Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback moved in to break up a scuffle between people at the rally and supporters of Confederate monuments.\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above.",

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so.\n\nBoston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made - mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.\n\nTrump applauded the people in Boston who he said were \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nOrganizers of the event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbor,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.\"\n\nRockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counterprotest to \"show support for the black community and for all minority communities.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nSaturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nRallies in other cities around the country each attracted hundreds of people showing their opposition to white supremacist groups.\n\nCounterprotesters marched through New Orleans, some of them carrying signs that read \"White People Against White Supremacy\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, a diverse crowd marched from the city's downtown to the home of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Meredith Dub\u00e9 brought along her two daughters, 2-year-old Willow Dub\u00e9 and 12-year-old Rai Chin. Dub\u00e9 is white and her daughters are mixed race. She said it is essential to show children at an early age that love is more powerful than hate.\n\nAn anti-racism rally was held in Laguna Beach, California, one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that's being billed as an \"Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.\"\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nIn Dallas, a large crowd attending a rally against white supremacy on Saturday evening called for the city to take down the city's Confederate statues.\n\n\"Now is the time to do what is right in the city of Dallas,\" said the Rev. Michael W. Waters who addressed the group at City Hall Plaza, a short distance from the city's Confederate War Memorial. \"Now is the time to bring these monuments down.\"\n\nPolice officers on horseback moved in to break up a scuffle between people at the rally and supporters of Confederate monuments.\n\nPolice officers on horseback monitored the situation, and a police helicopter circulated above.",

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. About 10 minutes before that, President Donald Trump had complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nHe also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made -- mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.\n\nTrump applauded the people in Boston who he said were \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nOrganizers of the conservative event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbor,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.\"\n\nRobert Paulson, another free speech rallygoer, said there was definitely a lot of tension.\n\n\"They believe that we're Nazis and KKK down here. That's what they think, a lot of them. It's not true. A lot of the people down here just love the United States, are here to promote free speech,\" he said.\n\nRockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counterprotest to \"show support for the black community and for all minority communities.\"\n\nKatie Griffiths, a social worker also from Cambridge, who works with members of poor and minority communities, said she finds the hate and violence happening \"very scary.\"\n\n\"I see poor people and people of color being scapegoated,\" she said. \"Unlearned lessons can be repeated.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nYet Saturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nRallies also were planned in cities across the country, including Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at City Hall in Austin, Texas, Saturday morning, holding signs in support of racial equality.\n\nIn Laguna Beach, California, an anti-racism rally was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that's being billed as an \"Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.\"\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nProtesters gathered Saturday outside Trump's private golf club in New Jersey where he recently spent a 17-day vacation.\n\nThe protesters staged a \"No Hate in the Garden State\" rally, with those in attendance sharply rebuking Trump's handling of the protests in Charlottesville. Many also blasted his assertion that \"both sides\" -- the white supremacists and the counterprotesters -- were to blame for the violence that left one protester dead.", "dateTime":

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counter-protesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. About 10 minutes before that, President Donald Trump had complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nHe also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made -- mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.\n\nTrump applauded the people in Boston who he said were \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nOrganizers of the conservative event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counter-demonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counter-protesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" \"Love your neighbor,\" \"Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.\"\n\nRobert Paulson, another free speech rallygoer, said there was definitely a lot of tension.\n\n\"They believe that we're Nazis and KKK down here. That's what they think, a lot of them. It's not true. A lot of the people down here just love the United States, are here to promote free speech,\" he said.\n\nRockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counter-protest to \"show support for the black community and for all minority communities.\"\n\nKatie Griffiths, a social worker also from Cambridge, who works with members of poor and minority communities, said she finds the hate and violence happening \"very scary.\"\n\n\"I see poor people and people of color being scapegoated,\" she said. \"Unlearned lessons can be repeated.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counter-protesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counter-protesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counter-protesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground. Yet Saturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nRallies also were planned in cities across the country, including Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at City Hall in Austin, Texas, Saturday morning, holding signs in support of racial equality.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:52:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1832, "textStart": 1825, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "amb": false}],

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. About 10 minutes before that, President Donald Trump had complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nHe also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made -- mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.\n\nTrump applauded the people in Boston who he said were \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nOrganizers of the conservative event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbor,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.\"\n\nRobert Paulson, another free speech rallygoer, said there was definitely a lot of tension.\n\n\"They believe that we're Nazis and KKK down here. That's what they think, a lot of them. It's not true. A lot of the people down here just love the United States, are here to promote free speech,\" he said.\n\nRockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counterprotest to \"show support for the black community and for all minority communities.\"\n\nKatie Griffiths, a social worker also from Cambridge, who works with members of poor and minority communities, said she finds the hate and violence happening \"very scary.\"\n\n\"I see poor people and people of color being scapegoated,\" she said. \"Unlearned lessons can be repeated.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nYet Saturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nRallies also were planned in cities across the country, including Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at City Hall in Austin, Texas, Saturday morning, holding signs in support of racial equality.\n\nIn Laguna Beach, California, an anti-racism rally was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that's being billed as an \"Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.\"\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nProtesters gathered Saturday outside Trump's private golf club in New Jersey where he recently spent a 17-day vacation.\n\nThe protesters staged a \"No Hate in the Garden State\" rally, with those in attendance sharply rebuking Trump's handling of the protests in Charlottesville. Many also blasted his assertion that \"both sides\" -- the white supremacists and the counterprotesters -- were to blame for the violence that left one protester dead.", "dateTime":

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. About 10 minutes before that, President Donald Trump had complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nHe also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nBoston Commissioner William Evans said 27 arrests were made -- mostly for disorderly conduct while some were for assaulting police officers. Officials said the rallies drew about 40,000 people.\n\nTrump applauded the people in Boston who he said were \"speaking out\" against bigotry and hate. Trump added in a Twitter message that \"Our country will soon come together as one!\"\n\nOrganizers of the conservative event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbor,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers. And we have no intention of violence.\"\n\nRobert Paulson, another free speech rallygoer, said there was definitely a lot of tension.\n\n\"They believe that we're Nazis and KKK down here. That's what they think, a lot of them. It's not true. A lot of the people down here just love the United States, are here to promote free speech,\" he said.\n\nRockeem Robinson, a youth counselor from Cambridge, said he joined the counterprotest to \"show support for the black community and for all minority communities.\"\n\nKatie Griffiths, a social worker also from Cambridge, who works with members of poor and minority communities, said she finds the hate and violence happening \"very scary.\"\n\n\"I see poor people and people of color being scapegoated,\" she said. \"Unlearned lessons can be repeated.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nYet Saturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nRallies also were planned in cities across the country, including Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at City Hall in Austin, Texas, Saturday morning, holding signs in support of racial equality.\n\nIn Laguna Beach, California, an anti-racism rally was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that's being billed as an \"Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.\"\n\nMayor Toni Iselman told the crowd that \"Laguna Beach doesn't tolerate diversity, we embrace diversity.\"\n\nProtesters gathered Saturday outside Trump's private golf club in New Jersey where he recently spent a 17-day vacation.\n\nThe protesters staged a \"No Hate in the Garden State\" rally, with those in attendance sharply rebuking Trump's handling of the protests in Charlottesville. Many also blasted his assertion that \"both sides\" -- the white supremacists and the counterprotesters -- were to blame for the violence that left one protester dead.", "dateTime":

Nor did his second attempt.\n\nWhile the president tried to address protests and counter-protests across the country, he made a typo, writing \"heel\" instead of \"heal\" -- twice.\n\nIn his first tweet he wrote: \"Our great country has been divided for decade, but it will come together again.Sometimes protest is needed in order to heel,and heel we will!\"\n\nThat was swiftly deleted and replaced with: \"Our great country has been divided for decades. Somtimes you need protest in order to heel, & we will heel, & be stronger than ever before!\"\n\nBut then he noticed his spelling error and sent out the message again, but with heal instead of heel.\n\nDespite deleting the messages plenty of people saw the original and took to Twitter to mock the New York businessman.\n\n\"Third time's a charm,\" one user joked. Another commented \"heel' is the new 'covfefe'.\n\nEven Merrian Webster dictionary got in on the action, writing: \"heal (to become healthy again), heel (a contemptible person), he'll (he will).\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has been roasted online for his tweets.\n\nHe baffled the world in June after tweeting \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe.\"\n\nAnd despite the tweet being ridiculed online it remained on his Twitter feed for over five hours before being deleted at around 5:45am Washington DC time.\n\nThe firebrand Republican then posted his light-hearted response: \"Who can figure out the true meaning of \"covfefe\" ??? Enjoy!\"\n\nTrump's latest tweets were in response to a protest in Boston following Charlottesville white supremacist rally wherea a motorist mowed down and killed a protester.\n\nThousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged on downtown Boston in a to protest \"white nationalism\" a week after a woman was killed in Charlottesville, Virgina.\n\nThe amount of counterprotesters dwarfed a small group of conservatives who cut short their planned free speech rally.\n\nAn estimated 15,000 counter protesters marched through the city to historic Boston Common, where many gathered near a bandstand abandoned early by conservatives who had planned to deliver a series of speeches.\n\nPolice vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nAt least 27 people were arrested at the rally where members of the Black Lives Matter movement set fire to a confederate flag.\n\nBoston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so.\n\nAbout 10 minutes before that, President Donald Trump had complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nHe also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nOrganisers of the midday event, billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" have publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.\n\nA woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and scores of others were injured, when a car ploughed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the spectre of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville.\n\nBut only a few dozen conservatives turned out for the rally on historic Boston Common in stark contrast to the estimated 15,000 counterprotesters and the conservatives abruptly left early.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realise \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counterprotesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces.\n\nThey chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbour,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\"\n\nOthers carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counterprotesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him.\n\nBut other counterprotesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged.\n\nBlack-clad counterprotesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nYet Saturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organised the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organisers in any way.\n\n\"We are strictly about free speech,\" the group said on its Facebook page. \"We denounce the politics of supremacy and violence.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:14:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3177, "textStart": 3170, "imp": true,

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counter-protesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle. At least one person was arrested. In total, about 20 arrests were made, according to The Boston Globe.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, Boston's police department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them and asked people publicly to refrain from doing so. About 10 minutes before that, President Donald Trump had complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\" He also complimented Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\nOrganizers of the conservative event, which had been billed as a \"Free Speech Rally,\" had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that Unite the Right rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counter-demonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering in a major U.S. city since Charlottesville. But only a few dozen conservatives turned out for the rally on historic Boston Common and left early.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative activist rally said the event \"fell apart.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Samson Racioppi, who was among several slated to speak, told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nSome counter-protesters dressed entirely in black and wore bandannas over their faces. They chanted anti-Nazi and anti-fascism slogans, and waved signs that said: \"Make Nazis Afraid Again,\" ''Love your neighbor,\" ''Resist fascism\" and \"Hate never made U.S. great.\" Others carried a large banner that read: \"SMASH WHITE SUPREMACY.\"\n\n\"I came out today to show support for the black community and for all minority communities,\" said Rockeem Robinson, 21, a youth counselor from Cambridge.\n\nHe said he wasn't concerned about his personal safety because he felt more support on his side.\n\nKatie Griffiths, 48, a social worker also from Cambridge, who works with members of poor and minority communities, said she finds the hate and violence happening \"very scary.\"\n\n\"I see poor people and people of color being scapegoated,\" she said. \"Unlearned lessons can be repeated.\"\n\nTV cameras showed a group of boisterous counter-protesters on the Common chasing a man with a Trump campaign banner and cap, shouting and swearing at him. But other counter-protesters intervened and helped the man safely over a fence into the area where the conservative rally was to be staged. Black-clad counter-protesters also grabbed an American flag out of an elderly woman's hands, and she stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\nYet Saturday's showdown was mostly peaceable, and after demonstrators dispersed, a picnic atmosphere took over with stragglers tossing beach balls, banging on bongo drums and playing reggae music.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition, which organized the event, said it has nothing to do with white nationalism or racism and its group is not affiliated with the Charlottesville rally organizers in any way.\n\nDating to 1634, Boston Common is the nation's oldest city park. The leafy downtown park is popular with locals and tourists and has been the scene of numerous rallies and protests for centuries.\n\nRallies also were planned in cities across the country, including Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at City Hall in Austin, Texas, Saturday morning, holding signs in support of racial equality. The Austin American-Statesmen reported organizers for the Rally Against White Supremacy estimated about 1,200 people were in attendance.\n\nIn Laguna Beach, California, a small anti-racism rally was held one day before the group America First! planned to hold a demonstration in the same place that's being billed as an \"Electric Vigil for the Victims of Illegals and Refugees.\"\n\nOrganizers said they held a separate gathering in order to avoid a confrontation. Several hundred people showed up Saturday. They held signs with a variety of messages, from \"Black Lives Matter\" to \"Respect Earth.\" One said: \"Make America Human Again.\" Participants also were urged to tie colored ribbons around trees and lamp posts to symbolize unity.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:29:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 81, "textStart": 74, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1590,

Police vans later escorted the conservatives out of the area, and angry counterprotesters scuffled with armed officers trying to maintain order.\n\nMembers of the Black Lives Matter movement later protested on the Common, where a Confederate flag was burned and protesters pounded on the sides of a police vehicle. In all, 27 arrests were made, according to police, and the rallies drew as many as 40,000 people.\n\nLater Saturday, Boston's Police Department tweeted that protesters were throwing bottles, urine and rocks at them. President Trump complimented Boston police, tweeting: \"Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston. Police are looking tough and smart! Thank you.\"\n\nOrganizers of the conservative event had publicly distanced themselves from the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others who fomented violence in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12. A woman was killed at that \"Unite the Right\" rally, and many others were injured, when a car plowed into counterdemonstrators.\n\nOpponents feared that white nationalists might show up in Boston anyway, raising the specter of ugly confrontations in the first potentially large and racially charged gathering since Charlottesville. But only a few dozen conservatives turned out for the rally on historic Boston Common and left early.\n\nOne of the planned speakers of the conservative rally said the event \"fell apart.\" Congressional candidate Samson Racioppi told WCVB-TV that he didn't realize \"how unplanned of an event it was going to be.\"\n\nChris Hood, a free speech rally attendee from Dorchester, said people were unfairly making it seem like the rally was going to be \"a white supremacist Klan rally.\"\n\n\"That was never the intention,\" he said. \"We've only come here to promote free speech on college campuses, free speech on social media for conservative, right-wing speakers.

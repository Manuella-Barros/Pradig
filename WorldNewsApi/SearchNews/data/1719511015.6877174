The One Tree Hill alum took to her Instagram story on Saturday 25 May where she showed off photos of the two of them in France near the Eiffel Tower where Bush strategically hid her fingers from sight, causing many fans to turn to TikTok making the announcement that the two were now engaged. Shortly after Bush took to her Instagram story a second time to mention that she is aware of all the rumors the photo caused. Showing a selfie of her sitting in the car, the actress made a peace sign with text across the screen that read, \u201cI hear the internet is being wild?\u201d \u201cY\u2019all\u2026 I have no \u2018news\u2019 for you. Wouldn\u2019t you put your hands all up in her jacket if you could??\u201d \u201cTo be clear, you can\u2019t because boundaries,\u201d she joked. \u201cBut I\u2019ll continue to do it for you because I\u2019m just generous like that.\u201d The actress went on to post another photo of the two of them together with the text caption reading, \u201cI just wanna squeeeeeeeeeze her.\u201d \u201cI get that it\u2019s new for y\u2019all to see me so happy and so embodied. It\u2019s new for me too. How lucky am I?\u201d Following initial rumors that the two were in a relationship, Bush didn\u2019t publicly speak out about it until April in an essay that she wrote for Glamour where she noted that her 13-month marriage to Grant Hughes did not end because of Harris, and that something was off about it from the start. \u201cIn April of 2022 I was close to calling off my wedding. Instead of running away, I doubled down on being a model wife,\u201d her essay published by the outlet began. Through talking about her divorce with a group of women, one of whom being Harris, the two ended up falling in love. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to find love in this support system. I don\u2019t know how else to say it other than: I didn\u2019t see it until I saw it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s very easy not to see something that\u2019s been in front of your face for a long time when you\u2019d never looked at it as an option and you had never been looked at as an option. What I saw was a friend with her big, happy life. And now I know she thought the same thing about me.\u201d The essay at the time even included some of the qualities she likes the most about Harris. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my place to discuss details of Ashlyn\u2019s circumstances or her children, but I will say that I am absolutely in awe of her relentless integrity. The way she prioritizes and centers her kids, not only in her life but in the core of her being, is breathtaking to behold,\u201d Bush said. \u201cFalling in love with her has sutured some of my own childhood wounds, and made me so much closer to my own mother. Seeing Ashlyn choose to not simply survive, but thrive, for her babies has been the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed a friend do. And now I get to love her.

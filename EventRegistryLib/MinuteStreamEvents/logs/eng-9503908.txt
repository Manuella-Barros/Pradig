In early April, GPS points stopped uploading and very recently those points began to upload again.\n\n\"The biological interpretation of this is that she was likely in a den during the time when connectivity with the collar was interrupted, which aligns with the expected timing of wolf reproduction,\" Davis wrote to the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association after they sent letters to Gov. Jared Polis and the Parks and Wildlife commissioners on April 18 and April 24 demanding CPW kill the wolves before they kill more cattle.\n\nIf the pieces add up, this will be the first offspring from wolves reintroduced to Colorado. CPW is working to confirm the den.\n\nIn June 2021, a state biologist and a district wildlife officer observed a litter of pups in Jackson County. They were the first gray wolf pups recorded since the species was extirpated in Colorado 80 years before.\n\nTheir parents included a collared female that migrated from the Snake River pack in Wyoming in 2019 and a male that Colorado wildlife officials darted and outfitted with a tracking collar in February 2021. As has occurred with the Grand County wolves, biologists observed that April that the female had retreated to a den.\n\nWhen the first five wolves captured from packs in Oregon were released in southwestern Grand County in December, Colorado Parks and Wildlife biologists gave detailed information about the age, sex and color of each animal. The group included two yearling females that they said may have been too young to breed.\n\nA second group was released in secret a few days later on state-owned land in Summit and Grand counties.\n\nIn total, six yearling females were released.\n\nThe wolf found dead in Larimer County appears to have died from natural causes, though a necropsy to determine the cause of its death is being conducted, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said on Tuesday. The agency did not say what gender the animal was.\n\nIn his letter to the stockgrowers, Davis was adamant about not killing the male wolf, which is one of two that have been killing cattle in Grand County.\n\nKilling the male would be at odds with the voter-directed goals of wolf reintroduction. The state's detailed plan suggests the species will be considered recovered when there are about 200 wolves in 25 packs across the state.\n\n\"Removing the male breeder at this point would be irresponsible management and potentially cause the den to fail, possibly resulting in the death of the presumed pups,\" he wrote. \"This is not a desirable result and I am therefore not going to take action at this time to lethally remove this animal.\"\n\nGrand County Commissioner Merrit Linke declined to comment on the letter late Monday evening, saying he was \"still thinking about it.\" But earlier in the day he and the other commissioners sent their own letter to Gov. Jared Polis saying they \"stand united\" with the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association in requesting the offending wolves be killed.\n\nDavis cleared up one additional issue in his letter, that of the stockgrowers' insisting that the reintroduced wolves came from depredating packs in Oregon.\n\n\"While the wolves that were selected for reintroduction may have come from packs that were historically chronically depredating packs, management action was taken in Oregon and in the months leading up to capture prior to translocation to Colorado, the packs were not implicated in depredation,\" he said. \"To continue to state that we brought known problem wolves into the state is a falsehood. Where wolves and livestock share the landscape, there will be conflict. We will hold tight to the recommendations of the Technical Working Group and what is stated in our plan that we will not bring currently chronically depredating wolves into the state.\"\n\nDavis acknowledged the challenges for the Middle Park stockgrowers but said the agency would not be killing any wolves in the near future. He cited rules in the nearly 300-page Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan that dictate CPW must \"evaluate the use of lethal control on a context-specific basis.\"\n\nDetermining factors include the ability to target depredating wolves, the efficiency and effectiveness of conflict minimization, financial cost, wolf reproductive and recruitment success, wolf population size and listing status, impacts to livestock owners, and social/stakeholder interests when considering lethal take options.\n\nAs with all wolf management practices, he wrote, \"lethal control will only be implemented when in compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations.\"\n\nThe wolf restoration plan was developed over two years of meetings held statewide. The plan calls for phased management that can be adjusted as wolf populations grow in the state. In the restoration process, CPW also was granted the designation of an experimental population under section 10(j) of the federal Endangered Species Act to provide increased flexibility to manage wolves once they were reintroduced to Colorado, including killing wolves that prey on livestock. Gray wolves are considered endangered in 44 states.\n\nBut Davis said the wolf population in Colorado is currently \"far below any restoration goal,\" and that CPW has \"the legal duty to establish a self-sustaining population of wolves while minimizing conflict risk.\"\n\n\"As the wolf population in Colorado grows, and as we get to points where we enter different management phases, the approach to lethal removals will likely become more liberal,\" he added.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers Association and the North Park Stockgrowers Association in their letters earlier this week compared CPW's wolf management practices to those of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, where Davis worked for 23 years before joining CPW in March of 2023. The ranchers said by Washington's definition, \"chronic depredation is demonstrably occurring in Grand County.\"\n\nColorado's plan does not include a definition of chronic depredation.\n\nDavis said that while other states have quantitative metrics to define chronic depredation, \"it is important to understand that simply meeting that metric does not necessarily initiate lethal removal.\"\n\n\"An evaluation of the circumstances, including an evaluation of the status of the entire wolf population, informs decisions on wolf management,\" he added. \"As you are aware, Colorado's Wolf Restoration and Management Plan does not have a quantitative definition of what constitutes chronic depredation. This was intentional, and results directly from the recommendations of the Stakeholder Advisory Group. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission will be considering whether it is advisable to modify the plan to quantitatively define chronic depredation, and if so what that definition should be, at the commission meetings this summer.\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tracy_ross@coloradosun.com", "name": "Tracy Ross",

So far this year, the state has listed four confirmed depredations. Three were in Grand County, and one in Jackson, but all were reported in April.\n\nCPW said the list will be updated each time staff investigate and confirm a new depredation event. The goal is to keep the public informed about what CPW has investigated regarding the wolves.\n\nThe webpage lists when the wolf attack occurred, what county it was recorded in, whether a claim was submitted, and how many cattle or calves were involved. The state report shows that so far this year, two calves and four cattle have been involved in depredation events.\n\nIt does not list whether the wolf was a reintroduced wolf or a wolf that has migrated into the state, but does link to pertinent press releases that state whether the wolf was one of the 10 reintroduced over the winter.\n\nThe webpage also lists how much each rancher was given as compensation for the lost livestock. For example, a depredation event recorded on March 13, 2023, in Jackson County regarding a dog, resulted in one resident receiving $15,000. The state will reimburse livestock producers with the fair market value of the livestock when a claim is submitted and CPW confirms the gray wolf involvement.\n\nCurrently, the list goes back to December 2021, citing only three incidents that were reported outside of Jackson County, and all three occurred in April of this year.\n\nSeveral stockgrower and ranching associations, along with the Grand County Sheriff, called on the state to lethally remove wolves depredating livestock. The state called the action \"premature.\"\n\nWolf movement shared through watershed maps\n\nCPW has been sharing maps of the watersheds that the gray wolves' GPS collar data puts them in, but not sharing more specific locations to help keep the population safe.\n\nThe map data is provided through the GPS collars that are still working -- two of the original 10 have failed since the beginning of March. However, the CPW biologists say the animals whose collars have failed are traveling with wolves with functional collars, allowing them to be monitored.\n\nCPW said it knows the wolves with nonfunctional collars are still alive because they viewed the animals from an airplane.\n\nHowever, one of the two dead wolves found recently in Colorado was discovered to be one of the 10 reintroduced wolves, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf was discovered in Larimer County and will be federally investigated because wolves are listed in the Endangered Species Act.\n\nCPW's movement map shows that the reintroduced wolves have been found in watersheds east of the Continental Divide and onto the Front Range. The wolves have been recorded in watersheds surrounding Estes Park and in watersheds that almost entirely cover Jackson and Grand counties.\n\nIn their requests for wolves to be lethally removed, the Larimer County Stock Growers Association said they believe the eight counties where collared wolves have been recorded have approximately 5% of the state's livestock population.\n\nThese counties were also areas that voted against the measure to reintroduce wolves. The group said these counties' livestock production provides over $158 million in economic impact to the state.", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heather_willard@kdvr.com", "name": "Heather Willard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Parks and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drainage basin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Divide of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Fish and Wildlife Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larimer_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larimer County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larimer County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estes Park, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Estes Park, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Maps", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Maps", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/12/657d11310914e9.54300926.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503908", "eventUri": "eng-9503908", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-03-", "textStart": 1310, "textEnd": 1318}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

That's up from 216 wolves in 37 packs the previous year.\n\n\"Recovery is happening right before our eyes,\" said Ben Maletzke, statewide wolf specialist at the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nMaletzke presented the state's annual wolf report during a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Saturday. The results are likely an undercount because of the difficulty identifying every animal in the state, especially lone wolves without a pack.\n\nThe 2023 increase follows steady upward trends since the first Department of Fish and Wildlife survey in 2008. The gray wolf population has grown by an average of 23% every year since then, according to the agency.\n\nThe increase has led the agency to consider lowering gray wolves' protection status from \"endangered\" to \"sensitive\" under state law. Environmentalists say the move is premature.\n\nEven if the state makes the policy change, wolves would still be protected in the western two-thirds of Washington under the federal Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Commission is expected to decide on the reclassification in July.\n\nThe decision would be another step in the long-controversial management of wolves in Washington since the first breeding pack was confirmed in 2008. Environmentalists say the state is not doing enough to protect the endangered animals while ranchers say the state is not doing enough to protect their livestock, which wolves can injure or kill.\n\n\"The department says reducing wolf protections would show it's making progress towards recovery, but this report tells a different story,\" Amaroq Weiss, a senior wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.\n\nThe annual report shows a continued lack of wolves in western Washington and fewer breeding pairs than in previous years, she added. Last year, 25 of the state's wolf packs were considered successful breeding pairs, down one pair from 2022.\n\nWolf populations have steadily increased in eastern Washington and the northern Cascades. But Weiss said the state should not consider downlisting wolves until they've established territories in other parts of the state where they historically roamed, including from the southern Cascades to the northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula.\n\nMaletzke said there were signs of wolves gaining more of a foothold in western Washington last year. One known wolf spent significant time there, likely looking for a mate, and more wolves began to move south of Interstate 90.\n\n\"This likely means it is only a matter of time before new packs begin to establish in that recovery region,\" Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said in a statement.\n\nThree dozen wolves died across the state in 2023, one fewer than last year, according to the report.\n\nMost of those deaths were from legal tribal hunting. Vehicles hit and killed five wolves, a cougar killed one. Another four were killed illegally, and those deaths are still under investigation.\n\nThe number of wolves killed following livestock conflicts - one of the most controversial pieces of wolf management - was also down in 2023. In 2022, nine wolves were killed by either the state or ranchers following a conflict with livestock.\n\nAccording to the 2023 report, only three wolves were killed because of livestock conflicts. Two were killed by the state, and one by a livestock owner.\n\nNine of the 42 known wolf packs, about 21%, were involved in at least one confirmed or probable conflict with livestock last year.\n\n\"The majority of the packs out there aren't involved in conflicts even though they overlap with livestock,\" Maletzke said. \"That's promising.\"\n\nBut, he added, that doesn't come without a cost.\n\nThe state estimates it spent more than $1.6 million last year on wolf management. More than $1.3 million of that went to research. The rest pays for lost livestock, lethal removal of wolves, and efforts to prevent wolf-livestock conflicts.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act_of_1973", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Endangered Species Act of 1973"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Washington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cascade Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Biological_Diversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Biological Diversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 90"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cougar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Pigs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Pigs", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/washington_state_standard_articles_884/998d330ada836cfa1613ca06630ba06d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503908", "eventUri": "eng-9503908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

That's an increase of about 20% over 2023, and it marks the 15th consecutive year that the number of wolves has grown.\n\nWhile up from the 216 wolves counted in 2023, the number of breeding pairs, which raised at least two pups through the end of 2023, was down by one from 2023 to 25.\n\nThe vast majority of the wolves live in Eastern Washington, although a few have begun to be seen across the Cascades, which is key for the state's recovery effort.\n\n\"Although the first pack to recolonize the South Cascades and Northwest Coast recovery region only had one wolf during the year end counts in 2023, we have observed multiple collared wolves south of Interstate 90 in the last year,\" WDFW Director Kelly Susewind said in a news release. \"This likely means it is only a matter of time before new packs begin to establish in that recovery region.\"\n\nJust to the east in Idaho, the Gem State is home to about 1,337 wolves. However, that was based on 2022 numbers.\n\nReached Tuesday, Rick Ward, state wildlife manager for the Idaho Fish and Game, said the wolf survey results for 2023 are not expected to be released until July.\n\nBut last year, former Idaho Fish and Game Director Ed Schriever, who retired in February, noted that the 1,337 wolves estimated to be living in the Gem State for 2022 was too high for state wildlife managers.\n\n\"There's been a concerted effort by Fish and Game staff, hunters, trappers and other partners and agencies to reduce wolf conflicts with livestock and bring the wolf population in balance with prey species, particularly elk,\" Schriever said in a January 2023 news release. \"We are encouraged by efforts that have resulted in a drop in wolf numbers, and this aligns with our long-term goal to reduce Idaho's wolf population.\n\n\"We'd like to see it fluctuate around 500, which is outlined in our draft wolf management plan and aligns with the federal rule that delisted wolves,\" Schriever said.\n\nWolves had been hunted to near extinction in the early 1900s. But they were reintroduced in Idaho in 1995 and Washington in 2008.\n\nSince then, their recovery has continued to spark controversy between groups such as cattlemen associations that argue states don't do enough to protect the livestock industry and naturalists, who push to allow for natural balance for the nation's wild places.\n\nWashington's statewide wolf specialist Ben Maletzke noted that while the number of the state's wolves continues to grow, the state did not have corresponding livestock losses.\n\nThe state had 23 \"confirmed or probable\" depredation events in 2023, and some 78% of the known packs were not involved in any of livestock attacks. Some nine were implicated in at least one confirmed or probable attack, and only two packs had two or more livestock attacks, according to the release.\n\n\"Livestock producers have worked closely with WDFW staff in the past year, along with community partners and range riders, to use non-lethal methods to discourage wolves from negatively interacting with domestic animals,\" Maletzke said in the release. \"These proactive and reactive efforts require significant investments in time and resources by livestock operators and others but have reduced the number of wolf depredations and lethal removal of wolves.\"\n\nWashington released the first-ever status review for wolves in the state and recommended wolves be reclassified to sensitive status based on significant progress toward recovery objectives. The Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission is expected to make a decision on the reclassification proposal in July.\n\nBut wolf recovery supporter Amaroq Weiss, a senior wolf advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, criticized Washington policy makers for seeking to reduce wolf protections.\n\n\"The department says reducing wolf protections would show it's making progress towards recovery, but this report tells a different story,\" Weiss said in a news release. \"Real progress requires a continued commitment to provide strong protections to wolves so they can safely disperse into all three recovery regions and establish territories and families there.\"\n\nShe noted that the state reported that at least 36 wolves died in 2023.\n\nOf those, three were killed for livestock conflicts. Another 22 died from tribal hunting by the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, which retain tribal treaty rights for hunting on their reservation. Some five wolves died from vehicle strikes, and one was killed by a cougar.\n\nOf the remaining five known deaths, four remain under investigation and one died of unknown causes.\n\nWashington's wolf plan divides the state into three recovery regions with breeding pair population objectives designated for each. Currently, no breeding pairs have yet been established in the third recovery region, which encompasses the southern Cascades and north coast.\n\nWeiss argued that if the state wildlife managers succeed in reducing state wolf protections, it could lead to more permits for ranchers to kill or injure wolves and fewer habitat protections.\n\n\"Even the state knows that some of Washington's best wolf habitat is in the third recovery region in the western portions of the state,\" Weiss said. \"I'm pleased to see the agency greatly reduced its own killing of wolves this year, but with 36 deaths, fewer breeding pairs and none at all in the third recovery region, wolves still need protection.\n\n\"Instead of bending to political pressure from wolf opponents,\" she continued, \"the department should continue to focus on nonlethal prevention measures and education.\"\n\nEarlier this year, federal officials announced that they declined to restore protections to wolves in the western U.S. after finding that the animals are not in danger of extinction.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in February it was rejecting petitions seeking Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves. The finding kept management of the species under state control in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of eastern Oregon and Washington.\n\nThe agency also said it would begin work on a nationwide recovery plan for the species, which is listed as endangered in 44 states and as threatened in Minnesota. Work on that plan is expected to be completed by Dec. 12, 2025.\n\nThe public can submit comments on the department's proposal until midnight on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType":

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)\n\nWashington's wolf population increased by 20% last year, the 15th year in a row that the number of endangered gray wolves in the state has grown, according to new state figures.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Washington had 260 wolves in 42 packs. That's up from 216 wolves in 37 packs the previous year.\n\n\"Recovery is happening right before our eyes,\" said Ben Maletzke, statewide wolf specialist at the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nMaletzke presented the state's annual wolf report during a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Saturday. The results are likely an undercount because of the difficulty identifying every animal in the state, especially lone wolves without a pack.\n\nThe 2023 increase follows steady upward trends since the first Department of Fish and Wildlife survey in 2008. The gray wolf population has grown by an average of 23% every year since then, according to the agency.\n\nThe increase has led the agency to consider lowering gray wolves' protection status from \"endangered\" to \"sensitive\" under state law. Environmentalists say the move is premature.\n\nEven if the state makes the policy change, wolves would still be protected in the western two-thirds of Washington under the federal Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Commission is expected to decide on the reclassification in July.\n\nThe decision would be another step in the long-controversial management of wolves in Washington since the first breeding pack was confirmed in 2008. Environmentalists say the state is not doing enough to protect the endangered animals while ranchers say the state is not doing enough to protect their livestock, which wolves can injure or kill.\n\n\"The department says reducing wolf protections would show it's making progress towards recovery, but this report tells a different story,\" Amaroq Weiss, a senior wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.\n\nThe annual report shows a continued lack of wolves in western Washington and fewer breeding pairs than in previous years, she added. Last year, 25 of the state's wolf packs were considered successful breeding pairs, down one pair from 2022.\n\nWolf populations have steadily increased in eastern Washington and the northern Cascades. But Weiss said the state should not consider downlisting wolves until they've established territories in other parts of the state where they historically roamed, including from the southern Cascades to the northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula.\n\nMaletzke said there were signs of wolves gaining more of a foothold in western Washington last year. One known wolf spent significant time there, likely looking for a mate, and more wolves began to move south of Interstate 90.\n\n\"This likely means it is only a matter of time before new packs begin to establish in that recovery region,\" Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said in a statement.\n\n'Promising' wolf-livestock conflict data\n\nThree dozen wolves died across the state in 2023, one fewer than last year, according to the report.\n\nMost of those deaths were from legal tribal hunting. Vehicles hit and killed five wolves, a cougar killed one. Another four were killed illegally, and those deaths are still under investigation.\n\nThe number of wolves killed following livestock conflicts - one of the most controversial pieces of wolf management - was also down in 2023. In 2022, nine wolves were killed by either the state or ranchers following a conflict with livestock.\n\nAccording to the 2023 report, only three wolves were killed because of livestock conflicts. Two were killed by the state, and one by a livestock owner.\n\nNine of the 42 known wolf packs, about 21%, were involved in at least one confirmed or probable conflict with livestock last year.\n\n\"The majority of the packs out there aren't involved in conflicts even though they overlap with livestock,\" Maletzke said. \"That's promising.\"\n\nBut, he added, that doesn't come without a cost.\n\nThe state estimates it spent more than $1.6 million last year on wolf management. More than $1.3 million of that went to research. The rest pays for lost livestock, lethal removal of wolves, and efforts to prevent wolf-livestock conflicts.\n\nThese efforts have kept the number of conflicts with livestock low compared to the population growth over time, Maletzke said.\n\nThis story was produced by the Washington State Standard which is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network, including the Daily Montanan, supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

That list includes depredations dates, the county they occurred in and how much the livestock producer was compensated or if a claim involving a confirmed kill has not been submitted.\n\nWhy wolf activity may be expanding more into Larimer County\n\nThe latest map shows wolf activity March 26 through April 23 expanding eastward in watersheds encompassing roughly the western three-fourths of Larimer County. That includes just east of U.S. Highway 287 north of Fort Collins and south to U.S. Highway 34 west of Loveland.\n\nThe map is created using tracking collars on the 12 known wolves in Colorado, including 10 released wolves in December and two from the remaining North Park pack.\n\nTwo collars on the released wolves are no longer providing signals to biologists, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said.\n\nThe wolves with the failed collars are traveling with other animals with functional collars, which currently allows state wildlife biologists to monitor those animals, the wildlife agency said in a news release. The agency has confirmed the animals with the malfunctioning collars are still alive based on visual confirmation from an airplane.\n\nThe map is broken down by watersheds, which can be large. If a wolf collar indicates it was or is in that watershed, the entire watershed is marked as having wolves in it at some point in the last month. It does not necessarily mean a wolf or wolves are currently in those areas.\n\nOne of the 10 wolves captured in Oregon and released in Grand and Summit counties was found deceased in Larimer County on April 18 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was made aware of the death.\n\nIt was the first death of the 10 released wolves.\n\nThe expansion of wolf activity could be related to the movement of the deceased wolf. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not identified the exact location of the deceased wolf.\n\nThe federal agency and Colorado Parks and Wildlife are investigating the cause of the wolf's death, which preliminarily is labeled as natural causes.\n\nThe only other known collared wolf near Larimer County is the breeding male of the North Park pack, who frequents far eastern Jackson County, which abuts Larimer County on the west.\n\nThe latest map also shows an expansion of wolf activity in western Boulder County, which abuts Grand County to the east.\n\nHere is a list of confirmed wolf depredations in Colorado and amount paid to the livestock producers\n\nThe list through April 23 includes 25 total depredations, including 19 cattle, three sheep and three working cattle dogs. Total compensation of those settled claims is $39,892.95.\n\nThe latest depredations were reported in Grand County on April 17-18 near where wildlife officials believe released wolves may have established a den.\n\nThe list is absent of two other previously confirmed depredations of cattle in Jackson County on April 13, 2024, and Dec. 13, 2023. The Coloradoan has asked Colorado Parks and Wildlife for clarification on those depredations.\n\nThere have been numerous wolf depredation claims by ranchers that were not confirmed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife.\n\nHere is a look at the confirmed depredations by year:\n\n's DENVER -- An updated map was published today on Colorado Parks and Wildlife's (CPW) website to continue informing the public, recreationists, and livestock producers on where collared wolves have been in the past month. CPW will update this map with new information monthly to reflect data for the past 30 days or so, produced on the fourth Wednesday of every month.\n\nCPW also launched a new Gray Wolf Depredation Report webpage to inform the public about confirmed livestock depredations by wolves in Colorado. This page will be updated each time CPW staff investigates and confirms a new depredation event.\n\nThis will be the last press release announcing Collared Gray Wolf Activity Map updates. The website will continue to be updated with recent activity on the fourth Wednesday of every month.

The state agency was backed by Gov. Jared Polis, who supported the wolf reintroduction program, which he stressed was approved by Colorado voters.\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife has been hit with an onslaught of letters from stockgrowers and other organizations from all over the Western Slope, requesting the state lethally take out two wolves that ranchers believe are responsible for some of the seven deaths of cattle and calves in Grand and Jackson counties in April.\n\nAn environmental group that supports the wolf restoration refers to the killing of livestock by wolves Wednesday as \"harvesting.\"\n\nAccording to a letter sent by Parks and Wildlife Director Jeff Davis - no help is coming.\n\nTuesday's letter from Davis has raised concerns in the ranching community. In the letter, Davis said the male of the pair of wolves believed to be attacking livestock is \"denning,\" as is a female, which means the animals are about to reproduce.\n\nDavis cited the pending births as a reason not to go after the wolves, stating that removing the male wolf \"would be irresponsible management\" and could potentially result in the deaths of the presumed pups.\n\n\"This is not a desirable result, and I am therefore not going to take action at this time to lethally remove this animal,\" Davis wrote.\n\nBased on previous information from the state wildlife agency, those pups will not be collared, meaning ranchers will have no idea where these pups are hunting once they're old enough to be on their own.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers responded to the letter, saying they are \"disappointed and discouraged in the director's response. Although we are not surprised by it, we are not done yet. We have to keep fighting for agriculture and fully expected CPW to follow ALL of the parts of the wolf plan.\"\n\nPolis also rejected calls to help the Grand and Jackson county ranchers.\n\n\"It is widely known that wolves are opportunistic hunters and Colorado voters were fully aware of the diet of wolves and made the decision to reintroduce wolves,\" Polis said through a spokesperson Tuesday. \"Now CPW and [the Colorado Department of Agriculture] will work with ranchers on how to successfully and non-lethally deter predation, as is being done successfully in many other states that have both vibrant and successful ranching sectors and a much larger population of wolves than Colorado.\"\n\nWildlife Reintroduced Colorado wolf dies in Larimer County, as more call on wildlife officials to adopt lethal management Marianne Goodland marianne.goodland@coloradopolitics.com\n\nWild Earth Guardians applauded Davis' decision Wednesday.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Six cattle have been harvested by wolves since Colorado began restoring the native keystone species to the state in December 2023. The owners of those livestock are eligible for \"100 percent fair market value compensation,\" according to the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, although to-date, no compensation claims have been submitted,\" the group's statement said.\n\nLindsay Larris, conservation director for WildEarth Guardians, said, \"Director Davis is right to allow these wolves to live. Killing them would not only decimate Colorado's wolf population but could lead to more livestock-wolf conflict down the line by disrupting pack structure. Colorado has eleven known wolves right now and some 2.8 million cows. We are sympathetic to the livestock owners' losses, but that's why there is a robust compensation program. We ought to be celebrating the fact that these wolves are denning and hopefully going to have pups. This is what Colorado voters wanted and what restoration looks like.\"\n\nThe compensation program, however, is inadequate, according to one of the letters this week from ag groups. The Colorado Wool Growers Association told Davis and the governor Tuesday that \"failure to manage wolves because of capitulation to political pressure continues to damage relationships with landowners and imperil livestock.\"\n\nCompensation for livestock is wholly inadequate to address the impacts of wolves on the landscape, according to many ag groups, the letter said. While their job as livestock owners is to protect their livestock, those tools have been stripped away. While the wool growers appreciate that there is a compensation program, it \"pales in comparison to the anger, fear, exhaustion, and the financial and emotional toll on ranchers that are trying to protect their livestock from these lethal predator attacks.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's letter to the Middle Park Stockgrowers, based in Grand County and representing ranchers who've lost livestock to wolves in recent weeks, Davis denied the wolves that killed the cattle come with a history of chronic depredation.\n\nSubscriber Content Grand County livestock growers urge Polis, wildlife officials to 'lethally' manage wolves following attacks Marianne Goodland marianne.goodland@coloradopolitics.com\n\nThat's despite Oregon's Fish and Wildlife Service reporting that wolves from a pack that later showed up in Colorado were involved in multiple incidents of killing or injuring livestock in 2023, as recently as last July.\n\nThe Oregon agency reported three separate incidents involving wolves from the Five Points Pack that resulted in injury and death of livestock. Two wolves from that pack were among the first five wolves brought to Colorado last December.\n\nDavis noted the letter from Middle Park claimed the wolves' attacking livestock in Grand County came from depredating packs. \"To continue to state that we brought known problem wolves into the state is a falsehood,\" Davis wrote. He said the wolves selected \"may have come from packs that were historically chronically depredating packs,\" but action taken by Oregon and in the months leading up to their relocation to Colorado shows they were not from recently depredating packs.\n\nThe state's wolf plan plainly states, \"No wolf that has a known history of chronic depredation should be translocated, and sourcing from geographic areas with chronic depredation events should not occur.\"\n\nA letter from the Associated Governments of Northwest Colorado Tuesday pointed out that Colorado Parks and Wildlife had promised such attacks on livestock would be \"incredibly rare.\"\n\nCPW released an updated wolf map Wednesday, which shows wolves have now crossed into the west Boulder County watershed.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

That's up from 216 wolves in 37 packs the previous year.\n\n\"Recovery is happening right before our eyes,\" said Ben Maletzke, statewide wolf specialist at the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nMaletzke presented the state's annual wolf report during a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Saturday. The results are likely an undercount because of the difficulty identifying every animal in the state, especially lone wolves without a pack.\n\nThe 2023 increase follows steady upward trends since the first Department of Fish and Wildlife survey in 2008. The gray wolf population has grown by an average of 23% every year since then, according to the agency.\n\nThe increase has led the agency to consider lowering gray wolves' protection status from \"endangered\" to \"sensitive\" under state law. Environmentalists say the move is premature.\n\nEven if the state makes the policy change, wolves would still be protected in the western two-thirds of Washington under the federal Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Commission is expected to decide on the reclassification in July.\n\nThe decision would be another step in the long-controversial management of wolves in Washington since the first breeding pack was confirmed in 2008. Environmentalists say the state is not doing enough to protect the endangered animals while ranchers say the state is not doing enough to protect their livestock, which wolves can injure or kill.\n\n\"The department says reducing wolf protections would show it's making progress towards recovery, but this report tells a different story,\" Amaroq Weiss, a senior wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.\n\nThe annual report shows a continued lack of wolves in western Washington and fewer breeding pairs than in previous years, she added. Last year, 25 of the state's wolf packs were considered successful breeding pairs, down one pair from 2022.\n\nWolf populations have steadily increased in eastern Washington and the northern Cascades. But Weiss said the state should not consider downlisting wolves until they've established territories in other parts of the state where they historically roamed, including from the southern Cascades to the northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula.\n\nMaletzke said there were signs of wolves gaining more of a foothold in western Washington last year. One known wolf spent significant time there, likely looking for a mate, and more wolves began to move south of Interstate 90.\n\n\"This likely means it is only a matter of time before new packs begin to establish in that recovery region,\" Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind said in a statement.\n\nThree dozen wolves died across the state in 2023, one fewer than last year, according to the report.\n\nMost of those deaths were from legal tribal hunting. Vehicles hit and killed five wolves, a cougar killed one. Another four were killed illegally, and those deaths are still under investigation.\n\nThe number of wolves killed following livestock conflicts - one of the most controversial pieces of wolf management - was also down in 2023. In 2022, nine wolves were killed by either the state or ranchers following a conflict with livestock.\n\nAccording to the 2023 report, only three wolves were killed because of livestock conflicts. Two were killed by the state, and one by a livestock owner.\n\nNine of the 42 known wolf packs, about 21%, were involved in at least one confirmed or probable conflict with livestock last year.\n\n\"The majority of the packs out there aren't involved in conflicts even though they overlap with livestock,\" Maletzke said. \"That's promising.\"\n\nBut, he added, that doesn't come without a cost.\n\nThe state estimates it spent more than $1.6 million last year on wolf management. More than $1.3 million of that went to research. The rest pays for lost livestock, lethal removal of wolves, and efforts to prevent wolf-livestock conflicts.\n\nThese efforts have kept the number of conflicts with livestock low compared to the population growth over time, Maletzke said.\n\nby Laurel Demkovich, Washington State Standard\n\nWashington State Standard is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Jared Polis and Colorado Department of Natural Resources and Colorado Parks and Wildlife leadership since sending a letter requesting they authorize the lethal removal of two wolves responsible for multiple recent cattle kills.\n\nThe association represents Grand and Summit counties, where 10 wolves were released by the state in late December as part of its voter-mandated reintroduction program.\n\nThe association said it didn't from the governor or state agencies after sending a letter Thursday, April 18, and it fired off another letter Monday, April 22, once again requesting the \"immediate lethal removal for two specific wolves\" in Grand County.\n\nThe letter further stated: \"We are deeply concerned by the lack of response to our initial request on April 18th, 2024. The urgency of this situation demands swift and decisive action.\"\n\nTim Ritschard, president of the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association, said he had been in contact with the governor's office and Colorado Department of Natural Resources and Colorado Parks and Wildlife regarding ranchers' concerns.\n\nBut since the latest incidents, \"I haven't heard boo from those people,\" he said. \"They don't want to listen to us. But we continue to build a group and we will keep the pressure on. We want to work with them, but it's going to get ugly, really ugly if we do have another depredation.\"\n\nThat group includes the North Park Stockgrowers Association, which represents Jackson County just to the north of Grand County. That association also sent the governor and state agencies a similar letter Monday. There have been two recent confirmed wolf depredations in Jackson County: on April 2, when a calf was killed, and on April 13, when a calf was injured.\n\nThe Larimer County Stockgrowers Association also joined in the letter-writing campaign Monday.\n\n\"From wolf selection to post-depredation management, CPW has repeatedly failed the affected producers, community stakeholders and the residents of Colorado by your inability and unwillingness to act in good faith regarding the entire reintroduction process,\" the letter read in part.\n\nThe Coloradoan reached out to Colorado Parks and Wildlife on Monday for a response. The agency said it would share its response letter after it is sent to the Middle Park Stockgrowers directly. The Coloradoan has also reached out to Polis' office.\n\nRob Edward, president of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, which spearheaded the campaign to pass the 2020 ballot initiative to reintroduce wolves by the end of 2023, said he feels bad for the ranchers who have faced depredations.\n\nHe added the key going forward is for ranchers to exhaust nonlethal strategies to deter the wolves.\n\n\"This (recent depredations) is not completely unexpected and it's not a signal the reintroduction process is going awry; the sky is not falling,\" he said. \"There have been successes with ranchers using nonlethal strategies to deter wolves in North Park. There is change happening and it requires more work, but this is change ranchers can manage and there are multiple mechanisms to help them prepare for wolves.\"\n\nWhat out-of-state wolf experts believe Colorado should do with depredating wolves\n\nDiane Boyd is a Montana-based wolf expert who compiled a report commissioned by the National Wildlife Federation examining 40 years of extensive wolf research from across the country. The report, \"Lessons Learned to Inform Colorado Wolf Reintroduction and Management,\" was done in part to help Colorado wildlife leaders plan and manage wolf reintroduction.\n\nShe said removal of chronic depredating wolves was part of the mid-1990s wolf reintroduction in the northern Rocky Mountains and Colorado should follow a similar plan, which will help build long-term recovery success.\n\n\"Removing wolves is part of the process,\" she said. \"If Colorado doesn't understand that, it will be a continuing challenge. And they don't want a Don Gittleson situation on a statewide basis where these ranchers are stuck with no choices. This new situation (released wolves) offers choices.\"\n\nGittleson has had seven cows confirmed killed in the last two years on his leased ranch north of Walden, according to previous Coloradoan reporting. In December, his request for the state to lethally remove the remaining two North Park pack members due to chronic depredation was denied. The North Park pack was here before the state's reintroduction began.\n\nCarter Niemeyer spent three decades killing wolves for the federal government but most recently has helped ranchers with nonlethal means of dealing with depredating wolves. He is retired in Idaho and served on Colorado Parks and Wildlife's Technical Working Group that helped create the state's wolf recovery plan.\n\nHe also believes lethal removal should be an option on wolves that continue to depredate, but only after sincere efforts have been made by ranchers to deter wolves with through nonlethal measures.\n\nThe state's wolf recovery plan encourages Colorado ranchers to first use nonlethal strategies to deter wolves but does not require those methods before legally killing a wolf under the federal 10(j) rule.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers Association letter said Grand County ranchers have been implementing various nonlethal deterrents.\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife makes nonlethal tools available to ranchers.\n\n\"There are not a lot of happy endings when wolves begin chronically killing livestock,\" Neimeyer said. \"That's why they will have to define chronic pretty darn quickly. But to think this wouldn't happen you would have to be pretty na\u00efve. You need to start with nonlethal means to dissuade wolves from starting or continuing to kill livestock.\n\n\"Inevitably, there will be some dead livestock and there will be wolf removals. How you get to there is a hard decision.\"\n\nHe said so many recent wolf depredations in one area of Grand County might mean the wolves have started to den. State wildlife officials said several weeks ago they are unsure if the released wolves will produce a litter this year.\n\n\"The toughest decision with all of this is what if you have pups in a den right near where those recent depredations took place,\" he said.\n\nState wildlife agency unwilling to identify by tracking collars what wolves involved in kills\n\nThe Coloradoan has repeatedly asked Colorado Parks and Wildlife to identify by collar the wolves involved in all livestock depredations.\n\nThe agency has confirmed released wolves were involved in all livestock incidents in April in Grand County. But it has refused to provide the tracking collars, saying doing so would result in a safety concern to the animals.\n\n\"We're not revealing further information because CPW is concerned that if the potentially depredating wolf/wolves is identified this will increase the risk of harm or harassment of the animals,\" the state wildlife agency said in an email.\n\nThe Coloradoan's request is to determine if wolves captured in Oregon were involved in recent depredations in that state and similarly involved in depredations in Colorado. That information could confirm or refute a pattern of chronic depredation by those wolves.\n\nThe Coloradoan identified five of the 10 wolves released into Colorado belonged to Oregon packs that had confirmed livestock depredations between July 2023 and being captured in December 2023, according to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife wolf depredation reports.\n\nPrior to the reintroduction, Colorado Parks and Wildlife leadership had publicly said it wouldn't release reintroduced wolves that have depredated livestock, and a state wolf recovery plan that says: \"No wolf should be translocated that has a known history of chronic depredation, and sourcing from geographic areas with chronic depredation events should not occur.\"\n\nIt is largely agreed by wolf experts and affirmed by studies that once wolves learn to kill livestock, they have a propensity to continue the behavior.\n\n\"I was quite shocked to hear they brought in depredating wolves,'' Niemeyer said. \"Those aren't the ones you want to build a reintroduction program on. It's bad optics from public perception.''\n\nWolves learning to kill livestock can lead to chronic depredation, which Colorado's wolf recovery plan does not define.\n\nThat lack of definition makes it difficult to lethally remove chronic depredating wolves, which is allowed under Colorado's federal 10(j) rule.\n\nRanchers and state legislators representing livestock producers have pressured the governor and Colorado Parks and Wildlife to define chronic depredation so a decision can be made on the option of lethal removal.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers Association's Monday letter said the state of Washington's definition of chronic depredation includes three depredations in 30 days or four depredations in a 10-month rolling window and should serve as a benchmark for Colorado.\n\nThe association argues the recent depredations exceed that definition with two wolves killing five cattle in three separate incidents over 16 days.\n\nAs of Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed that wolves in the state have accounted for 27 injuries or death to livestock and the animals that herd and guard them.\n\nDepredations have injured or killed 21 cattle, three sheep and three working cattle dogs. All but five cattle involved the North Park pack. Those were the most recent Grand County depredations by the released wolves.\n\nThe state has paid out just less than $40,000 since December 2021 in compensation to ranchers for losses to wolves. That does not take into account the livestock losses this month.\n\nWhere is Colorado getting wolves from for future releases?\n\nThe Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in Washington will provide Colorado with up to 15 wolves for the reintroduction program between December 2024 and March 2025,", "source": {"uri": "coloradoan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Coloradoan"},

The state agency was backed by Gov. Jared Polis, who supported the wolf reintroduction program, which he stressed was approved by Colorado voters.\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife has been hit with an onslaught of letters from stockgrowers and other organizations from all over the Western Slope, requesting the state lethally take out two wolves that ranchers believe are responsible for some of the seven deaths of cattle and calves in Grand and Jackson counties in April.\n\nAn environmental group that supports the wolf restoration refers to the killing of livestock by wolves Wednesday as \"harvesting.\"\n\nAccording to a letter sent by Parks and Wildlife Director Jeff Davis - no help is coming.\n\nTuesday's letter from Davis has raised concerns in the ranching community. In the letter, Davis said the male of the pair of wolves believed to be attacking livestock is \"denning,\" as is a female, which means the animals are about to reproduce.\n\nDavis cited the pending births as a reason not to go after the wolves, stating that removing the male wolf \"would be irresponsible management\" and could potentially result in the deaths of the presumed pups.\n\n\"This is not a desirable result, and I am therefore not going to take action at this time to lethally remove this animal,\" Davis wrote.\n\nBased on previous information from the state wildlife agency, those pups will not be collared, meaning ranchers will have no idea where these pups are hunting once they're old enough to be on their own.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers responded to the letter, saying they are \"disappointed and discouraged in the director's response. Although we are not surprised by it, we are not done yet. We have to keep fighting for agriculture and fully expected CPW to follow ALL of the parts of the wolf plan.\"\n\nPolis also rejected calls to help the Grand and Jackson county ranchers.\n\n\"It is widely known that wolves are opportunistic hunters and Colorado voters were fully aware of the diet of wolves and made the decision to reintroduce wolves,\" Polis said through a spokesperson Tuesday. \"Now CPW and [the Colorado Department of Agriculture] will work with ranchers on how to successfully and non-lethally deter predation, as is being done successfully in many other states that have both vibrant and successful ranching sectors and a much larger population of wolves than Colorado.\"\n\nWildlife Reintroduced Colorado wolf dies in Larimer County, as more call on wildlife officials to adopt lethal management Marianne Goodland marianne.goodland@coloradopolitics.com\n\nWild Earth Guardians applauded Davis' decision Wednesday.\n\nSign up for free: News Alerts Stay in the know on the stories that affect you the most.\n\nSign Up For Free View all of our newsletters.

The owners of those livestock are eligible for \"100 percent fair market value compensation,\" according to the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, although to-date, no compensation claims have been submitted,\" the group's statement said.\n\nLindsay Larris, conservation director for WildEarth Guardians, said, \"Director Davis is right to allow these wolves to live. Killing them would not only decimate Colorado's wolf population but could lead to more livestock-wolf conflict down the line by disrupting pack structure. Colorado has eleven known wolves right now and some 2.8 million cows. We are sympathetic to the livestock owners' losses, but that's why there is a robust compensation program. We ought to be celebrating the fact that these wolves are denning and hopefully going to have pups. This is what Colorado voters wanted and what restoration looks like.\"\n\nThe compensation program, however, is inadequate, according to one of the letters this week from ag groups. The Colorado Wool Growers Association told Davis and the governor Tuesday that \"failure to manage wolves because of capitulation to political pressure continues to damage relationships with landowners and imperil livestock.\"\n\nCompensation for livestock is wholly inadequate to address the impacts of wolves on the landscape, according to many ag groups, the letter said. While their job as livestock owners is to protect their livestock, those tools have been stripped away. While the wool growers appreciate that there is a compensation program, it \"pales in comparison to the anger, fear, exhaustion, and the financial and emotional toll on ranchers that are trying to protect their livestock from these lethal predator attacks.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's letter to the Middle Park Stockgrowers, based in Grand County and representing ranchers who've lost livestock to wolves in recent weeks, Davis denied the wolves that killed the cattle come with a history of chronic depredation.\n\nSubscriber Content Grand County livestock growers urge Polis, wildlife officials to 'lethally' manage wolves following attacks Marianne Goodland marianne.goodland@coloradopolitics.com\n\nThat's despite Oregon's Fish and Wildlife Service reporting that wolves from a pack that later showed up in Colorado were involved in multiple incidents of killing or injuring livestock in 2023, as recently as last July.\n\nThe Oregon agency reported three separate incidents involving wolves from the Five Points Pack that resulted in injury and death of livestock. Two wolves from that pack were among the first five wolves brought to Colorado last December.\n\nDavis noted the letter from Middle Park claimed the wolves' attacking livestock in Grand County came from depredating packs. \"To continue to state that we brought known problem wolves into the state is a falsehood,\" Davis wrote. He said the wolves selected \"may have come from packs that were historically chronically depredating packs,\" but action taken by Oregon and in the months leading up to their relocation to Colorado shows they were not from recently depredating packs.\n\nThe state's wolf plan plainly states, \"No wolf that has a known history of chronic depredation should be translocated, and sourcing from geographic areas with chronic depredation events should not occur.\"\n\nA letter from the Associated Governments of Northwest Colorado Tuesday pointed out that Colorado Parks and Wildlife had promised such attacks on livestock would be \"incredibly rare.\"\n\nCPW released an updated wolf map Wednesday, which shows wolves have now crossed into the west Boulder County watershed.", "source": {"uri":

Great Lakes wolves are genetically distinct from the Northern Rockies wolves that were reintroduced.\n\nOne of the 10 reintroduced wolves was also found dead on April 18 in Larimer County, about 170 miles north of where the gray wolf was trapped in Elbert County, officials said. Initial evidence suggests the wolf may have died of natural causes.\n\nBecause wolves are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act, the federal agency is investigating both incidents. Experts don't yet know whether the trapped gray wolf traveled to Colorado on its own or was brought there in some other way.\n\nWolves do sometimes leave the pack they were born into -- known as their natal pack -- and venture off on their own to find or make a new pack, officials said.\n\nThe distance these wolves travel varies.

Initial evidence suggests that this wolf likely died of natural causes, but a final determination will not be made until the necropsy is completed,\" he said.\n\n\"This wolf was one of the ten recently released by Colorado Parks and Wildlife in December 2023, and the Service is working cooperatively with CPW in our investigation. No additional details are available at this time.\"\n\nSome of the wolves released in Colorado in December came from packs from Oregon with a history of killing livestock, including kills as recent as a year ago.\n\nSeveral wolves are responsible for recent attacks on cattle in Grand and Jackson counties. At least six cattle, including two calves, were killed in a two-week period, and another calf was injured. Most of the kills were from wolves reintroduced in the state in December, although the livestock killed in Jackson County may have been from wolves that have been in that area for several years.\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife has been under fire for refusing to do anything other than recommend non-lethal methods, which ranchers say have limited effectiveness, if at all.\n\nThe pleas to state wildlife officials to take action started with a letter last week from the Middle Park Stockgrowers, a Grand County organization, which called on the agency to use lethal methods to deal with the wolves that are killing livestock during the heart of calving season.\n\nOne letter has now turned into a flood of letters to the agency -- from the North Park Stockgrowers, the Grand County sheriff, the Gunnison County Stockgrowers' Association, the Larimer County Stockgrowers and the Associated Governments of Northern Colorado.\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife's lack of action is causing ranchers to \"close the gates\" to members of the public who rely on private lands for hunting, fishing and recreational pursuits, as well as off wildlife staff from conservation programs, including wildlife programs, that rely on private landowners, the livestock groups said.\n\nThe Gunnison County ranchers said the situation is clearly \"chronic depredation,\" which \"warrants management of these problem wolves.\"\n\n\"How CPW leadership moves forward and takes care of this conflict is critical to the success of wolf reintroduction in Colorado,\" the group said.\n\nThe Associated Governments of Northern Colorado represents Delta, Garfield, Grand, Mesa, Moffat, Montrose, and Rio Blanco counties and all their municipalities.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTheir letter, which supported the Middle Park Stockgrowers, blasted the state wildlife agency for missteps in the reintroduction process and the problems that have taken place since.\n\nThe killing of 20 animals, including cattle, sheep and working dogs in Jackson County by wolves that originated in Wyoming, is \"intolerable,\" the group said, adding it has cost taxpayers $39,000.\n\nThe state's wolf management plan said \"no wolf should be translocated that has a known history of chronic depredation, and sourcing from geographic areas with chronic depredation events should not occur.\"\n\nThe group pointed out that Colorado Parks and Wildlife had promised such attacks on livestock would be \"incredibly rare.\"\n\n\"It is evident that CPW's approach so far has been grossly inadequate,\" the group said.\" The agency's refusal to share live tracking data would help ranchers with preparing for mitigating those situations.\n\nThe letter also noted Colorado Parks and Wildlife's failure to come up with a definition of \"chronic depredation\" that would allow the agency and ranchers the authority to deal with wolves that are chronically killing livestock.\n\n\"CPW is using the lack of definition as a shield to refuse lethal take of these killer wolves,\" the group said, pointing out that other states have been decisive in similar situations, such as Montana, which removed an entire pack after one wolf killed just one animal.\n\nThe letter also raised concerns over ranchers' mental health.\n\n\"These ranches are oftentimes generational and deeply ingrained in the producers' DNA. This isn't just a job to them, this is their livelihood and their way of life,\" the group said. \"They've been lied to and denied their basic rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The trust is gone. The gates are closing.\"\n\nThe group added: \"CPW themselves have admitted that the wildlife program would not exist without the cooperation of these families. We are extremely disappointed in how CPW has shown its gratitude to these same families.\"\n\nThe communities' patience is gone, the group also said.\n\nThe group demanded that wildlife officials \"start respecting the needs and rights of Northwest Colorado's residents.\"\n\n\"This begins with the removal of the wolves that are killing livestock in Grand and Jackson counties. Help the ranchers by sharing the tracking data and allow them to protect their animals. Lastly, allow genuine local stakeholder engagement,\" the group said, adding, \"Those coming to see the wolves will go home, but this is where we live.

That list includes depredations dates, the county they occurred in and how much the livestock producer was compensated or if a claim involving a confirmed kill has not been submitted.\n\nThe latest map shows wolf activity March 26 through April 23 expanding eastward in watersheds encompassing roughly the western three-fourths of Larimer County. That includes just east of U.S. Highway 287 north of Fort Collins and south to U.S. Highway 34 west of Loveland.\n\nThe map is created using tracking collars on the 12 known wolves in Colorado, including 10 released wolves in December and two from the remaining North Park pack.\n\nTwo collars on the released wolves are no longer providing signals to biologists, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said.\n\nThe wolves with the failed collars are traveling with other animals with functional collars, which currently allows state wildlife biologists to monitor those animals, the wildlife agency said in a news release. The agency has confirmed the animals with the malfunctioning collars are still alive based on visual confirmation from an airplane.\n\nThe map is broken down by watersheds, which can be large. If a wolf collar indicates it was or is in that watershed, the entire watershed is marked as having wolves in it at some point in the last month. It does not necessarily mean a wolf or wolves are currently in those areas.\n\nOne of the 10 wolves captured in Oregon and released in Grand and Summit counties was found deceased in Larimer County on April 18 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was made aware of the death.\n\nIt was the first death of the 10 released wolves.\n\nThe expansion of wolf activity could be related to the movement of the deceased wolf. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not identified the exact location of the deceased wolf.\n\nThe federal agency and Colorado Parks and Wildlife are investigating the cause of the wolf's death, which preliminarily is labeled as natural causes.\n\nThe only other known collared wolf near Larimer County is the breeding male of the North Park pack, who frequents far eastern Jackson County, which abuts Larimer County on the west.\n\nThe latest map also shows an expansion of wolf activity in western Boulder County, which abuts Grand County to the east.\n\nThe list through April 23 includes 25 total depredations, including 19 cattle, three sheep and three working cattle dogs. Total compensation of those settled claims is $39,892.95.\n\nThe latest depredations were reported in Grand County on April 17-18 near where wildlife officials believe released wolves may have established a den.\n\nThe list is absent of two other previously confirmed depredations of cattle in Jackson County on April 13, 2024, and Dec. 13, 2023. The Coloradoan has asked Colorado Parks and Wildlife for clarification on those depredations.\n\nThere have been numerous wolf depredation claims by ranchers that were not confirmed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife.\n\nHere is a look at the confirmed depredations by year:\n\n's DENVER -- An updated map was published today on Colorado Parks and Wildlife's (CPW) website to continue informing the public, recreationists, and livestock producers on where collared wolves have been in the past month. CPW will update this map with new information monthly to reflect data for the past 30 days or so, produced on the fourth Wednesday of every month.\n\nCPW also launched a new Gray Wolf Depredation Report webpage to inform the public about confirmed livestock depredations by wolves in Colorado. This page will be updated each time CPW staff investigates and confirms a new depredation event.\n\nThis will be the last press release announcing Collared Gray Wolf Activity Map updates. The website will continue to be updated with recent activity on the fourth Wednesday of every month.

That prompted the stockgrowers association to write letters to Davis, the governor and others requesting removal of the wolves.\n\nIn his response letter, Davis said the wolf that could be responsible for the depredations is the male of a pair believed to be denning. The female's collar indicates she is likely in a den, he wrote.\n\n\"In April, GPS points stopped uploading and very recently those points began to upload again,\" he wrote. \"Thepoints for this female's collar are showing a very localized position. The biological interpretation of this is that she was likely in a den during the time when connectivity with the collar was interrupted, which aligns with the expected timing of wolf reproduction.\"\n\nIf confirmed, it would mark the first den from the wolves reintroduced into Colorado in late December.\n\nIt also would mark the first time wolves have been known to den in Colorado since the parents of the North Park pack naturally migrated to Colorado and gave birth to six pups in the spring of 2021.\n\n\"We all figured up here there was a den,\" said Tim Ritschard, president of the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association. \"CPW has been telling us the collars aren't working and our guess was the female was denned up.\"\n\nThose 10 wolves from eastern Oregon were released in late December into Grand County, where Kremmling is located, and Summit County and include two adult males from different packs, two now 2-year-old males from different packs and six now 2-year-old females from various packs. Wolves are considered to be of breeding age at ages 2 to 3.\n\nRetired wolf expert Carter Niemeyer told the Coloradoan in a story that published online April 22 that so many recent wolf depredations in one area of Grand County might mean the wolves have started to den in the area.\n\n\"The toughest decision with all of this is what if you have pups in a den right near where those recent depredations took place,\" he said in the story.\n\nRanchers have been riled up over the discovery previously reported by the Coloradoan that identified five of the 10 wolves released into Colorado belonged to Oregon packs that had confirmed livestock depredations between July 2023 and when they were captured in December 2023, according to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife wolf depredation reports.\n\nMost wolf experts agree depredating livestock is a behavior learned from wolf parents.\n\nIn his letter, David said the removal of wolves will be considered once wolves become reestablished.\n\n\"The wolf population in Colorado is far below any restoration goal,\" Davis wrote. \"We have the legal duty toestablish a self-sustaining population of wolves while minimizing conflict risk. Any consideration of lethal removal will be carefully deliberated to ensure it does not conflict with these legally mandated restoration goals. As the wolf population in Colorado grows, and as we get to points where we enter different management phases, the approach to lethal removals will likely become more liberal.\"\n\nHe also said he recognizes the stress the depredations have caused ranchers but hopes the two sides can work together to minimize losses.\n\n\"It's not lost on me that these very tense times are putting a great deal of strain on our relationships,\" he wrote. \"We hope that no matter what, we can continue to work together to successfully avoid and minimize impacts on the agricultural industry while restoring wolves to Colorado.\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradoan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Coloradoan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fort_collins_coloradoan@coloradoan.com", "name": "Fort Collins Coloradoan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Parks and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Park_(Colorado_basin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle Park (Colorado basin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremmling,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kremmling, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kremmling, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Park_(Colorado_basin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Park (Colorado basin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Department_of_Fish_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/12/19/PFTC/71966459007-wolves.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1199,675,x0,y138&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503908", "eventUri": "eng-9503908", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 413, "textEnd": 421}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 2695, "textEnd": 2703}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Jared Polis and Colorado Department of Natural Resources and Colorado Parks and Wildlife leadership since sending a letter requesting they authorize the lethal removal of two wolves responsible for multiple recent cattle kills.\n\nThe association represents Grand and Summit counties, where 10 wolves were released by the state in late December as part of its voter-mandated reintroduction program.\n\nThe association said it didn't hear from the governor or state agencies after sending a letter Thursday, April 18, and it fired off another letter Monday, April 22, once again requesting the \"immediate lethal removal for two specific wolves\" in Grand County.\n\nThe letter further stated: \"We are deeply concerned by the lack of response to our initial request on April 18th, 2024. The urgency of this situation demands swift and decisive action.\"\n\nTim Ritschard, president of the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association, said he had been in contact with the governor's office and Colorado Department of Natural Resources and Colorado Parks and Wildlife regarding ranchers' concerns.\n\nBut since the latest incidents, \"I haven't heard boo from those people,\" he said. \"They don't want to listen to us. But we continue to build a group and we will keep the pressure on. We want to work with them, but it's going to get ugly, really ugly if we do have another depredation.\"\n\nThat group includes the North Park Stockgrowers Association, which represents Jackson County just to the north of Grand County. That association also sent the governor and state agencies a similar letter Monday. There have been two recent confirmed wolf depredations in Jackson County: on April 2, when a calf was killed, and on April 13, when a calf was injured.\n\nThe Larimer County Stockgrowers Association also joined in the letter-writing campaign Monday.\n\n\"From wolf selection to post-depredation management, CPW has repeatedly failed the affected producers, community stakeholders and the residents of Colorado by your inability and unwillingness to act in good faith regarding the entire reintroduction process,\" the letter read in part.\n\nThe Coloradoan reached out to Colorado Parks and Wildlife on Monday for a response. The agency said it would share its response letter after it is sent to the Middle Park Stockgrowers directly. The Coloradoan has also reached out to Polis' office.\n\nRob Edward, president of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, which spearheaded the campaign to pass the 2020 ballot initiative to reintroduce wolves by the end of 2023, said he feels bad for the ranchers who have faced depredations.\n\nHe added the key going forward is for ranchers to exhaust nonlethal strategies to deter the wolves.\n\n\"This (recent depredations) is not completely unexpected and it's not a signal the reintroduction process is going awry; the sky is not falling,\" he said. \"There have been successes with ranchers using nonlethal strategies to deter wolves in North Park. There is change happening and it requires more work, but this is change ranchers can manage and there are multiple mechanisms to help them prepare for wolves.\"\n\nDiane Boyd is a Montana-based wolf expert who compiled a report commissioned by the National Wildlife Federation examining 40 years of extensive wolf research from across the country. The report, \"Lessons Learned to Inform Colorado Wolf Reintroduction and Management,\" was done in part to help Colorado wildlife leaders plan and manage wolf reintroduction.\n\nShe said removal of chronic depredating wolves was part of the mid-1990s wolf reintroduction in the northern Rocky Mountains and Colorado should follow a similar plan, which will help build long-term recovery success.\n\n\"Removing wolves is part of the process,\" she said. \"If Colorado doesn't understand that, it will be a continuing challenge. And they don't want a Don Gittleson situation on a statewide basis where these ranchers are stuck with no choices. This new situation (released wolves) offers choices.\"\n\nGittleson has had seven cows confirmed killed in the last two years on his leased ranch north of Walden, according to previous Coloradoan reporting. In December, his request for the state to lethally remove the remaining two North Park pack members due to chronic depredation was denied. The North Park pack was here before the state's reintroduction began.\n\nCarter Niemeyer spent three decades killing wolves for the federal government but most recently has helped ranchers with nonlethal means of dealing with depredating wolves. He is retired in Idaho and served on Colorado Parks and Wildlife's Technical Working Group that helped create the state's wolf recovery plan.\n\nHe also believes lethal removal should be an option on wolves that continue to depredate, but only after sincere efforts have been made by ranchers to deter wolves with nonlethal measures.\n\nThe state's wolf recovery plan encourages Colorado ranchers to first use nonlethal strategies to deter wolves but does not require those methods before legally killing a wolf under the federal 10(j) rule.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers Association letter said Grand County ranchers have been implementing various nonlethal deterrents.\n\nColorado Parks and Wildlife makes nonlethal tools available to ranchers.\n\n\"There are not a lot of happy endings when wolves begin chronically killing livestock,\" Niemeyer said. \"That's why they will have to define chronic pretty darn quickly. But to think this wouldn't happen you would have to be pretty na\u00efve. You need to start with nonlethal means to dissuade wolves from starting or continuing to kill livestock.\n\n\"Inevitably, there will be some dead livestock and there will be wolf removals. How you get there is a hard decision.\"\n\nHe said so many recent wolf depredations in one area of Grand County might mean the wolves have started to den in the area. State wildlife officials said several weeks ago they are unsure if the released wolves will produce a litter this year.\n\n\"The toughest decision with all of this is what if you have pups in a den right near where those recent depredations took place,\" he said.\n\nThe Coloradoan has repeatedly asked Colorado Parks and Wildlife to identify by collar the wolves involved in all livestock depredations.\n\nThe agency has confirmed released wolves were involved in all livestock incidents in April in Grand County. But it has refused to provide the tracking collars, saying doing so would result in a safety concern to the animals.\n\n\"We're not revealing further information because CPW is concerned that if the potentially depredating wolf/wolves is identified this will increase the risk of harm or harassment of the animals,\" the state wildlife agency said in an email.\n\nThe Coloradoan's request is to determine if wolves captured in Oregon were involved in recent depredations in that state and similarly involved in depredations in Colorado. That information could confirm or refute a pattern of chronic depredation by those wolves.\n\nThe Coloradoan identified five of the 10 wolves released into Colorado belonged to Oregon packs that had confirmed livestock depredations between July 2023 and being captured in December 2023, according to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife wolf depredation reports.\n\nPrior to the reintroduction, Colorado Parks and Wildlife leadership had publicly said it wouldn't release reintroduced wolves that have depredated livestock.\n\nIn addition, a state wolf recovery plan says: \"No wolf should be translocated that has a known history of chronic depredation, and sourcing from geographic areas with chronic depredation events should not occur.\"\n\nIt is largely agreed by wolf experts and affirmed by studies that once wolves learn to kill livestock, they have a propensity to continue the behavior.\n\n\"I was quite shocked to hear they brought in depredating wolves,'' Niemeyer said. \"Those aren't the ones you want to build a reintroduction program on. It's bad optics from public perception.''\n\nWolves learning to kill livestock can lead to chronic depredation, which Colorado's wolf recovery plan does not define.\n\nThat lack of definition makes it difficult to lethally remove chronic depredating wolves, which is allowed under Colorado's federal 10(j) rule.\n\nRanchers and state legislators representing livestock producers have pressured the governor and Colorado Parks and Wildlife to define chronic depredation so a decision can be made on the option of lethal removal.\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers Association's Monday letter said the state of Washington's definition of chronic depredation includes three depredations in 30 days or four depredations in a 10-month rolling window and should serve as a benchmark for Colorado.\n\nThe association argues the recent depredations exceed that definition with two wolves killing five cattle in three separate incidents over 16 days.\n\nAs of Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed that wolves in the state have accounted for 27 injuries or death to livestock and the animals that herd and guard them.\n\nDepredations have injured or killed 21 cattle, three sheep and three working cattle dogs. All but five cattle involved the North Park pack. Those were the most recent Grand County depredations by the released wolves.\n\nThe state has paid out just less than $40,000 since December 2021 in compensation to ranchers for losses to wolves. That does not take into account the livestock losses this month.\n\nThe Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in Washington will provide Colorado with up to 15 wolves for the reintroduction program between December 2024 and March 2025,", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type":

That prompted the stockgrowers association to write letters to Davis, the governor and others requesting removal of the wolves.\n\nIn his response letter, Davis said the wolf that could be responsible for the depredations is the male of a pair believed to be denning. The female's collar indicates she is likely in a den, he wrote.\n\n\"In April, GPS points stopped uploading and very recently those points began to upload again,\" he wrote. \"Thepoints for this female's collar are showing a very localized position. The biological interpretation of this is that she was likely in a den during the time when connectivity with the collar was interrupted, which aligns with the expected timing of wolf reproduction.\"\n\nIf confirmed, it would mark the first den from the wolves reintroduced into Colorado in late December.\n\nIt also would mark the first time wolves have been known to den in Colorado since the parents of the North Park pack naturally migrated to Colorado and gave birth to six pups in the spring of 2021.\n\n\"We all figured up here there was a den,\" said Tim Ritschard, president of the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association. \"CPW has been telling us the collars aren't working and our guess was the female was denned up.\"\n\nThose 10 wolves from eastern Oregon were released in late December into Grand County, where Kremmling is located, and Summit County and include two adult males from different packs, two now 2-year-old males from different packs and six now 2-year-old females from various packs. Wolves are considered to be of breeding age at ages 2 to 3.\n\nRetired wolf expert Carter Niemeyer told the Coloradoan in a story that published online April 22 that so many recent wolf depredations in one area of Grand County might mean the wolves have started to den in the area.\n\n\"The toughest decision with all of this is what if you have pups in a den right near where those recent depredations took place,\" he said in the story.\n\nRanchers have been riled up over the discovery previously reported by the Coloradoan that identified five of the 10 wolves released into Colorado belonged to Oregon packs that had confirmed livestock depredations between July 2023 and when they were captured in December 2023, according to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife wolf depredation reports.\n\nMost wolf experts agree depredating livestock is a behavior learned from wolf parents.\n\nIn his letter, David said the removal of wolves will be considered once wolves become reestablished.\n\n\"The wolf population in Colorado is far below any restoration goal,\" Davis wrote. \"We have the legal duty toestablish a self-sustaining population of wolves while minimizing conflict risk. Any consideration of lethal removal will be carefully deliberated to ensure it does not conflict with these legally mandated restoration goals. As the wolf population in Colorado grows, and as we get to points where we enter different management phases, the approach to lethal removals will likely become more liberal.\"\n\nHe also said he recognizes the stress the depredations have caused ranchers but hopes the two sides can work together to minimize losses.\n\n\"It's not lost on me that these very tense times are putting a great deal of strain on our relationships,\" he wrote. \"We hope that no matter what, we can continue to work together to successfully avoid and minimize impacts on the agricultural industry while restoring wolves to Colorado.\"\n\nDavis' letter came the same day the first report of a released wolf's death was confirmed in Larimer County.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Park_(Colorado_basin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle Park (Colorado basin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremmling,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kremmling, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kremmling, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Parks and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Park_(Colorado_basin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Park (Colorado basin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Department_of_Fish_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larimer_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larimer County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larimer County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503908", "eventUri": "eng-9503908", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 235}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 2509, "textEnd": 2517}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The map shows that over the past month, at least one wolf with a GPS collar traveled in watersheds in Larimer and Boulder counties.\n\nTen gray wolves were released in Grand and Summit counties in mid-December in accordance with a voter-approved reintroduction program. Those were in addition to two wolves that dispersed into Jackson County on their own and produced six pups in 2021. In February 2023, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) officials placed collars on two of those wolves in North Park.\n\nOn April 18, authorities confirmed that one of the reintroduced wolves was found dead in Larimer County. The wolf appeared to die from natural causes, though a necropsy will determine the cause of death.\n\n> The video above aired Tuesday: Wolf released as part of reintroduction found dead in Larimer County\n\nRELATED: Wolf released as part of Colorado reintroduction found dead\n\nTwo of the 10 collars placed on reintroduced wolves have failed. CPW said the animals with failed collars are traveling with wolves that have functioning collars. Wildlife officials also confirmed the wolves with the failed collars are alive after seeing them from an airplane, CPW said.\n\nThe CPW activity map shows wolf activity in watersheds. Just because an area shows wolf activity doesn't mean that wolves are present through the entire watershed or are currently there, CPW said.\n\nCPW said the collars record a position every four hours. After four locations are recorded, that data is transmitted via satellite to biologists. CPW staff can use the data to see where wolves have been but not where they are at any current point in time, the agency said.\n\nThe map will be updated on the fourth Wednesday of every month, CPW said.\n\nCPW also said on Wednesday that it has launched a website for wolf depredation reports to keep the public informed about confirmed livestock deaths by wolves.\n\nWolves have killed six cattle in Grand and Jackson counties this month. Several stockgrowers associations asked CPW to lethally remove the wolves responsible for the livestock deaths.\n\nRELATED: Stockgrowers urge Colorado to remove wolves that killed cattle\n\nCPW responded in a letter on Tuesday that the wolf possibly responsible for the depredations is the male of a pair that are \"denning\" and that the female's GPS collar indicates she is likely in a den. The letter says that removing the \"male breeder\" would be irresponsible management and possibly cause the den to fail.\n\n\"The biological interpretation of this is that she was likely in a den during the time when connectivity with the collar was interrupted, which aligns with the expected timing of wolf reproduction,\" the letter says. \"This would be the first den from wolves reintroduced to Colorado. We are working diligently to confirm the den, and hope to have information on this soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Parks and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drainage basin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larimer_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larimer County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larimer County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Park_(Colorado_basin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Park (Colorado basin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Continental Divide of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Front Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/d528c5bf-aabb-49c2-bbe8-68fcedf321e6/20240424T181052/d528c5bf-aabb-49c2-bbe8-68fcedf321e6_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503908", "eventUri": "eng-9503908", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-26", "dateEnd": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 235, "textEnd": 256}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 761, "textEnd": 769}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The association had written to the state decrying the recent livestock losses reported in Grand and Jackson counties and requesting that the state lethally remove two depredating wolves.\n\nDepredations occur when a wolf takes a livestock producer's animal for food, essentially stealing from the business. According to Davis, these depredations may have been to support a wolf den. Wolfs begin \"denning,\" or establishing a home to birth and raise their pups, in the spring.\n\nAccording to the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, female wolves will birth their pups and remain in the den with the blind, helpless young to nurse and care for them. After about six weeks, the pups will begin to emerge with the female wolf. Between eight to 12 weeks, the pups will leave the den behind entirely.\n\nCPW is tracking the reintroduced wolves through GPS collars that send periodic data packages to the biologists, which showed signs of possible denning.\n\n\"In early April, GPS points stopped uploading and very recently those points began to upload again. The points for this female's collar are showing a very localized position,\" Davis wrote to the Middle Park Stockgrowers. \"The biological interpretation of this is that she was likely in a den during the time when connectivity with the collar was interrupted, which aligns with the expected timing of wolf reproduction.\"\n\nDavis said that if this is a den, it would be the first for the reintroduced wolves.\n\n\"We are working diligently to confirm the den, and hope to have information on this soon,\" he wrote.\n\nBecause of this, CPW biologists believe the wolf responsible for repeated depredations is the male of the denning pair.\n\n\"Removing the male breeder at this point would be irresponsible management and potentially cause the den to fail, possibly resulting in the death of the presumed pups,\" Davis wrote. \"This is not a desirable result and I am therefore not going to take action at this time to lethally remove this animal.\"\n\nRanchers are legally barred from lethally deterring wolves unless CPW permits a rancher to kill a wolf following a confirmed depredation.\n\nDavis also said that under the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, CPW is tasked with weighing the trade-offs of competing factors, like depredations and reproduction.\n\n\"The wolf population in Colorado is far below any restoration goal,\" Davis wrote. \"We have the legal duty to establish a self-sustaining population of wolves while minimizing conflict risk ... As the wolf population in Colorado grows, and as we get to points where we enter different management phases, the approach to lethal removals will likely become more liberal.\"\n\nTwo wolf carcasses were also found this month in Colorado, including one of the reintroduced wolves. The Fish and Wildlife Service said it will complete a necropsy on the wolves and determine if they died of natural causes. The agency also said initial evidence points to the reintroduced wolf dying of natural causes.", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heather_willard@kdvr.com", "name": "Heather Willard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_pair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breeding pair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Parks and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KDVR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Davis_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Davis County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeff Davis County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Fish and Wildlife Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location_and_Tracking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location and Tracking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Characters", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/11/655e9789cc3fd0.35760085.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503908", "eventUri": "eng-9503908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The letter was in response to a request made by the board, ranchers and several law enforcement groups asking for the removal of reintroduced wolves through \"lethal force.\"\n\nIn its response, CPW wrote that killing the male wolf \"would be irresponsible management.\"\n\n\"It's way too early in this program to be killing wolves,\" said Michael Saul with the Defenders of Wildlife. \"There are still so many non-lethal solutions available to try.\"\n\nCPW is still working to confirm the den.\n\n\"It shows that the plan is working,\" said Saul. \"Colorado-born pups, I hope that's something we can all get excited about.\"\n\nEnvironment\n\nCPW doc tracks livestock killed by wolves; shows no claims made since December Stephanie Butzer 1:11 PM, Apr 24, 2024\n\nThe male wolf is believed to be responsible for several depredation incidents.

Three yearling cattle were killed by wolves in Grand County on April 17. The next day, a fourth yearling cattle was killed on the same property.\n\nIn line with the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, the livestock producer is eligible for fair market value compensation if they submit a claim, CPW said. That plan describes the legal requirement to provide fair compensation to livestock owners for any economic losses if their animals are injured or killed by wolves. If livestock or a guard animal is injured or killed, the wolf-livestock compensation program will pay for 100% of fair market value compensation, up to $15,000 per animal.

PAUL -- Sen. Nathan Wesenberg, R-Little Falls, sits down to talk about wolf management in Minnesota and what he thinks the state should do about it.\n\nWesenberg has been one of a handful of legislators who have been vocal about the need for a wolf hunt in Minnesota. Reports from constituents and his knowledge as a biologist who once worked for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources have led him to believe that the growing wolf population in Minnesota means they should be taken off the endangered species list and that a seasonal wolf hunt in Minnesota should be instituted.\n\nWesenberg represents all of Morrison and Aitkin counties and parts of Mille Lacs, Kanabec and Benton counties. He was first elected to the Minnesota Senate in 2022.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Watch the video for the full interview.\n\nCan you give me a brief explanation of the wolf issue in Minnesota?\n\nIn Minnesota, we have a population of wolves that isn't being managed properly. With any wildlife population, we need to manage it. There was a time when people were trying to extirpate the wolves, but in Minnesota, they just were never able to get rid of all of them, which is good. So we put them on the Endangered Species Act to try to keep them from going extinct.\n\nA paper that the DNR wrote says the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted to have 1,200 to 1,400 wolves in Minnesota, and then they'd be removed from the Endangered Species Act. That goal was set for the year 2000. By the late 1990s, we were at like 2,500 wolves. ... So we've reached our goal and now there's too many wolves. The DNR also said that they believe the population would double every 15 to 25 years. If you use that math, now you can safely say, even conservatively, there's 5,000 wolves in the state, right?\n\nPeople are having cattle killed, people are seeing them on trail camera. I think in 2017, just northeast of Anoka, federal trappers trapped a pack of wolves and took them out because they're killing cattle. We know they're here.\n\nThe solution is, we need to properly manage them. We don't want to extricate the wolves. We just need to look at the science, and the science says that the wolves are hurting our deer herd. The DNR will say it's the winters that are causing the deer (to decline). Yes, we have bad winters and that leads for less survivability because some will starve to death. Does will have less fawns, but when you have many severe winters back to back, and then if you also have high snow levels, it's hard for the deer to get around but the wolves have evolved to run on top of the snow. It's easier for them to catch a deer when there's more snow. With severe winters and a high wolf population, we're not going to get that deer herd back in northeastern Minnesota unless we manage the wolves to get the wolf number down.\n\nNow we're seeing more wolf conflict to the southwest of that area and farmers are losing cattle. (A member) of the Farmers Association said that in Minnesota, they estimate we've lost over 200 cattle farms in the last 20 years just because of wolves. People quit farming or they left the state because they're not getting reimbursed. Now the DNR will say people are getting reimbursed, but I've heard it's estimated that maybe 1 in 10 farmers are getting reimbursed for the wolves that are eating their cattle. That's not fair to the farmer.\n\nTell me about your time with the Minnesota DNR.\n\nI have a degree in wildlife biology and I've always just been interested in science and the outdoors. I grew up hunting and fishing and just in the woods all the time, and I got scholarships for science as a top science student. I graduated with a degree in wildlife biology.\n\nI started in, I think, 2001. I was an intern with invasive species. I talked to people about zebra mussels and things like lake access. Then I started volunteering at Camp Ripley. There, we worked on things like bear, eagles, wolves, deer, turtles. When I graduated, I was working in Brainerd. In my free time, when I wasn't working for the DNR, I was volunteering for the DNR in Camp Ridley. I worked for three years there and I just didn't agree with how they were treating science, so I quit.\n\nI farmed for about five years, then I started my own wildlife research company. Then the DNR hired me as a private contractor to do wildlife research. I've worked on golden eagles, I've worked on wolves for almost 20 years. I've worked with wolf biologists and I've tracked wolves with GPS. We use telemetry units. I'd go in the woods and count them.\n\nWe want to study the wolves because we want to preserve them, and we want to save them. But we got to a point in, like, 2014 where we did not need to collar wolves anymore because we have the data. We understand they came back. They're everywhere. We need to start managing them.\n\nWhat's the solution here and how should the state go about implementing it?\n\nIn 2012, '13 and '14, the state did have a wolf season. We already know how to do it, we just have to do it.\n\nOne thing that I've heard from people is when we kill the wolf then they're gone. Wolves are dogs, they have four to six pups in spring. If you take one out, there will be more pups, and they repopulate. That's why the population doesn't go down. If there's less mouths to feed, more pups are going to survive the next spring. That's the biology.\n\nThe DNR does have a new management plan. I've read through it, and in there, it says once we get to above a 3,000 threshold -- we are there now -- we'll talk about having a wolf season. No, we have to have a wolf season, we can't (just) talk about it.\n\nThe wolves are also losing fear of humans. If they weren't, they wouldn't be killing deer next to people's houses. People are sending me pictures of wolves eating each other. They don't do that unless they're starving, people. They're going through town in the middle of the day. We can't wait for someone to get killed before we start managing them. That's not acceptable.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Jared Polis and Colorado Parks and Wildlife to remove wolves behind recent cattle killings.\n\nThe groups are concerned that the 10 new wolves reintroduced under a voter-approved mandate are a threat to their livelihoods after a string of five Grand County depredations. Depredations refers to an act of preying upon or robbery from someone. CPW also confirmed a calf was killed in Jackson County this month.\n\nThe stock growers are pointing to various information included in the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan that says wolves with a history of chronic depredation should not be translocated and should also not be sourced from areas with chronic depredations.\n\n\"Constant and chronic depredation of animals ranging from cows and calves to sheep and\n\neven family dogs has been ongoing for over two years at this point and CPW has made no\n\nmeasurable effort to support ranchers or manage conflict wolves,\" said the Larimer County Stock Growers Association in its letter to the Colorado Wildlife Commission.\n\nSheriff calls depredations a matter of 'public safety'\n\nLethal deterrents are illegal. According to CPW's website, a depredation must be confirmed before CPW will allow a rancher to take lethal action against a wolf.\n\nGrand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin also wrote to the state asking for relief.\n\n\"It is my duty as the County Sheriff to prioritize Public Safety and to address a safety lapse when I feel that we are falling short,\" he wrote. \"In this case, we have a clear Public Safety concern, couple with increased concerns over private property rights and it is our obligation as leaders to do the right thing, even when the right thing isn't always the easiest solution.\"\n\nSchroetlin requested that CPW or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \"lethally remove\" the two wolves allegedly killing the five calves in Grand County.\n\n\"Without this immediate action, you are ultimately failing the great citizens of this country; many of whom are multi-generational ranching families and businesses, and setting poor precedence for further encounters in Grand County and most likely other areas in our region that will soon be following suit,\" Schroetlin said.\n\nStock growers groups speak out\n\nThe association claimed that there are eight counties where collared wolves have been recorded on CPW's watershed map. The group also alleged that seven of those counties were opposed to the state ballot measure on wolf reintroduction by margins of 53-88%.\n\nThe association also stated that these counties have over 130,000 head of cattle or 5% of the state's total livestock populations. The group said these counties' livestock production provides over $158 million in economic impact to the state.\n\nOn the other hand, the association declared, the total cattle numbers for the 13 counties that voted in favor of wolf reintroduction are about 141,000 or 5.4% of the state's livestock population.\n\n\"It seems only natural that communication would be of utmost importance to the communities who are the most adversely affected,\" the Larimer County Stock Growers said. \"Yet the opposite is becoming truer with each passing day. CPW has the technology to track reintroduced wolves in real time and, rather than give proactive information to ranchers and residents alike in direct vicinity of collared wolves, you are choosing to release vague locations days and weeks after the fact. This is leading to increased wolf-livestock conflict and further alienating those that should be your partners in conservation.\"\n\nThe Middle Park Stockgrowers also sent a letter to the state, noting that Grand County producers have \"diligently\" implemented a \"comprehensive suite of non-lethal deterrents,\" which include fox lights, maintaining a presence near cattle throughout the night, implementing carcass management strategies and utilizing cracker shells.\n\nColorado Governor's Office responds\n\nIn a statement sent late Monday night, a spokesperson from the Colorado Governor's Office said lethal control of wolves when only 12 are in the state is \"premature.\"\n\n\"It is widely known that wolves are opportunistic hunters and Colorado voters were fully aware of the diet of wolves and made the decision to reintroduce wolves. Now CPW and CDA will work with ranchers on how to successfully and non-lethally deter predation, as is being done successfully in many other states that have both vibrant and successful ranching sectors and a much larger population of wolves than Colorado,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe state reimburses confirmed wolf-caused depredations on cattle, up to $15,000 per loss. The spokesperson added that the state has established a dedicated Wolf Depredation Compensation cash fund of $175,000, provided from the state's general fund. The compensation fund will receive an additional $350,000 per fiscal year to keep a healthy balance in the fund on an ongoing basis.\n\nCPW has spending authority for up to $175,000 in the current fiscal year from this fund to compensate livestock owners for wolf depredation. CPW also requested increased ongoing spending authority of up to $525,000 per year beginning in the next fiscal year, which is currently being considered by the General Assembly as part of the Long Bill which will be signed into law.\n\n\"The Colorado Department of Agriculture and CPW continue to work with the Middle Park Stockgrowers and the Grand County community on a plan that would help employ non-lethal deterrent tactics, such as range riders,\" the governor's office spokesperson said. \"While the department's budget request to the legislature for scaling up range riders is pending at the legislature and will likely be signed next week, CDA and CPW are deploying available resources to provide immediate support and are working on a plan to deploy on-the-ground assistance through range riders this month.\"\n\nThe state has plans to introduce more wolves between December and March 2025, intending to release between 30-50 wolves in the next five years.", "source": {"uri":

The letter was in response to a request made by the board, ranchers and several law enforcement groups asking for the removal of reintroduced wolves through \"lethal force.\"\n\nIn its response, CPW wrote that killing the male wolf \"would be irresponsible management.\"\n\n\"It's way too early in this program to be killing wolves,\" said Michael Saul with the Defenders of Wildlife. \"There are still so many non-lethal solutions available to try.\"\n\nCPW is still working to confirm the den.\n\n\"It shows that the plan is working,\" said Saul. \"Colorado-born pups, I hope that's something we can all get excited about.\"\n\nLocal News\n\nCPW doc tracks livestock killed by wolves; shows no claims made since December Stephanie Butzer 1:11 PM, Apr 24, 2024\n\nThe male wolf is believed to be responsible for several depredation incidents. In total, six animals have been killed by wolves since their reintroduction in December 2023.\n\nThe first depredation incident was on April 2 in Grand County, The second incident happened five days later in Jackson County. Three yearling cattle were killed by wolves in Grand County on April 17. The next day, a fourth yearling cattle was killed on the same property.\n\nIn line with the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, the livestock producer is eligible for fair market value compensation if they submit a claim, CPW said. That plan describes the legal requirement to provide fair compensation to livestock owners for any economic losses if their animals are injured or killed by wolves. If livestock or a guard animal is injured or killed, the wolf-livestock compensation program will pay for 100% of fair market value compensation, up to $15,000 per animal. A detailed layout of the compensation options is outlined on page 33 of the management plan here.\n\nEnvironment\n\nGray wolf released by CPW in December 2023 found dead in Larimer County Sydney Isenberg 9:54 PM, Apr 23, 2024\n\nHowever, data shows no claims have been submitted since the reintroduction in December. The Middle Park Stockgrowers Board said the state needs to re-work the reimbursement process.\n\n\"I've talked a little bit with one of the producers about the reimbursement process, and it needs to be worked through more,\" said Tim Ritschard, the board's president.\n\nRitschard said privacy concerns could be responsible for the lack of claims since the name of the producer could be found in an open records request. He said there are no plans for a lawsuit from the ranchers or the Middle Park Stockgrowers board, but they are concerned about the possibility of wolf pups.\n\n\"The mom and dad will have to teach them how to survive,\" said Ritschard. \"We'll see more depredations then.\"\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

An autopsy has not been completed, but no foul play was believed to be indicated early on; therefore, natural causes are likely for that death.\n\nThe anticipation and implementation of the gray wolf restoration program have maintained controversy in the state for years.

The Nature and Forest Agency said it had most likely been killed by a predator. Based on a report by its experts, the administration could not rule out the possibility of this being a wolf.\n\nFor the purpose of genetic analysis, samples were taken from the calf's bite wounds in the hope of capturing enough saliva with usable DNA from the perpetrator. The samples are being sent to the Senckenberg Institute in Gelnhausen, Germany, which is the reference laboratory in this area. The results are expected in a few weeks.\n\nThe Nature and Forest Agency noted that there have been regular confirmed records of lone wolves in Luxembourg since 2017. In nearby countries, for example in the High Fens in Belgium, wolf packs have been living again for several years.\n\nMembers of the public are asked to immediately report any possible evidence of the presence of wolves to the Nature and Forest Agency for monitoring purposes via email: wolf@anf.etat.lu.\n\nThe administration recalled that wolves are strictly protected throughout Europe. They play an important role in our ecosystems, where as a top predator they can contribute to reducing excessive densities of hoofed game. Luxembourg has been preparing for the possible return of the wolf in recent years in order to define how to deal with this animal species from the outset. This forms part of the action and management plan for dealing with wolves in Luxembourg, which was drawn up and presented to the public together with all stakeholders from agriculture, science, nature conservation, private forest owners and hunting.\n\nThe administration added that wolves generally avoid direct contact with humans. Encounters between humans and wolves are therefore extremely rare, but not impossible. The brochure \"W\u00f6lfe in Luxemburg?\" (Wolves in Luxembourg?) explains the rules of conduct that should be followed in the event of an encounter with a wolf, namely: do not run away, as this can trigger the animal's hunting instinct; do not move towards the wolf, always keep an eye on the wolf but avoid eye contact; get the wolf's attention, call out and wave your arms. If the wolf does not retreat immediately, move back slowly and create a respectful distance; if the wolf continues to approach, continue to call out to him and throw branches, stones, etc. at him; never try to attract wolves with food.\n\nThe wolf action plan and the brochure on rules of conduct are available online free of charge and in print from the Nature and Forest Agency via tel.: 247-56652, as well as in the administration's visitor centres: Mirador in Steinfort, A Wiewesch in Manternach, Ellergronn in Esch-sur-Alzette, Biodiversum in Remerschen and Burfelt near Insenborn.",

"Wildlife groups threaten feds with lawsuit over wolf protections", "body": "(The Center Square) - A coalition of animal welfare and wildlife advocacy groups plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over gray wolf protections, pointing to the killing of a wolf in Wyoming as an example of why the species needs more protection.\n\nIn 2021, the USFWS said relisting \"may be warranted,\" but a final decision in February declined to relist gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act in the northern Rocky Mountain states, where they are regulated at the state level.\n\nAnimal Wellness Action, Center for a Humane Economy, Footloose Montana, and other groups pointed to an incident in Wyoming where a man captured and tortured a gray wolf before killing it, as reported by Cowboy State Daily.\n\n\"Three weeks after this decision, a man in Wyoming ran down a gray wolf with a snowmobile, captured her, taped her muzzle shut, paraded her in a local bar while subjecting her to extended abuse -- including going so far as to kiss the dying wolf while being filmed, the wolf too weak to do anything but bare her teeth -- and finally killing her,\" the groups said in a press release. \"While Animal Wellness Action argues that these actions are punishable under Wyoming criminal law, and numerous veteran law enforcement professionals have called for felony charges, he was required only to pay a $250 fine for live possession of wildlife.\"\n\nGray wolves are currently listed under the ESA as endangered in 44 states, while states maintain jurisdiction in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, as well as parts of Oregon, Washington and Utah.\n\n\"With its latest Finding, the FWS is repeating many of the same mistakes it has made in its many prior attempts to delist the gray wolf from ESA protection and the action is likely to face the same outcome as these earlier efforts,\" the groups' intent to sue letter said.\n\nIn a statement, Footloose Montana's Jessica Karjala says states have proven they \"cannot be trusted\" to sustain the wolf species.\n\n\"They not only allow but endorse bounties on wolves,\" she said. \"They have encouraged increased hunting and quotas on wolves, spotlighting, baiting, trapping, snaring, hound hunting.\"\n\nThe Center Square previously reported on a lawsuit against USFWS challenging the agency's February decision by The

"Wildlife groups threaten feds with lawsuit over wolf protections", "body": "(The Center Square) - A coalition of animal welfare and wildlife advocacy groups plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over gray wolf protections, pointing to the killing of a wolf in Wyoming as an example of why the species needs more protection.\n\nIn 2021, the USFWS said relisting \"may be warranted,\" but a final decision in February declined to relist gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act in the northern Rocky Mountain states, where they are regulated at the state level.\n\nAnimal Wellness Action, Center for a Humane Economy, Footloose Montana, and other groups pointed to an incident in Wyoming where a man captured and tortured a gray wolf before killing it, as reported by Cowboy State Daily.\n\n\"Three weeks after this decision, a man in Wyoming ran down a gray wolf with a snowmobile, captured her, taped her muzzle shut, paraded her in a local bar while subjecting her to extended abuse -- including going so far as to kiss the dying wolf while being filmed, the wolf too weak to do anything but bare her teeth -- and finally killing her,\" the groups said in a press release. \"While Animal Wellness Action argues that these actions are punishable under Wyoming criminal law, and numerous veteran law enforcement professionals have called for felony charges, he was required only to pay a $250 fine for live possession of wildlife.\"\n\nGray wolves are currently listed under the ESA as endangered in 44 states, while states maintain jurisdiction in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, as well as parts of Oregon, Washington and Utah.\n\nMore from this section The 'secret' auto insurance you didn't know existed Honduras seizes 2.7 tonnes of cocaine smuggled

wolf from ESA protection and the action is likely to face the same outcome as these earlier efforts,\" the groups' intent to sue letter said.\n\nIn a statement, Footloose Montana's Jessica Karjala says states have proven they \"cannot be trusted\" to sustain the wolf species.\n\n\"They not only allow but endorse bounties on wolves,\" she said. \"They have encouraged increased hunting and quotas on wolves, spotlighting, baiting, trapping, snaring, hound hunting.\"\n\nThe Center Square previously reported on a lawsuit against USFWS challenging the agency's February decision by The Center for

As a result, large predators are one of the animal groups that have seen their ranges most diminished, often approaching extinction.\n\nThe wolf (Canis lupus) is a clear example of what happens to species that we perceive as negative. Its current distribution throughout the world covers only 50% of what it had a few centuries ago. The species has disappeared from most of Europe, North America and the most populated areas of Asia.\n\nIn Spain, the wolf is included in the List of Wild Species under Special Protection Regime (LESPRE), but this April 23, a bill is being debated in parliament, presented by the Popular Parliamentary Group, which aims to lower the protection regime. protection of the populations north of the Duero, including their management through hunting.\n\nIn Spain there were wolves everywhere. However, centuries ago human pressure banished the species from the most productive lands, relegating it to rugged terrain. In the 19th century the wolf had become rare on the Mediterranean coast and was missing in the most populated areas.\n\nThe decline of the species was accentuated in the 20th century, with the spread of strychnine and other poisons. Even so, an article published in Montes magazine in 1947 considered that 18 Spanish provinces were \"heavily infected\" by wolves, and encouraged the annihilation of the species, repeating the (supposed) successes of the United Kingdom or the United States.\n\nIn that same magazine, and just a quarter of a century later, another article showed the collapse of the wolf in Spain, pointing out that \"we are capable of exterminating the wolf in a few years.\" The species' distribution reached its minimum throughout the 1970s.\n\nThe decline of the wolf in the Iberian Peninsula was not further aggravated due to changes in the perception of the species - in particular, thanks to F\u00e9lix Rodr\u00edguez de la Fuente - and in the uses of the territory (depopulation), but probably not due to the protection of legal protection.\n\nSince its historic lows, the wolf has regained territory, although it has remained largely confined to the northwest of the peninsula, occupying less than 30% of the area it had in the 19th century.\n\nIn recent decades, both the estimated number of individuals or groups and the geographical distribution of the species have remained practically stable, in both cases with a growth slightly greater than zero. Furthermore, in this period the extinction of the last southern population of the species took place, in the eastern Sierra Morena.\n\nProtection came through the 1992 European Union Habitats Directive, transposed into Spanish legislation in 1995, which differentiated the management of the species north and south of the Duero River, with a stricter protection regime in the latter. case. This geographical differentiation is only useful in the northwest of Iberia, and is a burden that dragged the management of the species until 2021.\n\nIn that year, the wolf was included in the List of Wild Species under Special Protection Regime, which equalized the protection of the wolf throughout the state, its hunting was prohibited and the control measures were given an exceptional nature. the species.\n\nIn recent years there have been important political movements to promote relaxation in wolf protection measures. The European Commission (EC) spurred this debate by proclaiming that the (alleged) concentration of wolf groups poses a danger to livestock and people. Curiously, the Commission copied the words used by its president, Ursula von der Lyen, after wolves killed one of her ponies.\n\nContrary to widespread opinion in the scientific community, in December 2023, the EC officially proposed changing the international status of wolves from \"strictly protected\" to \"protected.\"\n\nIn Spain the discussion has been particularly bitter and has pivoted on the inclusion of the wolf in the LESPRE, which is related to the expansion of the wolf, increase in its population and increases in attacks on livestock. It seems unlikely that this has happened since 2021. The relaxation of the protection provided for in the new bill is promoted in the interest of \"the (defense of) extensive livestock farming and the fight against the demographic challenge.\" But the wolf has little to do with all this.\n\nWhat is discussed on April 23 will not be about the wolf, nor its conservation nor extensive livestock farming. Nor about depopulation. Feelings will be appealed and symbols will be displayed. And the wolf is the most powerful symbol.\n\nExtensive livestock farming has very important problems that hinder its viability in many territories, both in those that have wolves and in those in which the species has not existed for decades.\n\nThe most important of all is the unequal competition with industrial livestock farming, which lowers prices, promotes changes in consumer habits and makes it impossible for people to make an extensive living from their activity. The regulatory structure is tremendously favorable to industrial production, not differentiating it from extensive production, preventing favorable commercialization of the latter.\n\nIndustrial livestock farming obtains this insurmountable advantage at the cost of harming the common good in many aspects (energy use, pollution) and at an enormous cost in terms of animal welfare. We all pay for the very low prices with which it places its products on the market in the form of unsustainability, loss of environmental services and health. And at the expense of extensive livestock farming.\n\nIn this context, the media insistence on attacks on livestock, its supposed increase and its incompatibility with livestock farming points to the wolf, as if it were an old story, as the evil ideal.\n\nHowever, the damage caused by the wolf is largely avoidable with preventive measures and, in general, compensable. And I say in general because it is very difficult to have access to real data on damages reported, evaluated and paid. In reality, all extensive livestock farms, whether or not they coexist with wolves, lose individuals due to predation, often by dogs that roam uncontrolled.\n\nThe bill aims to allow the slaughter of wolves as a management measure north of the Duero. But this supposed control of the populations is not clear that it means less damage to livestock and mitigates the associated conflict. In fact, the effect could be the opposite, due to the destabilization of wolf groups.\n\nOur natural systems are lacking a key element if they do not have wolves. The wolf is essential in the functioning of ecosystems, controlling herbivore populations and their activity, giving rise to what is known as landscapes of fear. These effects generate other effects in a chain, which affect the vegetation, the incidence of diseases and the provision of food for other species.\n\nOur goal should be for the wolf to recover as much of its historical range as possible and to have healthy and viable populations in the territories already occupied. To achieve this, it is essential that the wolf is not the symbol of a cultural war that appeals mainly to feelings and puts aside facts, problems and solutions.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

"title": "Wildlife groups threaten feds with lawsuit over wolf protections", "body": "(The Center Square) - A coalition of animal welfare and wildlife advocacy groups plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over gray wolf protections, pointing to the killing of a wolf in Wyoming as an example of why the species needs more protection.\n\nIn 2021, the USFWS said relisting \"may be warranted,\" but a final decision in February declined to relist gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act in the northern Rocky Mountain states, where they are regulated at the state level.\n\nAnimal Wellness Action, Center for a Humane Economy, Footloose Montana, and other groups pointed to an incident in Wyoming where a man captured and tortured a gray wolf before killing it, as reported by Cowboy State Daily.\n\n\"Three weeks after this decision, a man in Wyoming ran down a gray wolf with a snowmobile, captured her, taped her muzzle shut, paraded her in a local bar while subjecting her to extended abuse -- including going so far as to kiss the dying wolf while being filmed, the wolf too weak to do anything but bare her teeth -- and finally killing her,\" the groups said in a press release. \"While Animal Wellness Action argues that these actions are punishable under Wyoming criminal law, and numerous veteran law enforcement professionals have called for felony charges, he was required only to pay a $250 fine for live possession of wildlife.\"\n\nGray wolves are currently listed under the ESA as endangered in 44 states, while states maintain jurisdiction in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, as well as parts of Oregon, Washington and Utah.\n\n\"With its latest Finding, the FWS is repeating many of the same mistakes it has made in its many prior attempts to delist the gray wolf from ESA protection and the action is likely to face the same outcome as these earlier efforts,\" the groups' intent to sue letter said.\n\nIn a statement, Footloose Montana's Jessica Karjala says states have proven they \"cannot be trusted\" to sustain the wolf species.\n\n\"They not only allow but endorse bounties on wolves,\" she said. \"They have encouraged increased hunting and quotas on wolves, spotlighting, baiting, trapping, snaring, hound hunting.\"\n\nThe Center Square previously reported on a lawsuit against USFWS challenging the agency's February decision by The Center for Biological Diversity, the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Sierra Club.\n\nMore from this section\n\nConcordia Announces Strategic Partnership with

This includes directly interviewing sources and analyzing primary source documents.\n\nRanchers in Grand, Jackson and Larimer counties, the Grand County sheriff and the Colorado Wool Growers Association have sent six letters in the past week asking Gov. Jared Polis and Colorado Parks and Wildlife to kill four wolves blamed for the deaths of six cows in Grand and Jackson counties in the past 16 days.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Polis and CPW on Monday, the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association reiterated a request it sent April 18 for the immediate removal of two wolves from known depredating packs in Oregon that have been killing cattle in Grand County. A letter sent Monday from the North Park Stockgrowers Association said it \"proudly stands united\" with Middle Park and requested CPW kill two wolves responsible for the death of one calf and injury of another in Jackson County that entered Colorado from Wyoming.\n\nGrand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin in his letter cited five confirmed deaths in Grand County, adding \"this number of depredations is believed to be higher as our community continues to learn about wolf practices and patterns here firsthand in our county.\"\n\nThe Larimer County Stockgrowers Association, which added its letter to the mix Monday afternoon, wrote to Polis and CPW \"in solidarity with (its) brothers and sisters in animal husbandry from the Middle and North Park Communities.\"\n\n\"The tenuous nature of these now chronic depredation events requires a greater level of communication, transparency and commitment to the stewards of agriculture who keep our great state fed,\" the letter said.\n\nThe Middle Park letter focuses on rules around chronic depredation in Washington state, because Colorado does not have its own rules -- a fact that rankled stockgrowers for years before the Oregon wolves were brought here in late 2023.\n\nWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife rules state that three confirmed kills in 30 days or four depredations in a 10-month \"rolling window\" justify lethal removal.\n\nBut CPW has yet to release its rules around chronic depredation, with Jeff Davis, the CPW director, telling lawmakers in January the agency's \"goal is to review all states that have wolves and what they put into their chronic depredation definition and figure out criteria.\" Davis joined CPW in March 2023 after 23 years at Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\nTravis Duncan, a CPW spokesperson, on Monday said the agency's staff is \"working on a definition of 'chronic depredation.' It will be going through our regulatory process and will most likely be scheduled to be heard by our commission at its June or July meeting.\"\n\nGrand County Commissioner Meritt Linke said Monday afternoon he didn't understand why Polis, CPW and the Colorado Department of Agriculture had not responded to the letter the stockgrowers sent at 8 a.m. that morning.\n\n\"I mean, they have our numbers. They could at least text us,\" he said.\n\nThe lack of specifics around what counts as chronic depredation \"is something that should have been figured out prior to the wolves' release,\" he added. It must be figured out before more wolves are brought to Colorado \"and depredation becomes a huge runaway-train problem.\"\n\nLinke said ranchers are using all of the nonlethal wolf deterrent measures CPW and the Colorado Department of Agriculture have recommended, but \"they have a shelf life. They're only effective for a short time. We know this from talking to surrounding states from firsthand evidence. Why didn't Colorado learn from this?\"\n\nHe added although ranchers are compensated at fair market value for cattle killed by wolves, the money often doesn't come close to compensating a rancher for all of the expenses of raising cattle. A rancher might give a calf to a neighbor's cow if the cow loses its calf, for instance, while a yearling can go for $3,000, he said.\n\n\"The hidden costs of raising cattle are not just cut and dried,\" he added. \"When cows are stressed, they might not have as good a conception rate, or they might not have as good a weight gain through the summer. If you have 400 or 500 cows and they gain 25 fewer pounds, there's some pretty good loss right there. And extra time and labor -- some of these ranchers who've had wolves around are literally sleeping in their pastures. Yes, the state has been trying to get us a range rider program, but how's that going to work in a place like Grand County, which is 1,869 square miles?\"\n\nSchroetlin said in his letter to CPW and Polis it is his duty to \"prioritize public safety and to address a safety lapse when I feel we are falling short.\" He said \"an immediate decision\" around lethally removing the two introduced wolves that have been killing livestock in his county is needed, and that without immediate action \"you are ultimately failing the great citizens of this county,\" and \"setting a poor precedent for future encounters.\"\n\nA representative for state agriculture commissioner Kate Greenberg said she did not respond to the letters because \"as a member of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission, she is not in a position to respond on behalf of the entire board.\"\n\nIn the Colorado Wool Growers Association letter sent late Monday afternoon, the organization said, \"Allowing chronic depredators to persist on the landscape is literally throwing our livestock to the wolves, and will only perpetuate the problem as existing and new pack members learn to prey on livestock and our working dogs.\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tracy_ross@coloradosun.com", "name": "Tracy Ross", "type": "author",

The animal has been portrayed for decades in films as a vociferous predator, however, speaking to HELLO! as part of The Big Give, businessman and environmentalist Ben Goldsmith explains why this is an unearned reputation.\n\nSpeaking about the success stories of recent re-wilding attempts, including beavers being re-introduced to Britain, he said: \"The recovery of Europe's larger wildlife, from beavers to brown bears, is one of the greatest conservation success stories ever. The return of wolves is perhaps the most remarkable, given how committed earlier generations had been to their eradication.\n\n\"Only on Europe's larger islands, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Sicily, is the return of key wildlife species still awaited. Considered the devil incarnate, for centuries wolves were remorselessly hunted, trapped and dragged back to be ritually burned or torn apart by dogs before baying crowds. A whole-of-society effort was mustered to do away with them.\"\n\nBen highlighted how the absence of wolves from the natural habitat can actually be harmful for the environment, using the Scottish Highlands as an example. \"The beautiful but utterly denuded Highlands of Scotland show what happens in wild landscapes stripped of their wolves,\" he said.\n\n\"Deer numbers explode, stripping the hills and glens of their young trees, rich scrub and wildflowers and unleashing an ecosystem collapse which the Highlands, and Ireland, have in common with swathes of Sicily. The absence of wolves is felt more acutely still in our agriculturally productive landscapes, where food production is now threatened by growing hordes of hungry deer.\"\n\nHowever, despite wolves being so important for the natural food chain, they are still facing issues from people who worry about their reputation and farmers who are worried that the animals may attack their own livestock. \"On the continent however, wolves are back in growing numbers, and with them, calls for eradication from a small but vociferous minority,\" Ben told us. \"The killing of wolves has already begun in Sweden, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nDisspelling some of the myths around wolves, he added: \"The justification given is shaky, including the dangers posed by wolves to pets, livestock and even to people, even though wolves are timid, avoiding humans at all costs. Certainly, wolves are a nuisance for some livestock farmers, but the scale of the impact is substantially overstated. France's burgeoning wolf population accounted for just 0.2% of all the sheep lost to natural causes last year. Meanwhile, increasingly effective wolf coexistence measures are being rolled out across Europe's pastoral landscapes.\n\n\"How can we lecture countries far poorer than ours on co-existence with leopards, lions and tigers if we can't find it within ourselves to tolerate secretive, far-less-scary wolves in our own midst? We should look seriously at restoring wolves to Britain. Is the idea really so mad? There are now more wolves in the densely populated, intensively farmed Netherlands than there are in Norway!\n\nBen is the chair of the Conservation Collective, which works towards \"supporting efforts towards coexistence with wildlife and wilder landscapes\". Sharing more about the charity, Ben said: \"The conversation is underway not just here in Britain, but in Sicily, where the marvellous Sicily Environment Fund, part of the Conservation Collective. The charity, like hundreds of others doing vital work on the environment, is taking part in Big Give's Green Match Fund which runs until April 25 and will double all public donations made via

CPW also released an updated map of the animals' movements over the past month.\n\nThe first confirmed wolf attack on livestock in the wake of the December reintroduction happened on April 2 in Grand County, in which one calf died. The same sort of incident happened on April 7 in Jackson County. On April 17, three cattle were killed by wolves in Grand County, and the following day, a fourth cow was killed on the same property.\n\nCPW doc tracks livestock killed by wolves; shows no claims made since December\n\nAs part of the state's voter-mandated gray wolf reintroduction effort, CPW released its first five wolves on Dec. 18, 2023 at an undisclosed place in Grand County. Five more were released a few days later in Grand and Summit counties.\n\nCPW confirmed that the wolf or wolves in the area at the same time as the first, third and fourth depredation incidents were part of the 10 animals that were reintroduced to Colorado in December. Four wolves were in the same area at the time of the second depredation, three of which were from the groups brought to the state in December.\n\nCPW released the full list of gray wolf depredations in this document, which will be updated. It currently reads:\n\nApril 18, 2024. Grand County. No claim submitted. 1 cattle involved.April 17, 2024. Grand County. No claim submitted. 3 cattle involved.April 7, 2024. Jackson County.

Claim received: $1,252.72. 2 dogs involved.December 19, 2021. Jackson County. Claim received: $1,800.00. 1 calf involved.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the ranch owners from the April 2024 incidents had not yet submitted a claim for the lost livestock to CPW. If a claim is submitted, livestock producers can be eligible for the fair market value of the livestock, in line with the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, which was approved in May 2023. CPW will also provide conflict minimization materials to livestock producers in the affected areas.\n\nIt is not yet clear why the claims have not been submitted yet. Denver7 reached out to CPW and other local ranchers for insight.\n\nThe Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan describes the legal requirement to provide fair compensation to livestock owners for any economic losses if their animals are injured or killed by wolves. If livestock or a guard animal is injured or killed, the wolf-livestock compensation program will pay for 100% of fair market value compensation, up to $15,000 per animal. A detailed layout of the compensation options is outlined on page 33 of the management plan here.\n\nCPW and the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) are currently working to finalize a program to partner livestock producers with range riders, the latter of which provides a deterrent for predators that may be near livestock herds. CDA has a budget request in the legislature that includes funding the range riders. CPW and CDA are also working to offer other non-lethal tools to ranchers.\n\nIn addition to sharing the depredation document on Wednesday, CPW also published its monthly updated map of where the wolves have moved in the past month. The below map illustrates the watersheds where they traveled between March 26 and April 23.\n\nThis appears to be the first map to show that the collared wolves have ventured near or into Rocky Mountain National Park and northeast of Estes Park since December.\n\nFor a watershed to indicate wolf activity, CPW must have data for at least one GPS point from a wolf collar within the watershed boundaries. Just because a watershed is purple in the above map does not mean the animals are present throughout the entire watershed, CPW said.\n\nThe CPW Commission will meet May 1-2 to discuss multiple topics, including changing rules to allow the use of artificial light for wolves causing damage, allowing pooled grazers to apply for wolf permits and compensation, and defining domestic bison as livestock so those livestock owners can be reimbursed when applicable.", "source": {"uri": "koaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KOAA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephanie_butzer@koaa.com", "name": "Stephanie

The \"Washington Gray Wolf Conservation and Management 2023 Annual Report\" indicates a 20% increase in the state's wolf population from the previous year, with a total of 260 wolves across 42 packs, including 25 successful breeding pairs.\n\nThe 2023 report reveals that seven new or reestablished wolf packs were identified, marking continued expansion across the state. New packs were confirmed in Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Stevens, and Asotin counties, as well as three additional packs in Ferry County, overlapping with the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (CTCR). WDFW Director Kelly Susewind mentioned that wolves are also being observed south of Interstate 90, hinting at future packs in the South Cascades and Northwest Coast regions.\n\nDespite the growing number of wolves, there has not been a significant increase in depredation events involving domestic animals. In 2023, there were 23 confirmed or probable depredation events, with only two packs involved in two or more incidents. This low rate of depredation can be attributed to the collaborative efforts between livestock producers, WDFW staff, and various community partners.\n\nWDFW Statewide Wolf Specialist Ben Maletzke acknowledged these cooperative efforts, highlighting the significant investment in time and resources required to maintain low depredation rates. These efforts have also contributed to a reduced need for lethal wolf removals, promoting a more harmonious coexistence between wolves and livestock operations.\n\nWDFW has released its first-ever status review for wolves in Washington, recommending a reclassification from \"Endangered\" to \"Sensitive\" status, due to significant progress toward recovery objectives. The Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission will decide on this proposal in July. However, wolves remain federally listed in the western two-thirds of the state, with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) leading the wolf recovery efforts in those regions.\n\nThe 2023 annual wolf report also recognizes the efforts of various agencies and tribal groups in supporting wolf recovery in Washington. These groups include the USFWS, National Park Service, Spokane Tribe of Indians, Swinomish Tribe, Yakama Nation, and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.

If a claim is submitted, livestock producers can be eligible for the fair market value of the livestock, in line with the Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan, which was approved in May 2023. CPW will also provide conflict minimization materials to livestock producers in the affected areas.\n\nIt is not yet clear why the claims have not been submitted yet. Denver7 reached out to CPW and other local ranchers for insight.\n\nThe Colorado Wolf Restoration and Management Plan describes the legal requirement to provide fair compensation to livestock owners for any economic losses if their animals are injured or killed by wolves. If livestock or a guard animal is injured or killed, the wolf-livestock compensation program will pay for 100% of fair market value compensation, up to $15,000 per animal. A detailed layout of the compensation options is outlined on page 33 of the management plan here.\n\nCPW and the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) are currently working to finalize a program to partner livestock producers with range riders, the latter of which provides a deterrent for predators that may be near livestock herds. CDA has a budget request in the legislature that includes funding the range riders. CPW and CDA are also working to offer other non-lethal tools to ranchers.\n\nIn addition to sharing the depredation document on Wednesday, CPW also published its monthly updated map of where the wolves have moved in the past month. The below map illustrates the watersheds where they traveled between March 26 and April 23.\n\nThis appears to be the first map to show that wolves have ventured into Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nFor a watershed to indicate wolf activity, CPW must have data for at least one GPS point from a wolf collar within the watershed boundaries. Just because a watershed is purple in the above map does not mean the animals are present throughout the entire watershed, CPW said.\n\nThe CPW Commission will meet May 1-2 to discuss multiple topics, including changing rules to allow the use of artificial light for wolves causing damage, allowing pooled grazers to apply for wolf permits and compensation, and defining domestic bison as livestock so those livestock owners can be reimbursed when applicable.\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

Polis and officials they call these acts a result of chronic depredation. Other states have defined this as at least three confirmed livestock depredations within 12 months.\n\nHowever, in Colorado, this has not been defined yet. It is small important things that add up to some of his frustration.\n\n\"Why haven't we defined chronic depredation? It's still not defined, and, in our letter, we say this is chronic depredation,\" said Ritschard.\n\nAs time is ticking, the association wants action now as more wolves are set to be released later this year.\n\n\"If you start getting rid of the problem wolves now, you are going to significantly decrease that chance of having more later,\" said Ritschard, \"but, you still can have a surviving wolf pack that'll make it if we get rid of the issues,\" said Ritschard.\n\nCBS News Colorado reached out to CPW and has not received a response. CBS News Colorado also reached out to WildEarth an organization that looks to advocate, restore, and protect wildlife, and is waiting for a response.\n\nCPW and the Department of Agriculture are working to finalize a program to help ranchers.

It read simply, \"May Matters.\" I saw several others on different lawns over the next few days. I thought it was a real estate sign.\n\nAt first, I said \"there's an aggressive new Realtor in town.\" Then I started seeing several other signs for candidates in the upcoming primary. Then the words finally hit home - \"May Matters.\"\n\nOf course, May matters. It is our only real chance to pick who is going to represent us.\n\nI've been shouting for years that elections are won or lost in the primaries. Only 15-20% of the registered voters even turn out in the primaries. That tiny percentage of voters has determined the outcome in every election in Idaho for well over a decade. Only those voters that are truly motivated show up at the polls.\n\nBecome a participant in our society and vote! Become one of the people that enables all women control of their bodies. Be a voter that says \"No\" to the extremists, \"Yes\" to education and access to health care. So yes, May matters. Get out and vote.\n\nImagine chasing a wolf with a snowmobile and running it over. The wolf is disabled, so you take it home to show your family and take pictures. With its mouth muzzled, you then take the still-alive wolf to a bar, for all your friends to see. You then drink beers with your buddies, and shoot videos of the wolf lying disabled, muzzled, and suffering on the floor. Finally, you take the wolf outside, and shoot it dead. This is the story of Cody Roberts of Wyoming.\n\nCody is the new poster child for everything that's wrong with the state management of wolves.\n\nEver since Senator Tester orchestrated the removal of federal protections for gray wolves in 2009, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho have unleashed a barrage of policies that have resulted in the slaughter of wolves numbering in the thousands. Hunting, trapping, and strangulation (snaring) are some of the tactics employed by \"sportsmen.\" Don't forget poisoning, killing wolf pups in their dens, and state-sanctioned aerial gunning and bounties.

You'll soon have a chance in Durham.", "body": "Visitors to Durham's Museum of Life and Science will be able to glimpse the Triangle's rarest puppies starting in late May.\n\nSunday, a female red wolf gave birth to a litter of seven pups -- four males and three females. All seven are in good health, museum officials said in a Wednesday press release.\n\nCaptive breeding is critical to the survival of red wolves, an endangered species. About 270 wolves live in captivity and about 20 wolves live in the wild, on the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in and around Hyde County.\n\n\"As we face challenges in the wild population, institutions within Red Wolf SAFE, like ours, hold a significant responsibility. Each pup born is crucial for the species' survival and offers hope for the broader Red Wolf population,\" Sherry Samuels, the Museum of Life and Science's senior director of animal care, said in the release.\n\nThis week's litter is the first to be born at the museum since 2019, and the sixth ever born there. Previous litters arrived in 1993, 2002, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe breeding pair included Adeyha, a female wolf who was born in 2014 at the New Zoo in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Officials moved Adeyha to Durham in October 2023 to pair with Oak, a male wolf who has been at the facility since 2022. Oak was born in 2019 at the N.C. State University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe puppies are likely to remain at the Museum of Life and Science until they reach breeding age, typically about two and a half years, Ro Rode, a museum spokeswoman, said in an interview.\n\nAt that point, the American Zoo and Aquarium's American Red Wolf Saving Animals From Extinction committee will likely split the wolves up among the 41 partner facilities with the hopes of producing more puppies and making the species as genetically diverse as possible. That's particularly important with red wolves because all of the wolves now alive can be traced to 14 wolves that were captured in the early 1970s.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has considered red wolves extinct in the wild since 1980.\n\nPreviously, red wolves born at the Museum of Life and Science have been sent to the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, New York, and the Mill Mountain Zoo in Roanoke, Virginia. After the 2019 birth in Durham, the entire pack of parents and six puppies was moved to Mill Mountain, with at least some remaining at the Roanoke facility.\n\nFor now, the puppies and their parents are under regular monitoring for their health. The public will be able to see them for the first time starting in late May, though museum officials cautioned the wolves are a little skittish around crowds and loud noises.\n\n\"This summer promises to be filled with excitement as we watch this family grow. Patience and quiet observation will be key when observing our new pups,\" Samuels said in the release.\n\nUniquely NC is a News & Observer subscriber collection of moments, landmarks and personalities

(WOOD) -- A group of Michigan state lawmakers is urging the Department of Natural Resources to use \"common sense\" as it explores whether to bring criminal charges against a hunter who unknowingly killed a gray wolf earlier this year in Calhoun County.\n\nState Rep. Jay DeBoyer, R-Clay, who represents parts of St. Clair and Macomb counties, penned a letter to the agency saying criminal charges won't \"alleviate\" any of the issues that led to the incident.\n\nThe endangered animal was reportedly shot and killed in January. The hunter, who was with a guide and about 300 miles away from any known gray wolf habitat, told the DNR that they thought it was a coyote. However, some experts say it was apparent that the animal was not a coyote. DNR large carnivore specialist Brian Roell told Bridge Michigan that he only needed \"one look at the photos\" to know it wasn't a coyote.\n\n\"As the wolf population has grown, there has been increasing interactions between wolves and human populations -- particularly in rural Upper Peninsula communities where livestock is raised,\" DeBoyer wrote in the letter. \"Punishing Michigan hunters and farmers will not alleviate the issues we are facing. I am hoping common sense and a commitment to solutions will come of this event -- not criminal charges that will impact someone for the rest of their life.\n\nTwenty-five other legislators co-signed DeBoyer's letter to the DNR, including state Reps. Joseph Fox, R-Fremont; Pat Outman, R-Six Lakes; Bryan Posthumus, R-Rockford; and Angela Rigas, R-Alto.\n\nAccording to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, any person who knowingly kills an endangered animal faces up to one year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Gray wolves are only allowed to be legally killed if there is a direct and immediate threat to human life.\n\nDNR data shows virtually no gray wolf activity in Michigan's lower peninsula over the last several decades.\n\nA wolf that had been radio collared was captured and killed in Presque Isle County in October 2004, making it the first wild wolf found in the Lower Peninsula in several decades. Track surveys in 2011 and 2015 found some signs.

Jared Polis and Colorado Parks and Wildlife to kill four wolves blamed for the deaths of six cows in Grand and Jackson counties in the past 16 days.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Polis and CPW on Monday, the Middle Park Stockgrowers Association reiterated a request it sent April 18 for the immediate removal of two wolves from known depredating packs in Oregon that have been killing cattle in Grand County. A letter sent Monday from the North Park Stockgrowers Association said it \"proudly stands united\" with Middle Park and requested additionally that CPW kill two wolves that have been \"plaguing Jackson County\" with 20 confirmed animal deaths since they entered Colorado in 2022 and killed one calf and injured another in the same 16-day period this month.\n\nGrand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin in his letter cited five confirmed deaths in Grand County, adding \"this number of depredations is believed to be higher as our community continues to learn about wolf practices and patterns here firsthand in our county.\"\n\nThe Larimer County Stockgrowers Association, which added its letter to the mix Monday afternoon, wrote to Polis and CPW \"in solidarity with (its) brothers and sisters in animal husbandry from the Middle and North Park Communities.\"\n\n\"The tenuous nature of these now chronic depredation events requires a greater level of communication, transparency

The initiative has gone ahead with 180 votes in favor, 155 votes against (PSOE, Sumar and ERC) and 7 abstentions. The 7 abstentions belong to the Euskal Herria Bildu Group, which has not participated in the debate, and to the Canarian Coalition deputy Cristina Valido, belonging to the Mixed Group. The deputy of the Mixed Group Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos voted against along with PSOE, Sumar and ERC.\n\nThe PP proposal was related to the conservation of the wolf in Spain and its cohabitation with extensive livestock farming and the fight against the demographic challenge and proposed modifying the Royal Decree that develops the List to limit the prohibition of its hunting exclusively in the southern regions. of the Douro River.\n\nThe initiative has been debated a month after a motion was also approved at the request of the Popular Party in the Senate urging the Government to exclude the Lespre wolf, to reduce the protection of the species and to reach a agreement that makes wolf conservation compatible with livestock activities.\n\nIn the debate, the PP has exposed the incompatibility of the coexistence of the wolf with livestock farmers, the request for the elimination of the Lespre wolf and the accusations against the Government of regulations that are too protectionist and not in line with European ones.\n\nThe popular Silverio Arg\u00fcelles has requested the exclusion of the wolf from Lespre and has pointed out that in Europe the status of the wolf has not changed, \"it has only done so in Spain\" where it was brought under the protection of the European Habitats Directive.\n\nThe status proposed by the PP was in line with the autonomies, because \"the powers on this issue are theirs,\" he stated, while accusing the Government of \"having changed the situation through a lie about the extinction of the wolf.\" of the wolf to the north and south of the Duero River\", and has pointed out that the ranchers who do not want compensation, only want to make a living from livestock, are being \"put under the ropes.\"\n\nHe has assured that it is communities like Cantabria, Galicia and others that are \"giving subsidies for the protection of their livestock farms,\" because \"there are on average 35 attacks a day, with the loss of more than a million animals since the approval of the wolf protection law.\"\n\n\"The impact of their measures is also destroying the agri-food industry,\" he assured. And he has urged the Government to make the Common Agrarian Policy (CAP) and environmental laws more flexible, reduce bureaucracy, lower the tax on plastic, while \"the PP seeks to return the wolf to the status it always had.\"\n\nThe socialist deputy Daniel Senderos has accused the popular party of presenting \"again a proposal that has already been presented in different committees of Congress and the Senate\" and has asked the popular bench \"if it has new approaches, because the wolf's first strategy It was done in 2005 and should be reviewed in 2020 with PP governments, but the PSOE government has done it.\"\n\nThe socialist has explained that the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge \"has not taken away the powers of the autonomous communities\" and has stated that the PSOE defends the balance in the ecosystems in which there is a presence of the wolf and the coexistence of the this animal and livestock.\n\nIsidre Gav\u00edn i Valls (Junts) has assured that his training defends the protection of threatened species, but is also \"favorable to the preservation of human activity in the natural environment.\"\n\nJosebe Aginetxea (PNV) has stressed that his party does not \"engage in partisan wars\", which is why he voted in favor of the initiative \"by sticking\" to the text of the proposal and because \"the management of the wolf has not been done well\" and the inclusion in the Lespre \"has not solved the problem that is being experienced between the wolf and livestock.\"\n\nJulia Boada Dan\u00e9s (Sumar) has defended the strategy in force until now, on which she has stressed that \"there is consensus from a technical point of view that the preventive measures usually available are effective when they are globally and adequately executed.\"\n\nBoada Dan\u00e9s also recalled the existing prevention measures, such as that \"Miteco transfers to the autonomous communities an annual fund of 20 million euros to finance prevention measures and compensation\"; Even so, he has admitted that \"it is necessary to reinforce social mediation measures.\"\n\nThus, the representative for Sumar has stated that \"the wolf is key to the balance of our ecosystems, as is key to establishing adequate prevention and compensation measures to guarantee balance.\"\n\n\u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez Maraver (VOX) has emphasized his group's position for years about the tremendous mistake of including the wolf on the list of protected species and how it could ruin \"thousands of ranchers.\"\n\nAs he stated, \"adequate hunting control based on a national wolf management plan is the best tool to maintain a balance.\"", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [],

Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, head of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, is seeking a second term, running against Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez. The two ran on the same ticket four years ago, but Gonz\u00e1lez announced her plan to challenge Pierluisi in early December. Public jabs between the two have since turned acrimonious. Running alongside Pierluisi for the position of congressional representative is Puerto Rico Sen. William Villafa\u00f1e, while senior U.S. naval military officer Elmer Rom\u00e1n, a former secretary of state for Puerto Rico, is seeking the position under Gonz\u00e1lez. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Sen. Juan Zaragoza, who was highly lauded for his work as the island\u2019s former treasury secretary, is running against Rep. Jes\u00fas Manuel Ortiz to be the main candidate for the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s status quo as a U.S. territory. Attorney Pablo Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez is running unopposed to be the party\u2019s candidate for resident commissioner, the first person in 20 years to seek that nomination. All candidates face disgruntled voters on an island still struggling with chronic power outages and high electric bills as it awaits completion of reconstruction projects following Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in September 2017. Power outages remain such a big concern that the State Commission of Elections rented more than a dozen generators and a private power company identified 81 alternate voting sites with guaranteed electricity. Other voter complaints include the difficulty of obtaining business permits, a fractured education system, and the island\u2019s lack of access to capital markets after the local government emerged two years ago from the largest debt restructuring in U.S. history. Meanwhile, more than $9 billion of debt owed by Puerto Rico\u2019s power company, the largest of any government agency, remains unresolved. A federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process has yet to rule on a restructuring plan following bitter negotiations between the government and bondholders. Ahead of the primaries, Pierluisi has touted record tourist numbers, ongoing hurricane reconstruction and growing economic development among his successes as he seeks re-election. He has pledged to prioritize projects targeting children and the island\u2019s growing elderly population, among other things. An event marking the end of his campaign held a week before the primaries was headlined by former Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, who resigned in August 2019 following nearly two weeks of massive protests touched off by a leak of crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top advisers. His opponent, Gonz\u00e1lez, did not hold a campaign closer. She has pledged to crack down on corruption, award more funds to agencies to help victims of violence amid a surge in killings of women, and stem an exodus of doctors and other medical workers to the U.S. mainland. Meanwhile, Zaragoza has promised to prioritize climate change and renewable energy, decentralize the island\u2019s education department and improve access to health. His opponent, Ortiz, has pledged to improve the licensing process to retain doctors, simplify the island\u2019s tax system and revamp health care. Puerto Rico\u2019s next governor will have to work alongside a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances and was created after the government declared bankruptcy. Ahead of Sunday\u2019s primaries, more than 4,900 inmates voted in prisons across the U.S. territory. The State Commission of Elections also has received and counted more than 122,000 early ballots.

Beryl's center is expected to pass about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Barbados on Monday morning, said Sabu Best, director of Barbados' meteorological service.\n\n\"This is a very serious situation developing for the Windward Islands,\" warned the National Hurricane Center in Miami, which said that Beryl was \"forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge.\"\n\nThis National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite image taken at 4:20pm EDT shows hurricane Beryl, lower center right, as it strengthens over the Atlantic Ocean and churns toward the southeast Caribbean on Saturday, June 29, 2024.

It was a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph). It was expected to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by midweek but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher. Lowry said the waters are now warmer than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J.

Beryl's centre is expected to pass about 112 kilometres south of Barbados on Monday morning, said Sabu Best, director of Barbados' meteorological service.\n\n\"This is a very serious situation developing for the Windward Islands,\" warned the National Hurricane Center in Miami, which said that Beryl was \"forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge.\"\n\nBeryl strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane on Sunday morning, becoming the first major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles on record for June, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.\n\nBeryl is now only the third Category 3 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in June, following Audrey in 1957 and Alma in 1966, said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry.\n\n\"Beryl is an extremely dangerous and rare hurricane for this time of year in this area,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Unusual is an understatement.

It was a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 185 kph and was moving west at 33 kph. It was expected to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by midweek but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 3 meters in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 15 centimetres of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fuelling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher. Lowry said the waters are now warmer than they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J.

Beryl's center is expected to pass about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Barbados on Monday morning, said Sabu Best, director of Barbados' meteorological service.\n\n\"This is a very serious situation developing for the Windward Islands,\" warned the National Hurricane Center in Miami, which said that Beryl was \"forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge.\"\n\nBeryl strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane on Sunday morning, becoming the first major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles on record for June, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.\n\nBeryl is now only the third Category 3 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in June, following Audrey in 1957 and Alma in 1966, said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry.\n\n\"Beryl is an extremely dangerous and rare hurricane for this time of year in this area,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Unusual is an understatement. Beryl is already a historic hurricane and it hasn't struck yet.\"\n\nHurricane Ivan in 2004 was the last strongest hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean, causing catastrophic damage in Grenada as a Category 3 storm.\n\n\"So this is a serious threat, a very serious threat,\" Lowry said of Beryl.\n\nBeryl was located about 420 miles (675 kilometers) east-southeast of Barbados. It was a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph). It was expected to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by midweek but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher. Lowry said the waters are now warmer than what they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.

Some households were already boarding up their properties.\n\nA Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane, and a Category 4 storm packs sustained winds of at least 130 miles per hour (209 kilometers per hour).\n\nThe NHC said that by around 5:00 am (0900 GMT) Sunday, Beryl's maximum sustained winds had increased to nearly 100 mph, with higher gusts.\n\nSuch a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season -- which runs from early June to late November -- is extremely rare, experts said.\n\n\"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July. Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic,\" hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.\n\n\"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday,\" the NHC said, warning of heavy rain, flooding and storm surge that could raise water levels as much as nine feet (2.7 meters) above normal.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC said, indicating wind speeds in some locations could be 30 percent stronger than those listed in their advisory.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an \"extraordinary\" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.\n\nThe agency cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.\n\nExtreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.\n\nbur-st-mlm/rsc/smw", "source": {"uri":

It was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J.

Beryl's center is expected to pass about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Barbados on Monday morning, said Sabu Best, director of Barbados' meteorological service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is a very serious situation developing for the Windward Islands,\" warned the National Hurricane Center in Miami, which said that Beryl was \"forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeryl strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane on Sunday morning, becoming the first major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles on record for June, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.\n\nD-FW Weather Wise\n\nFrom snow to 100-degree heat, we've got you covered.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBeryl is now only the third Category 3 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in June, following Audrey in 1957 and Alma in 1966, said hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Beryl is an extremely dangerous and rare hurricane for this time of year in this area,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Unusual is an understatement. Beryl is already a historic hurricane and it hasn't struck yet.\"\n\nHurricane Ivan in 2004 was the last strongest hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean, causing catastrophic damage in Grenada as a Category 3 storm.\n\n\"So this is a serious threat, a very serious threat,\" Lowry said of Beryl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeryl was located about 420 miles (675 kilometers) east-southeast of Barbados. It was a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph). It was expected to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by midweek but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher. Lowry said the waters are now warmer than what they would be at the peak of hurricane season in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nRelated StoriesRead MoreBeryl becomes 1st major hurricane this season, churns toward southeast CaribbeanA major hurricane is considered a Category 3 or higher, with winds of at least

Tropical storm warnings are in effect for Martinique and Tobago, while a stormical storm watch is in effect in Dominica.\n\n\"This is a very serious situation developing for the Windward Islands,\" warned the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.

Alma hit the Florida Keys on June 8, 1966, according to Weather Underground.\n\n\"It's astonishing to see a forecast for a major hurricane in June anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics. #Beryl organizing in a hurry over the warmest waters ever recorded for late June,\" Florida-based hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is predicted to be a busy hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Last week, Tropical Storm Alberto brought torrential flooding to portions of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. It was responsible for at least four deaths in the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon and Veracruz.\n\nAccording to CBS News weather producer David Parkinson, Beryl is the farthest east a hurricane has formed in June, and one of only two to do so east of the Caribbean, with the other instance occurring in 1933. Parkinson expects Beryl to remain south of Jamaica, and forecasts that any U.S. impacts are still at least eight days away.\n\nWarm waters are fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nForecasters warned of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\n\"We need to be ready,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Friday. \"You and I know when these things happen, it is better to plan for the worst and pray for the best.\"\n\nShe noted that thousands of people were in Barbados Saturday for the Twenty20 World Cup cricket final, with India beating South Africa on Saturday in the capital of Bridgetown. It is considered cricket's biggest event.\n\nMeanwhile, St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a public address Saturday that shelters will open Sunday evening as he urged people to prepare. He ordered officials to refuel government vehicles and asked grocery stores and gas stations to stay open later before the storm.\n\n\"There will be such a rush ...if you keep limited hours,\" he said as he apologized ahead of time for government interruptions on radio stations with storm updates. \"Cricket lovers have to bear with us that we'll have to give information ... this is life and death.\"\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, the season's first hurricane usually forms in early to mid-August, which makes Beryl unusual for having reached hurricane strength. In a report released last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an \"above average\" hurricane season with 17 to 25 storms, 8 to 13 hurricanes and 4 to 7 major hurricanes of category 3 or higher. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nA tropical storm is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73

Some households were already boarding up their properties.\n\nA major hurricane is considered a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds of at least 179 kmh.\n\nSuch a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season - which runs from early June to late November - is extremely rare, experts said.\n\n\"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July. Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic,\" hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.\n\nThe NHC said that as of 2am on Sunday, Beryl's maximum sustained winds had increased to nearly 145 kmh with higher gusts.\n\n\"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday,\" it said, warning of heavy rain, flooding and storm surge that could raise water levels as much as 2.1m above normal.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC said, indicating wind speeds in some locations could be 30 per cent stronger than those listed in their advisory.\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson wind scale designates Category 1 hurricanes as having wind speeds of at least 119 kmh, up to Category 5 storms with winds of 253 kmh or higher.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an \"extraordinary\" hurricane season with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.\n\nThe agency cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.\n\nExtreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.",

It was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Centre.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 metres) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms.

Some households were already boarding up their properties.\n\nA Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale is considered a major hurricane, and a Category 4 storm packs sustained winds of at least 130 miles per hour (209 kilometers per hour).\n\nThe NHC said that by around 5:00 am (0900 GMT) Sunday, Beryl's maximum sustained winds had increased to nearly 100 mph, with higher gusts.\n\nSuch a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season -- which runs from early June to late November -- is extremely rare, experts said.\n\nMore from this section Gymnast Jones eyes Paris berth with injury flare-up behind her AI reveals Antarctic ice shelves melting faster than thought TSA screens record number of people, surge expected to continue\n\n\"Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July. Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic,\" hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.\n\n\"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday,\" the NHC said, warning of heavy rain, flooding and storm surge that could raise water levels as much as nine feet (2.7 meters) above normal.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC said, indicating wind speeds in some locations could be 30 percent stronger than those listed in their advisory.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in late May that it expects this year to be an \"extraordinary\" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.\n\nThe agency cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.\n\nExtreme weather events including hurricanes have become more frequent and more devastating in recent years as a result of climate change.\n\nbur-st-mlm/rsc/smw", "source": {"uri":

CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa reports.\n\n(CNN) -- Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, is rapidly intensifying as it churns towards Barbados and the Windward Islands, promising destructive hurricane-force winds and life-threatening storm surge.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Beryl is expected to be an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 hurricane when it reaches the Windward Islands by late Sunday or early Monday. The early timing of the season's first hurricane is unusual, given the average date for the first hurricane is August 11.\n\nHurricane Beryl, now a Category 2 storm, is about 465 miles east-southeast of Barbados and packing maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, the hurricane center said in its 5 a.m. ET update. It's expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge starting Sunday night.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC said. \"A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane warning and watch areas.\"\n\nMore accurate data on the storm's intensity is expected once aircraft conduct direct observations Sunday.\n\nThe hurricane is strengthening quickly, with its winds increasing from 35 mph to 75 mph in less than 24 hours. Rapid intensification is defined as a wind increase of 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period.\n\n\"We're forecasting rapid intensification and expecting Beryl to become a major hurricane before it reaches places like Barbados and the Windward islands and continue to be a powerful hurricane as it moves into the eastern and central Caribbean as we go into the early portions of next week,\" Mike Brennan, Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield Saturday.\n\nThe storm is now just 11 mph shy of reaching \"major\" hurricane status - a Category 3 or higher that has potential for \"significant loss of life and damage.\"\n\nResidents in places with hurricane warnings should be prepared for major storm impacts, Brennan said. Beryl brings a risk of heavy rainfall, destructive hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches could bring localized flooding across the Windward Islands Sunday night and Monday, according to the center.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for Barbados, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, and Grenada. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Martinique and Tobago, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Dominica.\n\n\"Interests in the central and western Carribean should monitor the progress of this system,\" warned the NHC Saturday.\n\nThe first hurricane of the season is unusually early\n\nBeryl's rapid intensification is very unusual this early into hurricane season, according to Brennan. It's rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, with only a handful having done so, according to NOAA records.\n\nIf Beryl reaches Category 4 intensity before Thursday July 4, it would be the earliest recorded Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic. The storm has already set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933.\n\nThe central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems.\n\nThis year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development.\n\n\"Beryl has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\" Brennan said.\n\nWarmer waters in the Atlantic Basin have given tropical storms and hurricanes the opportunity to develop at a more rapid pace in an more eastward position, according to Brennan, allowing storms to become more powerful and therefore more destructive earlier on in hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30.\n\n\"These are ocean water you'd normally see like in August or September, but now we're seeing them in late June,\" Brennan said. \"It's kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\"\n\nCaribbean islands urge public to prepare ahead of hurricane\n\nAuthorities are urging residents to take precautionary measures, with several Caribbean nations under hurricane watches and warnings while Hurricane Beryl approaches and gains strength.\n\nOfficials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \"hazardous\" marine conditions and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities.\n\n\"All the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\" Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a statement. \"We have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\"\n\nIn Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches.\n\n\"Kingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\" Gonsalves said of the capital city. \"Normally, two inches of rain - sustained rain - in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\"\n\nIn Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \"moderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\" to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans.\n\nIn Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located.\n\nNOAA predicts above-normal hurricane season\n\nSystems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to research from Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. Normally, ocean temperatures aren't warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive.\n\nNational Weather Service forecasters predict 17 to 25 named storms this season, with eight to 13 of those becoming hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes.\n\n\"That's well above average,\" Brennan noted.\n\nThe weather service says thats's \"due to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Some households were already boarding up their properties.\n\nBeryl is now only the third Category 3 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in June, following Audrey in 1957 and Alma in 1966, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry.\n\n\"Only five major [Category 3+] hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July.

Such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season - which runs from early June to late November - is extremely rare, experts said.\n\n\"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday,\" the NHC said, warning of heavy rain, flooding and storm surge that could raise water levels as much as 9 feet (2.7 metres) above normal.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC added, indicating wind speeds in some locations could be 30 percent stronger than those listed in their advisory.\n\nBeryl is likely to pass just south of Barbados early on Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path towards Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by midweek but remain a hurricane as it heads towards Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of a life-threatening storm surge in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (150mm) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in late May that it expects this year to be an \"extraordinary\" hurricane season, with up to seven storms of Category 3 or higher.\n\nThe agency cited warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and conditions related to the weather phenomenon La Nina in the Pacific for the expected

It was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic.

The early timing of the season's first hurricane is unusual, given the average date for the first hurricane is August 11.\n\nHurricane Beryl, now a Category 2 storm, is about 465 miles east-southeast of Barbados and packing maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, the hurricane center said in its 5 a.m. ET update. It's expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge starting Sunday night.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC said. \"A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane warning and watch areas.\"\n\nMore accurate data on the storm's intensity is expected once aircraft conduct direct observations Sunday.\n\nThe hurricane is strengthening quickly, with its winds increasing from 35 mph to 75 mph in less than 24 hours. Rapid intensification is defined as a wind increase of 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period.\n\n\"We're forecasting rapid intensification and expecting Beryl to become a major hurricane before it reaches places like Barbados and the Windward islands and continue to be a powerful hurricane as it moves into the eastern and central Caribbean as we go into the early portions of next week,\" Mike Brennan, Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield Saturday.\n\nThe storm is now just 11 mph shy of reaching \"major\" hurricane status - a Category 3 or higher that has potential for \"significant loss of life and damage.\"\n\nResidents in places with hurricane warnings should be prepared for major storm impacts, Brennan said. Beryl brings a risk of heavy rainfall, destructive hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches could bring localized flooding across the Windward Islands Sunday night and Monday, according to the center.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for Barbados, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, and Grenada. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Martinique and Tobago, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Dominica.\n\n\"Interests in the central and western Carribean should monitor the progress of this system,\" warned the NHC Saturday.\n\nBeryl's rapid intensification is very unusual this early into hurricane season, according to Brennan. It's rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, with only a handful having done so, according to NOAA records.\n\nIf Beryl reaches Category 4 intensity before Thursday July 4, it would be the earliest recorded Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic. The storm has already set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933.\n\nThe central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems.\n\nThis year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development.\n\n\"Beryl has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\" Brennan said.\n\nWarmer waters in the Atlantic Basin have given tropical storms and hurricanes the opportunity to develop at a more rapid pace in an more eastward position, according to Brennan, allowing storms to become more powerful and therefore more destructive earlier on in hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30.\n\n\"These are ocean water you'd normally see like in August or September, but now we're seeing them in late June,\" Brennan said. \"It's kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\"\n\nAuthorities are urging residents to take precautionary measures, with several Caribbean nations under hurricane watches and warnings while Hurricane Beryl approaches and gains strength.\n\nOfficials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \"hazardous\" marine conditions and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities.\n\n\"All the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\" Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a statement. \"We have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\"\n\nIn Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches.\n\n\"Kingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\" Gonsalves said of the capital city. \"Normally, two inches of rain - sustained rain - in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\"\n\nIn Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \"moderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\" to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans.\n\nIn Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located.\n\nSystems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to research from Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. Normally, ocean temperatures aren't warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive.\n\nNational Weather Service forecasters predict 17 to 25 named storms this season, with eight to 13 of those becoming hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes.\n\n\"That's well above average,\" Brennan noted.\n\nThe weather service says thats's \"due to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms.

Officials urge residents to seek shelter due to potential life-threatening conditions. The storm's rapid intensification has set several records, causing widespread panic and preparations.\n\nHurricane Beryl is forecast to strengthen into a powerful Category 4 storm as it approaches the southeast Caribbean, which began shutting down Sunday amid urgent pleads from government officials for people to take shelter.\n\nHurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre in Miami issued a stark warning about the impending danger, describing Beryl as an \"extremely dangerous hurricane\" capable of bringing life-threatening winds and storm surge. Beryl intensified to a Category 3 hurricane on Sunday, marking it as the first major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles in June, according to Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University.\n\nBeryl stands as only the third Category 3 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic in June, following Audrey in 1957 and Alma in 1966, according to hurricane expert Michael Lowry. The storm was situated about 465 miles (750 kilometers) east-southeast of Barbados, possessing sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and traveling westward at 21 mph (33 kph). Hurricane hunters have been dispatched to collect data on its intensity, per the National Hurricane Centre.\n\nThe storm is anticipated to pass just south of Barbados early Monday, advancing into the Caribbean Sea as a formidable hurricane. Although weakening is expected mid-week, Beryl is forecast to maintain hurricane status as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters project life-threatening storm surge reaching up to 9 feet (3 meters) with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and neighboring islands.\n\nIn preparation, long lines have formed at gas stations and grocery stores as residents brace for the record-breaking and rapidly intensifying storm, transforming from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday.\n\nBrian McNoldy of the University of Miami highlighted that the unusually warm waters, with the highest recorded ocean heat content for this time of year in the deep Atlantic, are fueling Beryl.\n\nBreaking a 1933 record, Beryl is the farthest east a June hurricane has ever formed in the tropical Atlantic, according to Klotzbach. Should Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm for the Atlantic, surpassing Audrey in 1957.\n\nIf Beryl climbs to Category 3 status, it would become only the third such storm in the Caribbean before August, following Dennis and Emily in July 2005, Klotzbach noted.\n\nBarbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley urged vigilance in a public address Saturday, aiming to avoid risks to lives. The Twenty20 World Cup final had drawn thousands to Barbados, adding urgency to the preparations. Mottley emphasized plans to manage the safety of the visitors, particularly those unaccustomed to hurricanes. She announced the closure of businesses and the airport by Sunday evening.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group addressing homelessness, took to social media to warn against complacency among those without homes, stressing the storm's danger and encouraging the use of shelters.\n\nMinister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams echoed these sentiments, rallying Barbadians to help vulnerable individuals. Similarly, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre declared a national shutdown and extended school and business closures to Monday, asserting the priority is life preservation.\n\nCaribbean leaders are also monitoring a cluster of thunderstorms trailing Beryl with a potential to develop into a tropical depression.\n\nMottley cautioned, \"Do not let your guard down.\"\n\nBeryl is the season's second named storm in an expected above-average hurricane season, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts to include up to 25 named storms, 13 hurricanes, and four major hurricanes, surpassing the average of 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Antilles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lesser Antilles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane hunters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Mottley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mia Mottley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean heat content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Abrahams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilfred Abrahams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Pierre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip J.

At midafternoon Saturday, Beryl was a Category 1 hurricane, marking the farthest east that a hurricane formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher.\n\nA hurricane warning was issued for Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. A tropical storm warning was posted for Martinique and Tobago and a tropical storm watch for Dominica.\n\n\"It's astonishing to see a forecast for a major (Category 3+) hurricane in June anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics. #Beryl organizing in a hurry over the warmest waters ever recorded for late June,\" Florida-based hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.\n\nBeryl's center was forecast to pass about 26 miles south of Barbados, said Sabu Best, director of the island's meteorological service. Forecasters then expected the storm to cross the Caribbean on a path toward Jamaica and eventually Mexico.\n\nOn Saturday night, Beryl was centered about 660 miles east-southeast of Barbados, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. It was moving west at 22 mph.\n\n\"Rapid strengthening is now forecast,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAtmospheric science researcher Tomer Burg noted that Beryl was just a tropical depression with 35 mph winds Friday.\n\n\"This means that according to preliminary data, Beryl already met rapid intensification criteria before even becoming a hurricane,\" he wrote on X.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl also is the strongest June tropical storm on record that far east in the tropical Atlantic, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We need to be ready,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Friday. \"You and I know when these things happen, it is better to plan for the worst and pray for the best.\"\n\nShe noted that thousands of people are in Barbados for the Twenty20 World Cup cricket final, with India and South Africa playing in the capital, Bridgetown, on Saturday. It is considered cricket's biggest event.\n\nMeanwhile, St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a public address Saturday that shelters will open Sunday evening as he urged people to prepare. He ordered officials to refuel government vehicles and asked grocery stores and gas stations to stay open later before the storm.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in the hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic.\n\nLowry noted that only five named storms on record have formed in the tropical Atlantic east of the Caribbean. Of those, only one hurricane of record has formed east of the Caribbean in June.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBeryl was expected to drop up to 6 inches of rain in Barbados and nearby islands, and a high surf warning of waves up to 13 feet was in effect. A storm surge of up to 7 feet is also forecast.", "source": {"uri": "nwaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The early timing of the season's first hurricane is unusual, given the average date for the first hurricane is August 11.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. ET, Beryl was about 420 miles east-southeast of Barbados, heading west with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour, the center said in an advisory.\n\n\"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC said. Additionally, a \"life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane warning area.\"\n\nMore accurate data on the storm's intensity is expected once aircraft conduct direct observations Sunday.\n\nThe hurricane is strengthening quickly, with its winds increasing from 35 mph to 75 mph in less than 24 hours. Rapid intensification is defined as a wind increase of 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period.\n\n\"We're forecasting rapid intensification and expecting Beryl to become a major hurricane before it reaches places like Barbados and the Windward islands and continue to be a powerful hurricane as it moves into the eastern and central Caribbean as we go into the early portions of next week,\" Mike Brennan, Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield Saturday.\n\nResidents in places with hurricane warnings should be prepared for major storm impacts, Brennan said. Beryl brings a risk of heavy rainfall, destructive hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches could bring localized flooding across the Windward Islands Sunday night and Monday, according to the center.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, Grenada and Tobago. A tropical storm warning has been issued for Martinique, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Dominica.\n\nBeryl's rapid intensification is very unusual this early into hurricane season, according to Brennan. It's rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, with only a handful having done so, according to NOAA records.\n\nIf Beryl reaches Category 4 intensity before Thursday, July 4, it would be the earliest recorded Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic. The storm has already set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933.\n\nThe central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems.\n\nThis year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development.\n\n\"Beryl has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\" Brennan said.\n\nWarmer waters in the Atlantic Basin have given tropical storms and hurricanes the opportunity to develop at a more rapid pace in an more eastward position, according to Brennan, allowing storms to become more powerful and therefore more destructive earlier on in hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30.\n\n\"These are ocean water you'd normally see like in August or September, but now we're seeing them in late June,\" Brennan said. \"It's kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\"\n\nAuthorities are urging residents to take precautionary measures, with several Caribbean nations under hurricane watches and warnings while Hurricane Beryl approaches and gains strength.\n\nOfficials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \"hazardous\" marine conditions and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities.\n\n\"All the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\" Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a statement. \"We have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\"\n\nIn Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches.\n\n\"Kingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\" Gonsalves said of the capital city. \"Normally, two inches of rain - sustained rain - in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\"\n\nIn Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \"moderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\" to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans.\n\nIn Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located.\n\nSystems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to research from Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. Normally, ocean temperatures aren't warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive.\n\nNational Weather Service forecasters predict 17 to 25 named storms this season, with eight to 13 of those becoming hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes.\n\n\"That's well above average,\" Brennan noted.\n\nThe weather service says that's \"due to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The storm could strengthen into the year's first hurricane before it reaches the Caribbean Sea early next week.\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl is forecast to strengthen into a powerful Category 4 storm as it approaches the southeast Caribbean, which began shutting down Sunday amid urgent pleads from government officials for people to take shelter.\n\nHurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\n\"This is a very serious situation developing for the Windward Islands,\" warned the National Hurricane Center in Miami, which said that Beryl was \"forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge ... as an extremely dangerous hurricane.\"\n\nEarly Sunday morning, Beryl was located about 465 miles (750 kilometers) east-southeast of Barbados. It was a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica and eventually Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "danica_coto@wboc.com", "name": "D\u00e1nica Coto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane hunters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Mottley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mia Mottley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windward Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Juan, Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Juan, Puerto Rico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Atlantic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean heat content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Pierre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip J.

It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Juan, Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Juan, Puerto Rico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane hunters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Mottley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mia Mottley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windward Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Atlantic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean heat content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Pierre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip J.

The hurricane center said hurricane-force winds extended out only 15 miles from the center of the storm on Sunday. Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward up to 80 miles.\n\nBeryl could bring a devastating 6- to 9-foot storm surge to the Windward Islands.

It was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nThis National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite image taken at 4:20pm EDT shows hurricane Beryl, lower center right, as it strengthens over the Atlantic Ocean and churns toward the southeast Caribbean on Saturday, June 29, 2024. (NOAA via AP)\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl\u00b4s winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody\u00b4s life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday\u00b4s Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket\u00b4s biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they\u00b4ve done it before.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother\u00b4s keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nThis National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite image taken at 4:50pm EDT shows hurricane Beryl as it strengthens over the Atlantic Ocean and churns toward the southeast Caribbean on Saturday, June 29, 2024.

The islands of Martinique, Dominica and Tobago were under a tropical storm watch.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected in the specified area within 36 hours and that people should complete all storm preparations, including evacuations if directed by local officials. A hurricane watch indicates that hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours and that residents should prepare to act.\n\nForecasters predicted Beryl would hit Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on Monday, with damaging winds preceding it likely to reach the capital, Kingstown, at 8 a.m. local time.\n\nSome computer weather models suggest that the storm could intensify into a major hurricane, which is a Category 3 or higher.\n\nAccording to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records, only three storms have reached Category 3 status in the north Atlantic Ocean this early in the season: Alma in 1966, Audrey in 1957 and an unnamed storm in 1916.\n\nAll made landfall on the U.S. coastline in the Gulf of Mexico: Alma near St. Marks, Florida; Audrey near Port Arthur, Texas; and the 1916 storm near Mobile, Alabama.\n\nThe system became Tropical Storm Beryl late Friday when its sustained winds reached 39 mph. At 74 mph, a storm becomes a hurricane.\n\nA named storm this far east in the Atlantic is unusual for June, John Cangialosi, a forecaster with the National Hurricane Center, wrote in an advisory Friday.\n\n\"There have only been a few storms in history that have formed over the central or eastern tropical Atlantic this early in the year,\" he wrote.\n\nHere are key things to know about the storm.\n\n-- Swells created by Beryl are expected to reach the Windward and southern Leeward Islands by late Sunday, forecasters said, and likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\n-- The storm is expected to cross the islands of the eastern Caribbean as early as Sunday night before traversing the central Caribbean Sea through the middle of next week.\n\n-- Between 3 to 6 inches of rain, hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge are possible in the eastern Caribbean Islands, including Barbados, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines Sunday into Monday.\n\n-- There is a fair amount of uncertainty in the forecast about the track the storm will take, especially beyond three days.\n\nForecasters have warned that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could be much more active than usual.\n\nIn late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted 17 to 25 named storms this year, an \"above-normal\" number and a prediction in line with more than a dozen forecasts earlier in the year from experts at universities, private companies and government agencies.\n\nHurricane seasons produce 14 named storms on average.",

Hurricane warnings are in effect for several islands, including Barbados, St.Lucia, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami has emphasized the severity of the situation, stating that Beryl is \"forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge ... as an extremely dangerous hurricane.\" Beryl's rapid intensification has made it a record-breaking storm, becoming the first major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles in June and only the third Category 3 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic during this month.\n\nAs Beryl continues its path towards the Caribbean Sea, it is expected to pass just south of Barbados early Monday before heading towards Jamaica as a major hurricane. Forecasters have warned of life-threatening storm surges up to 9 feet in areas where Beryl will make landfall, along with heavy rainfall for Barbados and nearby islands. The storm is expected to weaken by mid-week but remain a hurricane as it approaches Mexico.\n\nCaribbean leaders are urging their citizens to take shelter and prepare for the storm. Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley has called for all businesses to close by Sunday evening and warned that the airport will shut down by nighttime. St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre has announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening, with schools and businesses remaining closed on Monday. Authorities are also concerned about the safety of homeless individuals and are working to direct them to shelters.\n\nIn addition to Beryl, Caribbean leaders are also preparing for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane, which have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.

It was a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was moving west at 21 mph (33 kph).\n\nTwo hurricane hunters were en route to the storm to gather more details about its intensity, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBeryl is expect to pass just south of Barbados early Monday and then head into the Caribbean Sea as a major hurricane on a path toward Jamaica. It is expected to weaken by mid-week but still remain a hurricane as it heads toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of life-threatening storm surge of up to 9 feet (3 meters) in areas where Beryl will make landfall, with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain for Barbados and nearby islands.\n\nLong lines formed at gas stations and grocery stores in Barbados and other islands as people rushed to prepare for a storm that has broken records and rapidly intensified from a tropical storm with 35 mph winds on Friday to a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday.\n\nWarm waters were fueling Beryl, with ocean heat content in the deep Atlantic the highest on record for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, University of Miami tropical meteorology researcher.\n\nBeryl marks the farthest east that a hurricane has formed in the tropical Atlantic in June, breaking a record set in 1933, according to Philip Klotzbach, Colorado State University hurricane researcher. If Beryl's winds reach 125 mph, it would be the second earliest such storm in the Atlantic on record, surpassing Audrey in 1957, he said.\n\nIn addition, if Beryl reaches a Category 3, it would only be the third storm to do so in the Caribbean prior to August; Dennis and Emily both did so in July of 2005, according to Klotzbach.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a public address late Saturday. \"We do not want to put anybody's life at risk.\"\n\nThousands of people were in Barbados for Saturday's Twenty20 World Cup final, cricket's biggest event, with Mottley noting that not all fans were able to leave Sunday despite many rushing to change their flights.\n\n\"Some of them have never gone through a storm before,\" she said. \"We have plans to take care of them.\"\n\nMottley said all businesses should close by Sunday evening and warned the airport would close by nighttime.\n\nKemar Saffrey, president of a Barbadian group that aims to end homelessness, said in a video posted on social media Saturday night that those without homes tend to think they can ride out storms because they've done it before.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the approach that they take,\" he said, warning that Beryl is a dangerous storm and urging Barbadians to direct homeless people to a shelter.\n\nEchoing his comments was Wilfred Abrahams, minister of home affairs and information.\n\n\"I need Barbadians at this point to be their brother's keeper,\" he said. \"Some people are vulnerable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, St. Lucia Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced a national shutdown for Sunday evening and said schools and businesses would remain closed on Monday.\n\n\"Preservation and protection of life is a priority,\" he said.\n\nCaribbean leaders were preparing not only for Beryl, but for a cluster of thunderstorms trailing the hurricane that have a 70% chance of becoming a tropical depression.\n\n\"Do not let your guard down,\" Mottley said.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in what is forecast to be an above-average hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. Earlier this month, Tropical Storm Alberto came ashore in northeastern Mexico with heavy rains that resulted in four deaths.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms.

The government has updated its travel advice for nine Caribbean destinations favoured by UK holidaymakers, as an imminent hurricane warning is declared, set to lash the islands.\n\nThe Foreign Office's most recent update on its website singles out those planning trips to St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Barbados, Dominica, St Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda with a clear message: \"The hurricane season runs from June to November.

As of Saturday, Beryl was moving towards the southeast Caribbean, classified as a 'big storm' with winds expected to surpass 111 mph (178 kph), indicating a category 3 hurricane or higher.\n\nBeryl is on track to become the second major hurricane of the season, which runs from June 1 to November 30 in the Atlantic. The eye of Hurricane Beryl is predicted to pass a mere 26 miles south of Barbados, according to Sabu Best, head of the island's meteorological services.\n\nWith wind gusts reaching up to 65 mph, Beryl was pinpointed around 785 miles southeast of Barbados on Saturday. The hurricane is advancing westward at a pace of 23 mph, as per reports by the Express, reports the Mirror.\n\nHurricane warnings have been declared for Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada, and St Vincent and the Grenadines, while Martinique, Dominica, and Tobago are on alert for a tropical storm. Michael Lowry, a Florida-based hurricane specialist, commented on X: \"It's astonishing to see a forecast for a major (Category 3+) hurricane in June anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics. #Beryl organising in a hurry over the warmest waters ever recorded for late June.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Beryl was tracked about 720 miles east-southeast of Barbados, with maximum sustained winds of 75mph, moving west at 22mph. \"Rapid strengthening is now forecast,\" announced the National Hurricane Centre in Miami.\n\nWarm ocean water is fuelling Beryl, with the heat content in the deep Atlantic hitting record highs for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, a tropical meteorology specialist at the University of Miami.\n\nBeryl has been noted as the most potent June tropical storm in that part of the tropical Atlantic, says Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University.\n\n\"We need to be ready,\" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley

The steady windspeed increases have come after the hurricane center -- saying Beryl was \"rapidly intensifying\" -- had forecast the storm to achieve top wind speeds of 130 mph as it sweeps through the Caribbean Sea.\n\nForecasters also said Sunday that a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic off Africa could become a tropical depression by midweek as it moves toward the eastern and central Caribbean.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect across the eastern Caribbean for Beryl, as the islands braced for the first hurricane of what's expected to be an extremely active storm season.\n\nAt 5 a.m. Sunday, the storm was 420 miles east-southeast of Barbados and moving west at 21 mph.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles from Beryl's center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles. As of 5 a.m. Sunday, its maximum sustained winds were projected to reach 130 mph in the next 24-36 hours, which would make it a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Tobago, and the Grenadine Islands and Grenada, while a tropical storm warning is in effect for Martinique. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Dominica.\n\n\"Development this far east in late June is unusual,\" the forecasters at the hurricane center said. \"In fact, there have only been a few storms in history that have formed over the central or eastern tropical Atlantic this early in the year.\"\n\nBeryl is not expected to affect South Florida.\n\nBy Wednesday, the storm is expected to encounter unfavorable atmospheric conditions, with high-altitude crosswinds that will weaken it.\n\nMeanwhile, a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic, which could become a tropical depression by midweek as it moves toward the eastern and central Caribbean, was given a 40% chance of developing in the next two days and a 70% chance in the next seven days.\n\nIt is expected to move west at 15 to 20 mph, forecasters said.\n\nAlso, a tropical wave moving across the Caribbean and headed west toward inland Mexico could become a short-lived tropical depression.\n\nIt has a 50% chance of developing in the two to seven days.\n\nHeavy rain is expected to affect portions of Central America and Mexico through the weekend.\n\nThe next named storm will be Chris.\n\nThe western Gulf of Mexico generated the 2024 season's first tropical storm last week. Dubbed Alberto, the system made landfall in Mexico 250 miles south of the U.S. border, but sent storm surge and flood to spots 500 miles away in Louisiana.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes.

The government body has updated its travel advice for nine popular holiday spots among UK travellers, as a new hurricane alert is announced, poised to batter the islands imminently.\n\nThe Foreign Office's latest guidance on its website specifically targets those considering trips to St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Barbados, Dominica, St Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda. The officials have issued a stark reminder: \"The hurricane season runs from June to November. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.\"\n\nThis advisory comes as meteorologists issue warnings about tropical storm Beryl, which is expected to escalate into a catastrophic major hurricane before it hits Barbados sometime late Sunday or early Monday. As of Saturday, the storm was tracking towards the southeast Caribbean, with a 'big storm' categorised by winds reaching at least 111 mph (178 kph), equivalent to category 3 or above.\n\nBeryl is tipped to be the second heavyweight hurricane in a season that spans June 1 to November 30 in the Atlantic. The hurricane centre of Beryl is expected to pass roughly 26 miles (45 kilometres) south of Barbados, as stated by Sabu Best, the director of the island's meteorological department.\n\nAccompanied by gusts of wind reaching up to 65 mph (100 kph), Beryl was located approximately 785 miles (1,260 km) southeast of Barbados on Saturday. The hurricane was making its journey westward at a speed of 37 kph (23 mph), reports the Express.\n\nWarnings for hurricanes have been issued for Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. However, Martinique, Dominica, and Tobago were under the alert for a tropical storm.\n\nFlorida-based expert on hurricanes, Michael Lowry, shared on X: \"It's astonishing to see a forecast for a major (Category 3+) hurricane in June anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics. #Beryl organising in a hurry over the warmest waters ever recorded for late June.\"\n\nSaturday saw Beryl situated about 720 miles east-south-east of Barbados, clocking maximum sustained winds at 75mph whilst it continued moving west at 22mph. \"Rapid strengthening is now forecast,\" said the National Hurricane Centre based in Miami.\n\nWarm ocean water fuels Beryl, with the heat content in the deep Atlantic striking the highest on record for this time of year, as highlighted by Brian McNoldy, a researcher specializing in tropical meteorology at the University of Miami.\n\nBeryl has been recorded as the most powerful June tropical storm in that part of the tropical Atlantic, according to Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University.\n\n\"We need to be ready,\" stated Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley during a public address on Friday. \"You and I know when these things happen, it is better to plan for the worst and pray for the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The steady windspeed increases have come after the hurricane center -- saying Beryl was \"rapidly intensifying\" -- had forecast the storm to achieve top wind speeds of 120 mph as it sweeps through the Caribbean Sea.\n\nHurricane warnings went up across the eastern Caribbean, as the islands braced for the first hurricane of what's expected to be an extremely active storm season.\n\nBy Wednesday, the storm is expected to encounter unfavorable atmospheric conditions, with high-altitude crosswinds that will weaken it.\n\nAt 5 a.m. Sunday, the storm was 420 miles east-southeast of Barbados and moving west at 21 mph.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles from Beryl's center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles. As of 5 a.m. Sunday, its maximum sustained winds were projected to reach 130 mph i the next 24-36 hours, which would make it a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Tobago, and the Grenadine Islands and Grenada, while a tropical storm warning is in effect for Martinique. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Dominica.\n\n\"Development this far east in late June is unusual,\" the forecasters at the hurricane center said. \"In fact, there have only been a few storms in history that have formed over the central or eastern tropical Atlantic this early in the year.\"\n\nBeryl is not expected to affect South Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, the hurricane center is tracking two other systems.\n\nA tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic several hundred miles south-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands has become better organized, and has seen its chances of formation over the next 48 hours increase to 40% at 8 a.m., with its seven-day chances remaining at 70%.\n\n\"Some slow development of this system is possible next week while it moves generally westward across the central and western tropical Atlantic at 15 to 20 mph,\" forecasters said.\n\nAlso, a tropical wave that has already been moving across the Caribbean and headed west toward Mexico is producing widespread showers and thunderstorm activity.\n\n\"The disturbance is ... expected to move westward over the Yucatan Peninsula and emerge over the Bay of Campeche late Saturday or early Sunday, at which point some development will be possible,\" forecasters said.\n\nAt that point, as the system heads toward central Mexico, it could develop into a tropical depression.\n\nHeavy rainfall is still expected to affect portions of Central America and Mexico through the weekend.\n\nIt has a 50% chance of formation in the two to seven days.\n\nThe next named storm will be Chris.\n\nThe western Gulf of Mexico generated the 2024 season's first tropical storm last week. Dubbed Alberto, the system made landfall in Mexico 250 miles south of the U.S. border, but sent storm surge and flood to spots 500 miles away in Louisiana.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

It is forecast to spread flooding rains across Barbados later Sunday and become a major Category 4 hurricane by Monday.\n\nRapid intensification is a scientific term used when a storm's winds increase by 35 mph or more in a 24 hour period, a phenomena that has become more common in recent years as the world's oceans warm.\n\n\"Rapid strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, and Beryl is expected to become an extremely dangerous hurricane before it reaches the Windward Islands,\" Eric Blake, a senior hurricane specialist at the center, wrote in an earlier forecast at 5 a.m. \"Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands.\"\n\nIn the next day, Beryl will bring life-threatening winds, storm surge and flooding rain across the Caribbean, including Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, where a warning is in place. After that Beryl sweeps the Windward Islands, an arc-shaped chain at the Caribbean's east end, and it is forecast to push through the sea's heart, possibly threatening Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Cuba before striking Mexico or Central America by Friday.\n\nMost computer models keep Beryl away from US offshore oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, but there is an outside chance the storm could threaten the region later this week.\n\nWhat forecasters find alarming is that Beryl formed in an area of the Atlantic between the Caribbean and the Cabo Verde Islands in June. This stretch of ocean, called the main development region, doesn't usually become active until late August.\n\nAn early start due to warm water and optimal conditions there portends future disasters, and the hurricane center is already tracking what may be the season's next storm after Beryl, near Cabo Verde. Before the six-month season started June 1, forecasters were already predicting the Atlantic would produce upwards of 20 or more storms, when an average year churns out 14.\n\nBeryl is the farthest east a hurricane has formed in June and is forecast to become a major system before July 1, which will make it only one of three to do so, Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said in an email interview. It will be only the third storm so powerful to track through the Caribbean before August since 1851, he added.\n\nThe records Beryl has shattered were set in 1933, when the fourth most active year in Atlantic also released the most energy, and 2005, which had the second highest number storms behind 2020.\n\n\"This isn't a good sign for the upcoming season,\" Klotzbach said.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windward Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eye (cyclone)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenadines"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694461", "eventUri": "eng-9694461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2260, "textEnd": 2266}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2504, "textEnd": 2510}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

A continued quick westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days.\n\nOn the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to move across the Windward Islands early on Monday and across the southeastern Caribbean Sea Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nAircraft data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph with higher gusts, making Beryl a very dangerous category 3 hurricane. Continued rapid strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, and Beryl is expected to become an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane before it reaches the Windward Islands.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles.\n\nA hurricane warning is now in effect for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, Grenada, and Tobago.

Environmental conditions appear conducive for development, and a tropical depression could form by the middle of next week. The NHC gives it a 40% chance of development in the next 48 hours and a 70% chance to develop over the next week.\n\nIf either of these systems develops, the next named storm will be Chris.\n\nFor an explanation of what the watches and warnings mean, scroll to the bottom of this story.\n\nTropical Storm Warning: A tropical storm warning is in effect for the following:\n\nTropical storm watch: A tropical storm watch is in effect for the following:\n\nHow strong is Hurricane Beryl and where is it going?\n\nSpaghetti models for Hurricane Beryl\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal.

Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic,\" hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe NHC said, as of Saturday afternoon, Beryl's maximum sustained winds had increased to near 75 miles per hour (120 km/h) with higher gusts.\n\n\"Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning Sunday night,\" it said, warning of heavy rain, flooding, and \"life-threatening winds and storm surge\".\n\n\"Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 per cent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater,\" the NHC said.\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson wind scale designates Category 1 hurricanes as having wind speeds at least 74 miles per hour, up to Category 5 storms with winds of 157 mph or higher.\n\nAlthough the Meteorological Service of Jamaica (Met Service) said on Saturday afternoon that Beryl is not an immediate threat to Jamaica, Prime Minister Holness noted that various models have projected that the cyclone will probably impact the island.\n\n\"All the models have suggested that if it is not direct impact, it will be in the vicinity of Jamaica. We expect that this will bring adverse weather conditions, and we expect that by Wednesday morning we will be experiencing such conditions,\" Holness said at a consultative conference in St Andrew Southern.\n\n\"I am encouraging all Jamaicans to get your precautionary stocks in place; your stock of goods, food, your batteries and candles, a supply of water just in case. Ensure that your critical documents are secure. If there are any trees or other things that could be of danger to your property, please ensure that you take the necessary actions to secure those items and to secure your property as well,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister said that all the government agencies are in hurricane mode, with the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) on alert, should the worst happen.\n\n\"It is now for the citizens themselves, house owners, people who live alone to be aware of the possibility and take the necessary actions,\" said Holness.\n\n\"It is better to be prepared than to be sorry that you didn't prepare, so I encourage all Jamaicans to take the necessary steps. We are now in the hurricane season, and we should have already taken those steps, but I'm giving advanced notice that there is the potential of serious adverse weather, possibly a tropical storm, possibly a hurricane, so we should take the necessary precautionary steps now,\" he stressed.\n\nEarly on Saturday, expert meteorologist and owner of Continental Weather Corporation Alan Archer said Beryl is estimated to strengthen and then weaken before it passes Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is expected to be strengthening over the next 48 hours and then into the Caribbean Monday, and then beginning Tuesday, once it gets a little further in the Caribbean, the thinking is that conditions will be less favourable for development. It will probably weaken sometime upon approach to Jamaica towards Wednesday night,\" he told the Jamaica Observer .\n\n\"I would expect to see Wednesday night our worst weather...There could be some localised flooding from that as well,\" he warned.\n\n\"At this point in time, I would just keep a real good eye on the weather... I think the confidence level is pretty high on this in light of the fact that from one mile run to the next mile run, the prediction is pretty much on target. It's not varying much,\" he said, urging Jamaicans to still make the necessary preparations.\n\nThe Met Service, in a release on Saturday afternoon, said it will continue to monitor the system.\n\n\"Be advised that, although the projections seem to suggest a direct hit ...on Jamaica sometime on Wednesday next week, the cone actually is indicating that the centre could also pass over 150 miles away from our coastlines. In any case, prepare for the worst,\" the Met Service said on social media platform X.\n\nThe Met Service said it continues to monitor other tropical disturbances over the Atlantic and western Caribbean, as further threats to Jamaica are possible.\n\n\"There is a second system developing behind [Beryl] which is currently being called Tropical Strom Chris and this one is going to track very similar, but being weaker and pass close to Jamaica next Saturday night,\" Archer told the Sunday Observer.\n\nForecasters predict that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be extremely active.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) outlook for the year estimates an 85 per cent chance of an above-normal hurricane season, a 10 per cent chance of a near-normal season, and a five per cent chance of a below-normal season.\n\nThe predicted high level of unusual activity is said to be due to multiple factors which favour tropical storm formation. These include the near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, the development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds, and less wind shear.\n\nRegional forecasters predict there will be up to 29 named storms, 13 of which are likely to become hurricanes, including seven major hurricanes.\n\nIn May the Barbados-based Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology, at its Wet/Hurricane Season Caribbean Climate Outlook Forums, said historical activity in the region is similar to the years 2010, 2013, 2020 and 2023. It added that Sahara dust is also expected to impact weather conditions in the region.\n\n\"With no intrusion or very limited intrusion of the Sahara dust, a hyperactive 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is anticipated,\" said meteorologist Komalchand Dhiram at Hydrometeorological Service of Guyana who presented the findings of the outlook.\n\n\"If there is to be frequent Sahara dust, it will delay the onset of these activities, but not necessarily reduce the impact or the intensity of these activities. And that is because as we move away from August, the intrusion of Saharan dust decreases,\" Dhiram explained.\n\nIn recent years, extreme weather events, including hurricanes, have become more frequent and more devastating as a result of climate change.\n\nTwo weeks ago, torrential rains across Central America left at least 27 people dead in landslides and flooding, mainly in El Salvador, but also in Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nEl Salvador's Environment Minister Fernando Lopez said the deluge was a result of low pressure over the Pacific Ocean, with indirect influence from Tropical Storm Alberto which left four people dead in Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is only the third major hurricane to form in the month of June on record. It remains on track to threaten the Windward Islands of Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Lucia with potential for it to be a rare Category 4 storm in July. Life-threatening winds and storm surge is possible by early Monday for these islands. It is then forecast to move into the Caribbean and continue northwestward as a strong hurricane. Most models keep it south of the Greater Antilles, but forecast it to reach Jamaica and the Caymans by late Wednesday/Thursday as a Category 2 hurricane. Wind shear should help weaken it some the farther west it goes with potential for hurricane impacts in the Yucatan. In the longer range, there is potential for it to continue into the Bay of Campeche and strengthen again. It is too soon to say where it will go from there, but those along the Gulf coast from Louisiana to Texas should watch it closely.\n\nMeanwhile, just behind Beryl, another tropical wave (96L) has a decent chance to become another named system and may become \"Chris\" sometime late this week. It is forecast to follow the path of Beryl. Models indicate it could also become a hurricane and threaten the Lesser Antilles by next weekend.\n\nAnother disturbance in the western Caribbean will drift into Mexico early Monday with little fanfare other than more rain.

Its maximum sustained winds had risen to 100 mph and it was moving west at 21 mph.\n\nThe hurricane center forecast that Beryl's center was set to move across the Windward Islands early on Monday then across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nAccuWeather hurricane experts say that the U.S. is expected to avoid being directly impacted by Beryl.\n\n\"Direct impacts to the

Those two words are used sparingly by me because it is important to be credible not hyperbolic when it comes to weather events. However, it seems like I am using them more often. This morning is no different. When there are major weather events, I scour the data and models as a part of my morning routine. What I am seeing concerning now Category 3 Hurricane Beryl is simply astounding. It has explosively intensified and remains a potential threat for the U.S. by next weekend. Here's what you need to know.\n\nI always start with the authoritative source for the latest information on hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center writes in its morning discussion, \"Beryl's structure is quickly evolving this morning as it undergoes rapid intensification.\" The hurricane is moving into an environment with very warm sea surface temperatures (29 degrees Celsius) and minimal wind shear. NHC goes on to say, \"There's no obvious reason it shouldn't become a very powerful hurricane before impacting the Windward Islands.... the latest NHC intensity forecast will continue to explicitly show rapid intensification over the next day, making Beryl an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane before it moves across the Windward islands.\"\n\nRapid intensification is defined by the NOAA Glossary as, \"An increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 kt in a 24-h period.\" That's roughly 35 mph. DTN senior software engineer and weather expert Sam Lillo's post on X tells you how explosive the intensification of Beryl has been. Lillo explains that Beryl intensified by 65 kt in 36 hours. He also goes on to say, \"It took #Beryl 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane, on June 30th. This has been done 6 other times in Atlantic hurricane history. And the EARLIEST date this was achieved before was ... September 1. SEPTEMBER!\"\n\nThe storm is also unprecedented in other ways too. Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach says Beryl is the first major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) east of the Lesser Antilles during the month of June. If the storm strengthens to Category 4 as expected by July 1st, it will be the earliest Category 4 storm on record. Klotzbach posted, \"Current Atlantic record for earliest Category 4 hurricane is Hurricane Dennis on July 8, 2005.\" By the way, Beryl is also the third earliest Category 3 storm on record behind Alma (1966) and Audrey (1957), according to Klotzbach.\n\nBeryl is likely to encounter a bit more wind shear as it moves further into the Caribbean Sea, which could moderate the explosive intensification trend. However, as the storm moves into the western Caribbean, forecast models are hinting at less shear again. Remember, hurricanes develop better when there is less wind shear (wind speed or direct changes as you go up in altitude) and high ocean heat content. For the latter, there is plenty of that. NHC also points out, \"There aren't any significant track changes from the previous advisory with an extensive mid-level ridge north of Beryl expected to steer the system westward or west-northwestward for several days. Model guidance remains in tight agreement on the forecast track ....\"\n\nBeyond five days, there is always more uncertainty in the track forecast. Right now, the European model suggests a stronger storm moving southward into Mexico by the weekend. However, the American GFS models hints at a weaker storm into the Gulf of Mexico and landfalling in Texas. I fully expect the models to come into better agreement in the coming hours to days as the intensity scenarios clarify in the western Caribbean. As such, if you live along the western Gulf Coast in the U.S., Central America or Mexico, pay attention.\n\nThere is also another storm trailing Beryl, but I will deal with that another time.",

Of those, seven become hurricanes with three becoming major (Category 3 or above) storms.\n\nWhy such an active season? Dr. Phil Klotzbach, lead forecaster at CSU, says it's because of two main factors -- above-normal sea surface temperatures and expected La Ni\u00f1a conditions this summer. The warm water adds more energy to the tropics, making fuel for these storms more available. But perhaps more importantly, La Ni\u00f1a usually reduces vertical wind shear.\n\nWinds blowing across a developing or mature tropical system can keep a budding system from developing and weaken stronger storms.

The forecast indicates it will bring potentially deadly winds and storm surges to the Windward Islands as an extremely dangerous hurricane,\" the NHC reported from its X account.\n\nIn its latest update, the NHC located the center of the hurricane near 10.7 north, 53.1 west, moving westward at 18 knots (33.3 km/h). The powerful hurricane has maximum sustained winds of 85 knots (157 km/h) with gusts up to 105 knots (194 km/h). Although the winds and waves vary greatly in each quadrant, the meteorological center has recorded waves up to 12 feet (3.65 meters).\n\n\"Beryl is expected to be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane when it reaches the Windward Islands early Monday, bringing destructive hurricane-force winds and potentially deadly storm surges. Hurricane warnings are in effect for much of the Windward Islands,\" the NHC warned.\n\nAdditionally, the NHC forecasted \"heavy rains and localized flooding in the Windward Islands tonight and Monday,\" and recommended monitoring the progress of this system. \"Users are reminded that there is significant uncertainty on days 4 and 5, and they should not focus on the specific details of the track or intensity forecast,\" the NHC cautioned, considering the evolution of the first hurricane of the season.\n\nFor now, the NHC has issued a hurricane warning for the islands of Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. For Martinique and Tobago, the advisory is for a tropical storm.\n\n\"It is surprising to see a forecast for a major hurricane (Category 3+) in June anywhere in the Atlantic, much less so far east in the deep tropics. Beryl is rapidly organizing over the warmest waters ever recorded for late June. Hurricane watch for much of the Windward Islands,\" tweeted expert Michael Lowry.\n\nAccording to the forecast map provided by Lowry, hurricane Beryl is expected to reach the eastern tip of Cuba by Wednesday morning as a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 168 km/h. By Thursday morning, it would be located south of the island, at the level of its central region, but as a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 144 km/h.\n\nMeanwhile, the Weather Forecast Center of the Institute of Meteorology of Cuba (INSMET) forecasted some showers and thunderstorms for this Sunday. \"It will dawn predominantly cloudy in the western region and partly cloudy in the rest of the country, with occasional showers in the extreme northeastern part. In the morning, it will be partly cloudy, and from the afternoon, it will be mostly cloudy with some showers, rains, and thunderstorms,\" INSMET pointed out.\n\nLocated about 3,000 kilometers away from Cuba, the effects of Beryl have not yet reached the largest of the Antilles. This Sunday, the winds will be from the east, with speeds between 10 and 25 kilometers per hour, and weak variables along the southern coast. \"There will be little surf, except on the northeastern coast where there will be waves, which will decrease to light surf by the afternoon,\" INSMET specified, reminding that \"in areas of showers and thunderstorms, the strength of the winds and the height of the waves can increase.\"", "source": {"uri": "cubaheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CubaHeadlines"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windward Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beaufort scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tobago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martinique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Martinique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antilles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn0.celebritax.com/sites/default/files/styles/watermark_100/public/1719742097-beryl-convierte-huracan-extremadamente-peligroso-rumbo-cuba.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694461", "eventUri": "eng-9694461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It was moving quickly westward at 21 mph over the open waters of the central Atlantic Ocean. Beryl rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph after first becoming a tropical depression on Friday, tropical storm early Saturday morning, and first hurricane of the season Saturday afternoon.\n\nBeryl is the easternmost hurricane to form in the tropical Atlantic during the month of June, beating out a 90+ year old record. The first hurricane of the season typically forms around August 11, using an average from 1991-2020, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center expects Beryl to continue to intensify over record warm water for this time of year before it strikes the Windward Islands early Monday.\n\nA narrow corridor of devastating wind damage is possible where Beryl's tiny eyewall moves over one or multiple of these islands as it enters the Caribbean early Monday. Life-threatening storm surge and rainfall flooding is also expected in these areas through Monday.\n\nBeryl will move into the eastern Caribbean Sea later Monday. We then expect it to take a general west-northwest track in the Caribbean Sea through the Fourth of July week. Beryl could eventually pose a danger to Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula later this week. However, there's uncertainty in that exact track.\n\nOne other uncertainty is how much wind shear Beryl will face in the Caribbean Sea. Typically this time of year, Caribbean wind shear is strong enough to weaken or completely fizzle tropical systems approaching from the east. However, model forecasts have hinted that wind shear could be lower than usual, which could allow Beryl to maintain its hurricane intensity longer in the western Caribbean Sea later this week.\n\nIt's too soon to determine exactly where Beryl may go in the western half of the Caribbean Sea later next week. All interests around the Caribbean Sea should monitor the forecast of Beryl closely the next several days. It's also far too soon to tell if Beryl will eventually threaten any part of the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nCLICK HERE for more.", "source": {"uri": "kadn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KADN News 15"}, "authors": [{"uri": "weather_channel@kadn.com", "name": "Weather Channel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windward Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weather_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Weather Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eye (cyclone)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belize"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/Caribbean", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/Caribbean", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kadn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/96/e9681ffe-36db-11ef-9c36-a768caf0ff5a/66814f0758743.image.png?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694461", "eventUri": "eng-9694461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 915, "textEnd": 924}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Category 3 storm a sign to start getting your home ready", "body": "Beryl, the second named storm and first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, ramped up extremely quickly over the weekend largely due to record-warm ocean temperatures, forecasters said.\n\nIn just three days the storm intensified from a tropical depression into a powerful Category 3 hurricane with life-threatening winds and storm surge, the National Hurricane Center reported Sunday morning.\n\nHurricane Beryl is moving fast -- 21 mph, as of 8 a.m. Sunday -- and is expected to reach the first islands in the eastern Caribbean by Monday morning, the NHC said.\n\nSo far, forecasters are not predicting a Florida impact but it's too early to say for certain. After Beryl moves into the Central Caribbean, where it goes next depends on several factors such as how it interacts with land and an area of high pressure over the southeastern United States that may keep it going west-northwest, according to Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"Direct impacts to the United States look unlikely; however, it is very important to note that if the high pressure across the Southeast weakens, that can allow the storm to move farther north and potentially directly impact the Gulf Coast,\" DaSilva said.\n\nBeryl also could churn up rough seas and cause more dangerous rip currents in the Gulf of Mexico, which have already caused multiple drownings off Florida coasts in the last few weeks.\n\nBeryl marks the beginning of what Colorado State University meteorologists called an \"extremely active\" season. AccuWeather predicts an \"explosive\" season that could break the record of 30 named storms and Florida's Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger calls the new season \"hyperactive.\" All of them expect at least 20-24 named storms and around four to seven major hurricanes.\n\nEven if Beryl passes us by, it can be a reminder to get your home ready for the eventual hurricane that comes our way. Prepping for storms is much easier and less nerve-wracking while the sky is still blue.\n\n2024 hurricane season preparation: What supplies do you need for a storm? Here's a list\n\nThere's no need to start boarding up your windows now, but you might want to start watching for good prices on plywood or sales on storm shutters and start cleaning up your yard.\n\nOn a budget? Here's 5 cheap ways to prepare your home for Florida's hurricane season\n\nNo house? You still need to be ready: How do I prepare for a hurricane in my apartment?\n\nYour homeowners assocation may no longer prevent you from hardening your home against hurricanes, according to a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in May.\n\nUnder HB 293, Hurricane Protections for Homeowners' Associations, HOAs must create hurricane protection specifications concerning the \"color and style\" but they cannot prohibit any homeowner from installing or upgrading hurricane protection products.\n\nPermitted hurricane protection products include, but are not limited to roof systems, permanent fixed or roll-down storm shutters, impact-resistant windows and doors, reinforced garage doors, exterior fixed generators, fuel storage tanks and other hurricane protection products used to preserve and protect the structures or improvements on a parcel\n\nThere are two Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holidays in Florida this year. The first was during the first two weeks of June. The second one will be from Aug. 24 through Sept. 6.\n\nDuring that time, there will be no sales tax on specific items for storm prepping such as flashlights under $40, tarps under $100, batteries under $50, generators $3,000 or less, and many more. The busiest months of hurricane season are August through October, with the peak occurring Sept. 10.\n\nCheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida contributed to this story.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Daytona Beach News-Journal: Hurricane Beryl roars toward Caribbean as Category 3.

Beryl is the second named storm of the season after Tropical Storm Alberto, which made landfall in north-east Mexico on 20 June. The heavy rains of that storm killed four people.

It is moving quickly westward over the open waters of the central Atlantic Ocean. Beryl rapidly intensified since it became a tropical depression on Friday and tropical storm early Saturday morning.\n\nBeryl is the easternmost hurricane to form in the tropical Atlantic during the month of June, beating out a 90+ year old record.\n\nThe first hurricane of the season typically forms around August 11, using an average from 1991-2020, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nWindward Islands danger: Beryl will continue to rapidly intensify on Sunday. The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center shown below expects Beryl to become the season's first Category 3 or stronger hurricane over record warm water for this time of year before it strikes the Windward Islands early Monday.\n\n(MORE: What The Forecast Cone Means, And Doesn't)\n\nWatches, warnings and impacts: Hurricane warnings continue for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadine Islands and for Grenada.\n\nPreparations should be rushed to completion in the hurricane-warned areas.\n\nA narrow corridor of devastating wind damage is possible where Beryl's eyewall comes ashore over one or multiple of these islands as it enters the Caribbean early Monday.\n\nLife-threatening storm surge and rainfall flooding is also expected in these areas through Monday.\n\nBeryl's uncertain Caribbean future: Beryl will move into the eastern Caribbean Sea later Monday.\n\nWe then expect it to take a general west-northwest track in the Caribbean Sea through the Fourth of July week.\n\nBeryl could eventually pose a danger to Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula later this week. However, there's uncertainty in that exact track, as shown in the model forecast track map below.\n\nOne other uncertainty is how much wind shear Beryl will face in the Caribbean Sea. Typically this time of year, Caribbean wind shear is strong enough to weaken or completely fizzle tropical systems approaching from the east. However, model forecasts have hinted that wind shear could be lower than usual, which could allow Beryl to maintain its hurricane intensity longer in the western Caribbean Sea later this week.\n\nThe bottom line: It's too soon to determine exactly what kind of shape Beryl will be in when it gets to the western half of the Caribbean Sea later this week. All interests around the Caribbean Sea should monitor the forecast of Beryl closely over the next several days.\n\nIt's also too soon to tell if Beryl will eventually threaten any part of the U.S. Gulf Coast. Again, check back with us at weather.com for forecast updates in the coming days.\n\nThat's not all we're watching: There are two other tropical disturbances in the Atlantic Basin, as depicted in the map below.\n\nOne system in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean, Invest 96L, has a high chance of development this week. It will remain over the open ocean until nearing the Windward Islands around the middle of this week, just a couple of days after Beryl's devastating strike.\n\nThe other system near Mexico, Invest 94L, has a medium chance of becoming a short-lived tropical system over the Bay of Campeche before it glides into eastern Mexico by Monday.\n\n(MORE: What Is An Invest?)\n\nHeavy rain threat: Regardless of development, Invest 94L could dump locally heavy rainfall over southern and eastern Mexico. Local flash flooding and landslides are possible, especially in areas of higher terrain.\n\nSome increased swells, rip currents and coastal flooding are also possible along parts of the Mexican and Texas Gulf Coast into at least early Monday.\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days - only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nTropical Atlantic development has happened in June as recently as last year. As senior meteorologist Chris Dolce discussed, tropical development east of the Lesser Antilles where Beryl is located in June is unusual, but has happened in recent years, including 2023.\n\nLast June, tropical storms Bret, then Cindy, each developed well east of the Lesser Antilles in less than a week's time. It was the first time on record two tropical storms formed east of the Lesser Antilles (east of the Caribbean islands) during the month.\n\nBonnie first became a tropical storm in late June 2022 east of Trinidad and Tobago before it traversed the rest of the southern Caribbean Sea, then later became an eastern Pacific hurricane.\n\nAt the end of June 2021, what would later become Hurricane Elsa first became a tropical storm in almost the same location as 2022's Bonnie.\n\nCheck back with us at weather.com for updates to this forecast as the details become clearer in the days ahead.\n\nMORE

After Beryl moves into the Central Caribbean, where it goes next depends on several factors such as how it interacts with land and an area of high pressure over the southeastern United States that may keep it going west-northwest, according to Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"Direct impacts to the United States look unlikely; however, it is very important to note that if the high pressure across the Southeast weakens, that can allow the storm to move farther north and potentially directly impact the Gulf Coast,\" DaSilva said.\n\nBeryl also could churn up rough seas and cause more dangerous rip currents in the Gulf of Mexico, which have already caused multiple drownings off Florida coasts in the last few weeks.\n\nBeryl marks the beginning of what Colorado State University meteorologists called an \"extremely active\" season. AccuWeather predicts an \"explosive\" season that could break the record of 30 named storms and Florida's Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger calls the new season \"hyperactive.\" All of them expect at least 20-24 named storms and around four to seven major hurricanes.\n\nEven if Beryl passes us by, it can be a reminder to get your home ready for the eventual hurricane that comes our way.

Here's 5 cheap ways to prepare your home for Florida's hurricane season\n\nPREPARING YOUR HOME INSIDE\n\nNo house? You still need to be ready: How do I prepare for a hurricane in my apartment?\n\nUnder HB 293, Hurricane Protections for Homeowners' Associations, HOAs must create hurricane protection specifications concerning the \"color and style\" but they cannot prohibit any homeowner from installing or upgrading hurricane protection products.\n\nPermitted hurricane protection products include, but are not limited to roof systems, permanent fixed or roll-down storm shutters, impact-resistant windows and doors, reinforced garage doors, exterior fixed generators, fuel storage tanks and other hurricane protection products used to preserve and protect the structures or improvements on a parcel\n\nWhen is Florida's disaster preparedness sales tax holiday?\n\nThere are two Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holidays in Florida this year. The first was during the first two weeks of June. The second one will be from Aug. 24 through Sept. 6.\n\nDuring that time, there will be no sales tax on specific items for storm prepping such as flashlights under $40, tarps under $100, batteries under $50, generators $3,000 or less, and many more.

Exceptional and record-setting Hurricane Beryl is charging toward the southeastern Caribbean islands. Hurricane Warnings have been issued for the islands where the threat is the highest. On the current schedule, the weather will deteriorate late Sunday, and the maximum impact will be on Monday.\n\nA Hurricane Warning does not mean that hurricane conditions will for sure occur. It means that there is a danger that they could occur based on the best information available. Therefore, full hurricane preparations are required where the warnings are posted.\n\nNow that Hurricane Beryl is well organized, and the steering high-pressure system to the north is strong and stable, we can have higher confidence in the track. Hurricane Warnings extend from Grenada in the south to St. Lucia in the north, plus Barbados. Nearby islands will also feel significant effects. Since Beryl is a small hurricane in diameter, the worst of the extreme winds will likely not impact more than one or two islands. But it's too early to know the exact maximum impact zone.\n\nThis is an extraordinary and unprecedented event for this time of year. Barbados and the islands of the southeast Caribbean are no strangers to hurricanes. But only once has a hurricane traversed this zone in June in the record book. That was in 1933, which ranks as one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record, and it was a Category 1.\n\nThe upper-level wind pattern is extremely conducive for Beryl to strengthen as it approaches the islands and passes into the Caribbean. By late Tuesday, however, it will be facing a bit of a headwind, which is why the National Hurricane Center is showing some weakening on days 4 and 5 in the forecast.\n\nThis may be a harbinger of things to come, or it might be something more like a freak event that Beryl and the system that's following it (called Invest 96L) formed just below the Saharan dust plume. Normally, the dust impedes development of systems as they move off Africa this time of year.\n\nConfidence is high that Beryl will track across the central Caribbean until midweek and not impact Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands in a significant way. The track's bend to the north is due to a dip in the jet stream moving off the U.S. East Coast, which will pull it north. High pressure will then build across the southern U.S., which should push Beryl south again as it moves into the western Caribbean.\n\nAfter that, things get fuzzier. The odds favor high pressure holding it to the south of the U.S. But if the high pressure moves out of the way too soon, there is some chance the storm could slow and possibly turn into the Gulf. There are too many variables, including the speed of the storm, its intensity and the movement of the blocking high to predict with confidence what will happen at the end of the week.\n\nFor now, our concern is for the affected Caribbean Islands. Hurricane Beryl has the potential to be a catastrophic event if its relatively narrow band of intense winds impacts a populated island. With luck, the strongest winds will find a gap between the islands, which sometimes happens.\n\nThe system, officially called Invest 96L, is two days behind Beryl. If this system attains winds of 40 mph, it will be named Tropical Storm Chris (or possibly Debby, depending on what happens in the Gulf). Potential Chris will find a similarly conducive environment to the one that allowed Beryl to get so strong, though maybe not as pristine. The question is, how soon can potential Chris get organized to take advantage of the supportive atmospheric regime?\n\nOn the current schedule, potential Chris or whatever it is, would impact the eastern Caribbean islands about Wednesday. Because the disturbance is still disorganized, the strength of the system at that time is unknowable.\n\nIf Beryl coming through the islands as a Category 3 or higher hurricane is extraordinary, the idea of two storms in two days on similar tracks is insane. We'll see.\n\nThe system the National Hurricane Center has been calling Invest 94L has a decent chance today to turn into a tropical depression or tropical storm in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The system is reasonably well-developed, but it will be operating so close to land and have such a short window over the water that it may or may not have time to organize.\n\nThe threat with this system continues to be to Mexico and Central America, where extreme amounts of rain have fallen over the past few weeks.\n\nThis flurry of tropical activity is at least partially related to a pulse called the MJO that propagates around the Earth every 30-60 days. When it gets to just the right position, it enhances the likelihood of storms developing. The current pulse is relatively weak, but it is positioned for maximum Atlantic storm-enhancing impact. The pulse will move on as we get into July. Hopefully, things will calm down, but let's not count on it.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_norcross@foxweather.com", "name": "Bryan Norcross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sahara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Chris_(1988)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Chris (1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1024/512/hurricane-hq-1.png?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694461", "eventUri": "eng-9694461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles should closely monitor the progress of Beryl. Additional watches and warnings may be required later today.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\n----------------------\n\nAt 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Beryl was located near latitude 10.6 North, longitude 53.9 West. Beryl is moving toward the west near 21 mph (33 km/h). A continued quick westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next few days. On the forecast track, the center of Beryl is expected to move across the Windward Islands early on Monday and across the southeastern Caribbean Sea Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nAircraft data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts, making Beryl a very dangerous category 3 hurricane. Continued rapid strengthening is forecast over the next day or so, and Beryl is expected to become an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane before it reaches the Windward Islands.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters is 968 mb (28.58 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n----------------------\n\nWIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area beginning early on Monday. Devastating wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area starting late tonight, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area starting late tonight.\n\nWind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.\n\nSTORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore flow near where Beryl makes landfall in the hurricane warning area. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nRAINIFARAINFALL: Hurricane Beryl is expected to produce rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches across Barbados and the Windward Islands tonight and Monday. This rainfall may cause flash flooding in vulnerable areas.\n\nSURF: Large swells generated by Beryl are expected across Windward and southern Leeward Islands during the next couple of days. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\nForecaster Cangialos", "source": {"uri": "thedailyherald.sx", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Ask a Sailor Moon fan how to say name of first hurricane", "body": "Hurricane Beryl is motoring west across the Atlantic, rapidly strengthening along the way. It gained hurricane status late Saturday afternoon, and the National Hurricane Center expects the storm to become a major hurricane as early as Monday. Whether it will impact Florida or the American Gulf of Mexico is yet unknown, but Barbados became the first island to institute a hurricane warning Saturday.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization is known to include some unusual names for hurricanes. Last year, Hurricane Idalia was another major hurricane with an unusual name, smashing into Florida's Big Bend region in late August as a Category 4 storm. Names in 2022 included Gaston and Hermine, names you'd find in Disney movies and Harry Potter (yes, we know her name is Hermione) but not often in real life.\n\nThough the name may look strange to American eyes, it's simple to pronounce: BER-uhl. It rhymes with the more common Cheryl.\n\nFans of 1990s anime -- that's Japanese cartoons for the non-otaku audience -- will likely be intimately familiar with the name. Queen Beryl was the main villain of Season 1 of \"Sailor Moon,\" one of the most influential shows of the time.\n\nBeryl is Greek in origin, according to baby-name site The Bump. It is derived from beryllos, Greek for the color of the sea. It also comes from beryllium, a sea-green mineral or sea stone. According to Behind The Name, the name can be traced back to Sanskrit.\n\nThis adds up for fans of Sailor Moon: Queen Beryl's key henchmen are all named after precious stones, too (Jadeite, Nephrite, Zoisite and Kunzite).\n\nNot very, as you might have guessed. According to The Bump's registry of baby names, Beryl came in No. 10,390 for girls' names in the U.S. in 2023. The name actually is up after a sharp spike from 2008 to 2012.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_(Florida)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bend (Florida)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greek language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sailor Moon (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoisite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoisite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadeite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jadeite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nephrite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spodumene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spodumene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanskrit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gemstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beryllium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694461", "eventUri": "eng-9694461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

It should weaken by mid-week, but still be a hurricane on its way to Mexico.\n\nA hurricane is a storm system rotating around an area of low pressure that produces strong winds and heavy rain. The storm is classified as a hurricane when the sustained wind speeds exceed 119 kilometers per hour.\n\nHurricane season begins on May 15 in the Pacific and June 1 in the Atlantic. It ends in both regions on November 30th.\n\nHurricanes often gain strength as they move over the ocean.

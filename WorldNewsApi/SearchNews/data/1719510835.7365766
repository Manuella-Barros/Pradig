The German ambassador to China, Patricia Flor, said a \u201cmore efficient multilateral system\u201d was needed to tackle the multiple crises facing the world, including climate change, the Ukraine war and the weakening of human and women\u2019s rights. Addressing these challenges would require greater cooperation and integration between countries, and a \u201cpeaceful adaptation\u201d of global institutions, from the World Trade Organization to the UN, Flor said at the annual forum of the Centre for China and Globalisation (CCG), a Beijing-based think tank. \u201cThe way should be to look at a reform that makes our global order fit for purpose, for the tasks and the challenges that we confront,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to address some of the inefficiencies [of current global frameworks],\u201d Flor added, citing how the UN Security Council was \u201cless able to act\u201d in a time of heightened geopolitical tensions and crisis. The more we have conflicts with China and among us, the weaker our ability to collectively address some of these issues.\u201d Patricia Flor, ambassador of Germany to China The war in Ukraine has revealed cracks in the Security Council, which has repeatedly failed to act swiftly and fulfil its responsibility of maintaining international peace and stability. To that end, China \u2013 as a global power and a permanent member of the UN Security Council \u2013 had a \u201creally big responsibility\u201d to shape future changes, Flor said. \u201cWhatever China does matters for the multilateral order as a whole and for our ability to steer reforms in the multilateral system, because the more we have conflicts with China and among us, the weaker our ability to collectively address some of these issues.\u201d Flor was among ambassadors to China who had gathered for a round-table talk on multilateralism as part of the annual CCG forum in Beijing. Her views were echoed by Turkish ambassador Ismail Hakki Musa, who said China had a \u201chuge responsibility\u201d to drive reforms of international institutions, which he described as \u201cnot representative at all\u201d. While the existing liberal international order may have prevented a third world war, it had \u201cfallen short of offering sustainable peace and security for all\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cCurrent global governance mechanisms are unable to address global challenges timely, fairly and effectively.\u201d Calling for a robust global system based on solidarity rather than polarity, Musa noted that Turkey had continued to call for a reform of the United Nations and other multilateral institutions to create a \u201cjust and fair new order\u201d. Calls for UN reform, particularly for restructuring the Security Council, have grown louder in recent years. The council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States \u2013 represent the victors of World War II, and countries including Brazil, Germany, India and Japan have been pushing to join them. The political, economic, environmental and technological challenges facing the international system indicated the \u201cpressing necessity and inevitability\u201d of a transformation, Musa told the forum, also attended by envoys from New Zealand, Argentina and Estonia. \u201cI think we almost agree on some inefficiencies of the current system. Let\u2019s not wait for a major conflict in order to reform it,\u201d he said, pointing out that new systems were previously established after such conflicts. Jorge Toledo, the European Union envoy, also voiced similar sentiments, saying the world was moving \u201cfrom globalisation to fragmentation\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to reinforce our multipolar system,\u201d he said. \u201cA very simple way\u201d to do that would be to reinforce, align, and insist on the basic principles of the UN Charter, Toledo said, adding that these should be applied universally, as a compromise would lead to fragmentation and conflict. \u201cChina, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has a special responsibility to protect the basic rules, the basic principles of the charter,\u201d he said. According to Siyabonga Cwele, the South African ambassador to China, the existing world order is facing challenges like growing unilateralism, geopolitical rivalries, and \u201cat some times blatant violation of international law and application of double standards\u201d. The result, he said, was a steady erosion of trust between countries that had weakened the ability of the international community to address shared challenges. While the UN had made significant contributions to issues like poverty and human rights, it must be modernised to be more effective and inclusive, Cwele said. \u201cWe believe that multilateralism, which is the notion of collective solutions, must be at the heart of the engagement between member states \u2026 guided by the UN Charter,\u201d he said. \u201cNew momentum and political will is then required to strengthen and transform multilateral relations.\u201d", "summary": "China, as a permanent Security Council member and global power, has a \u2018big responsibility\u2019 to help the world order rise to the challenges of the times, foreign ambassadors at round-table talks in Beijing say.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3264166/china-has-huge-responsibility-reshape-world-order-reform-global-bodies-un-wto-foreign-envoys-beijing", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/26/13c6d401-708b-4d1a-88e9-68df82799bf8_3287ff06.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:00:18", "author": "Dewey Sim,Sylvie Zhuang", "authors": ["Dewey Sim", "Sylvie Zhuang"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.303}

I will not vote. \"\n\nPezeshkian, the sole moderate among the six candidates who were approved by a hardline watchdog body to stand, has pledged to foster a pragmatic foreign policy and ease nuclear tensions with the West. Two hardline subsequently candidates pulled out.\n\nA CRITIC LOYAL TO KHAMENEI\n\nAt the same time, Pezeshkian promised in TV debates and interviews not to contest Khamenei's policies, which analysts said risks further alienating the urban middle class and young voters. These groups no longer seek mere reform and instead now directly challenge the Islamic Republic as a whole.\n\nAs a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, who is an Azeri ethnic minority and supports the rights of ethnic minorities, has criticised the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.\n\nIn 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country.\n\nBut at a Tehran University meeting earlier this month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to anti-government protests, Pezeshkian said \"political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority\".\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, who held roles as both a combatant and a physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines.\n\nHe was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.\n\nPezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.", "source": {"uri": "kayhanlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KAYHAN LIFE"}, "authors": [{"uri":

voter support amid calls for change", "body": "Tehran (AFP) - The first round of Iran's presidential election revealed shrinking support for both reformists and conservatives even though some voters are pushing for change by backing the sole reformist candidate, analysts say.\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, the reformist contender, and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili led the polls held on Friday to replace the late ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nFriday's vote, marked by a historically low turnout, \"clearly shows that both reformists' and conservatives' bases have considerably shrunk,\" said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.\n\n\"The reformists brought out the big guns and tried their best to mobilise their base,\" Vaez said on social media platform X, but \"it was simply insufficient.\"\n\nLikewise, the conservatives failed to garner sufficient votes \"despite the tremendous resources they deployed,\" he added.\n\nVaez pointed out that the combined votes of Jalili and conservative parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who came in third, totalled 12.8 million.\n\nThat figure was well below Raisi's nearly 18 million votes in the 2021 election.\n\nOf the 61 million eligible voters, only about 40 percent cast ballots, marking a record low turnout in the Islamic Republic where some people have lost faith in the process.\n\nMore than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nFor Vaez, the decline in turnout, from around 49 percent in 2021, was \"a real embarrassment for the leadership\" in Iran, where ultimate political power lies with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nNo 'miracle'\n\nPolitical commentator Mohammad Reza Manafi said Pezeshkian's lead reflected a push for \"fundamental changes\" regarding the economy and relations with the rest of the world.\n\nHowever, those favouring Pezeshkian \"do not expect a miracle or a quick solution but hope he can gradually prevent conditions from worsening,\" Manafi added.\n\nIran has been reeling from the economic impact of international sanctions, which have contributed to soaring inflation, high unemployment and a record low for the Iranian rial against the US dollar.\n\nThe vote also came amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war between Israel and Tehran's ally Hamas, and diplomatic tensions over Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nPezeshkian, an outspoken heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008, came out on top thanks to his \"clean record without any accusations of financial corruption,\" said Manafi.\n\nOfficial figures showed Pezeshkian with 42.4 percent of the vote, against 38.6 percent for Jalili.\n\nThe reformist has urged \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European capitals to \"get Iran out of its isolation.\"\n\nIn contrast, Jalili is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nHe is a former nuclear negotiator and currently a representative of Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nDuring his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters under the slogan \"no compromise, no surrender\" to the West.\n\nHe staunchly opposed the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief.\n\nAt the time, Jalili argued that the pact violated Iran's \"red lines\" by accepting inspections of nuclear sites.\n\nIn a Sunday column in the ultraconservative Javan daily, political expert Ali Alavi hailed Jalili's \"honesty and truthfulness, unlike the others.\"\n\nThe candidate also received support from Ghalibaf, who after Saturday's result urged his support base to back Jalili in next Friday's runoff.\n\nTwo ultraconservatives who dropped out a day before the election have also endorsed Jalili.\n\nBut on Sunday the reformist newspaper Etemad quoted former vice president Isa Kalantari warning against a continued conservative grip on the government.\n\n\"The country will be in peril and it will face numerous problems and challenges,\" he said.\n\nVaez said the \"Jalili fear factor can't be overlooked.\"\n\n\"Many who didn't vote in this round might in the next one: not because they hope for better, but because they fear the worse.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Mohammad Marandi, however, said Jalili may not be \"the sort of radical that is depicted by his opponents.\"\n\nMarandi believes that Iran, under either of the two candidates, will \"continue to pursue strong ties with the Global South\" countries.\n\nHe added that they \"will still attempt to see what can be done with the nuclear deal,\" though Jalili \"will just approach it with more scepticism.\"", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person",

Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalization and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiraled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesperson Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner get more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected the late President Ebrahim Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over reportedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Nasser Karimi of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "nwaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_demonstration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political demonstration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

most votes.\n\nAccording to the final results announced by Iran's Interior Ministry on Saturday morning, less than 12 hours after the voting lines closed, the reformist candidate received 10.4 million votes out of a total of 24.5 million votes counted.\n\nSaeed Jalili, the former lead nuclear negotiator, came in second with 9.4 million votes and will face Pezeskian in the run-off election on July 5.\n\nA relatively low-profile political figure, Pezeshkian served as the health minister in the government of Mohammad Khatami (2001-2005) and has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in the Iranian parliament since 2008.\n\nA cardiologist by training, Pezeshkian previously also headed the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, one of the leading medical institutions in northern Iran.\n\nHis two previous unsuccessful bids for the presidency came in 2013 and 2021, respectively.\n\nIn 2013, he withdrew from the race in the later stages in favor of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, and in 2021, his candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council, the country's top vetting body.\n\nAs the only reformist candidate in the race this time, backed by the country's leading reformist coalition, Pezeshkian engaged in hectic campaigning in the past few weeks.\n\nHis campaign was bolstered by the presence of many former reformist politicians and ministers, including Javad Zarif, who served as Iran's foreign minister for two terms under former President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nPre-election opinion polls showed significant support for Pezeshkian, especially after the five televised presidential debates in which he was vocal about both domestic and foreign policy issues.\n\nPezeshkian has given indications that he is more open to diplomatic engagement with the world, including the West, and intends to initiate reforms in both economic and cultural domains.\n\nIn presidential debates, he asserted that sanctions were acting as a roadblock in attracting trade partners and that achieving an 8% growth rate was impossible without opening borders.\n\nHe also vigorously defended the 2015 nuclear deal that was reached between Iran and the world powers during the administration of his fellow reformist Rouhani.\n\nPezeshkian has also been vocal about women-centric issues, including the mandatory Hijab (Islamic headscarf), expressing his opposition to the

presidency runoff", "body": "The sole reformist in Iran's presidential election, Masoud Pezeshkian, will face the ultraconservative Saeed Jalili in a runoff, authorities said on Saturday, following a vote marred by historically low turnout.\n\nPezeshkian secured 42.4 percent of the vote, while Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, came second with 38.6 per cent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf was next with 13.8 per cent, while the only other candidate, conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, got less than one percent.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes,\" electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said.\n\nIn his first post-election remarks, Pezeshkian thanked his supporters and urged them to vote again next Friday \"to save the country from poverty, lies, discrimination and injustice\".\n\n\"I hope your presence will be the basis of a new voice for change in attitude, behaviour, conversation and in the distribution and allocation of resources,\" he added in a video published on the website of the reformist newspaper Etemad.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called for a high turnout ahead of Friday's vote.\n\nOnly slightly more than 40 percent of the 61 million electorate took part -- a record low turnout for the Islamic republic -- and more than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nThe poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two of them -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out.\n\nAfter the final results were released, they both asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the July 5 runoff.\n\nGhalibaf followed suit, asking \"all revolutionary forces and supporters\" to get behind Jalili's bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, the Guardian Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the election.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.", "source": {"uri":

In the first round, Pezeshkian unexpectedly secured 10.41 million votes (42.4 per cent) and Jalili 9.47 million (38.6 per cent).\n\nPezeshkian is the sole reformist out of six candidates qualified to stand by the 12-member Guardian Council which vets all nominations and appointments. The rest were conservatives of differing degrees.\n\nBorn to an Azeri father and Kurdish mother, Pezeshkian can expect backing from these minority communities as well as reformists. He is a surgeon who served as health minister and is a sitting member of parliament. He has pledged to revive the 2015 deal limiting Iran's nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief, which could boost the faltering economy.\n\nHe would promote reconciliation between the disaffected populace and domineering clerics and cultivate relations with the West. Pezeshkian has the support of reformists Mohammed Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, who eased conservative impositions during their presidencies and promoted reconciliation with the US and Europe despite Washington's rejection of Tehran's advances.\n\nJalili is the most hardline conservative selected. After losing part of his right leg while a soldier during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88), he is considered a \"living martyr\". He was nuclear negotiator and secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and currently serves in the Expediency Council, which advises supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Jalili has promised to lower inflation, grow the economy, fight corruption and mismanagement and reject ties to the West.\n\nThe first-round turnout - the lowest since Iran's 1979 revolution - was only 24.5 million in an apathetic and boycotting electorate of 61 million. If Pezeshkian can convince Iranians to turnout and vote for him in the coming around, he could win.\n\nIf not, Jalili is likely to triumph by gaining most of the 3.38 million votes cast for conservative candidate Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who came third in the first round. The fourth candidate was Shia cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi with only 206,397 votes. Two other conservative candidates dropped out before polling day and urged supporters to back Jalili.\n\nThe snap election was called to replace ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. Turnout was a low 48 per cent in 2021 when the election was engineered to secure victory for Raisi who was seen as a potential successor to Khamenei (85), the ultimate authority.\n\nThe supreme leader and Iran's president are the top figures in the government, which consists of a superstructure of unelected clerical bodies grafted on to an elected executive and legislature. The president has considerable influence. He nominates ministers and chairs the cabinet, heads the national security council, makes economic policy, issues decrees and signs legislation.\n\nElections form the connection between clerics and populace. Turnout determines the legitimacy of the model, which has been challenged repeatedly over the past 45 years. Fear of diminished power or overthrow has prompted the conservatives to take control of the presidency and parliament and clamp down on dissent.\n\nThe clerics were shaken in 2022 when nationwide protests erupted after a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died while under arrest by morality police for allegedly failing to wear her headscarf (hijab) as mandated by law. Unrest morphed into a mass movement which adopted the slogan, \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" and rejected the hijab and clerical rule.\n\nIranian human rights groups reported 550 were killed and 12,500 arrested during the security crackdown. This angered educated young Iranians who shunned both the March parliamentary poll, which had 41 per cent turnout, as well as the first round of the presidential poll.", "source": {"uri":

supporters and urged them to vote again next July 5 \"to save the country from poverty, lies, discrimination and injustice.\"\n\n\"I hope your presence will be the basis of a new voice for change in attitude, behaviour, conversation and in the distribution and allocation of resources,\" he added in a video published on the website of the reformist newspaper Etemad.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called for a high turnout ahead of Friday's vote.\n\nOnly slightly more than 40 percent of the 61 million electorate took part - a record low turnout for the Islamic republic - and more than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nThe poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two of them - the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi - dropped out.\n\nAfter the final results were released, they both asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the July 5 runoff.\n\nGhalibaf followed suit, asking \"all revolutionary forces and supporters\" to get behind Jalili's bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, the Guardian Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the election.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nThe vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, the position of the two candidates for the run-off - the first since 2005 - is revealing about public sentiments, the limitations of political labelling, and more significantly, the divergent mood in the establishment.\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, the sole reformist candidate allowed in the race after being debarred in 2021, secured first place with 10.41 million votes, ahead of his ultra-conservative rival and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, with 9.47 million, out of the 24.5 million votes cast, or just about 40 per cent of the 61 million-odd electorate.\n\nSurprisingly, Majles Speaker and former Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, whom some polls had tipped as a prime contender over both Pezeshkian and Jalili, was the distant third with 3.38 million votes, while, the only cleric in the contest, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, had to be content with 206,397 votes\n\nTehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and Vice President Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi - both conservatives - had quit days before Friday's election.\n\nThe vote count suggests that the combined votes of the conservatives in the run-off next Friday will be enough to propel Jalili to victory - unless more voters from the widely disenchanted abstaining majority jettison their apathy and head to the polling booths to support Pezeshkian.\n\nIn the present instance, appeals for support to him by former Presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hasan Rouhani and former Foreign Minister Javed Zarif did not seem to have been enough to galvanise the reformist-leaning vote.\n\nWhile Qalibaf, Zakani and Ghazizadeh have now asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the run-off in order to ensure victory for the \"revolution front\", Pourmohammadi's response was more meaningful and nuanced.\n\n\"Greetings to all of you who came to vote on June 29, and respect to all of you who did not believe us and did not come. Your presence and absence are full of messages that I hope will be heard. Your message is clear and unambiguous,\" he said in a social media message.\n\nIn fact, Pourmohammadi, who though deemed a conservative and targetted for his role in extrajudicial executions in the 1980s - along with late President Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a helicopter crash last month, caused the election, surprised people with his disapproval of internet bans. He also batted for more women's participation in the Majles.\n\nHis stand may be seen as unexpected not unprecedented - since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran had eight Presidents, out of which five were clerics, spanning from hardline conservatives (current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Raisi), to moderative conservative (Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani), to reformists (Mohammad Khatami and Hasan Rouhani).\n\nOn the other hand, the relative performances of Jalili, an acknowledged hardliner and Qalibaf, who sought to portray himself as a more pragmatic conservative - or the fact that both remained in the contest, raises some interesting questions.\n\nJalili, who had contested the 2013 poll but lost to Rouhani and filed nominations in 2021 where he withdrew in favour of Raisi, and Qalibaf, who was also a rather perennial Presidential candidate (2005, 2013, 2017), like former IRGC commander Mohsen Rezaee (2005, 2009, 2013, 2021), have many similarities.\n\nBoth are close to Supreme Leader Khamenei and the IRGC and have extensive security credentials with Jalili being a nuclear deal negotiator and currently the Supreme Leader's representative to the Supreme National Security Council, while Qalibaf was a former commander of the IRGC air force and then, the country's chief of police.\n\nHowever, Qalibaf, who secured the endorsement of prominent security establishment figures like Major General Rezaee (retd) and former Defence Minister and navy chief, Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, among others. ended up securing nearly one-third of the votes that Jalili got, indicating the establishment does not think or operate in a monolith manner. However, the more doctrinaire element seems to be maintaining its predominance over the realistic part.\n\nWith Jalili favourite to win in the run-off as the conservative votes coalesce, it is tempting to view his Presidency as a continuation of the Raisi era as he was a key influence on the late President, but the situation is not so clear-cut.\n\nWhile foreign or nuclear policy may not see many changes under Jalili - or for that matter, under Pezeshkian, for all his rhetoric, given the limitations of the President's role, both have a policy overlap in several domestic issues, particularly, on economic development, welfare and employment creation. However, Pezeshkian is more upfront on social issues, especially the role of the morality police, which he opposes.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen if more reformists, enthused by the prospect of a Pezeshkian win, will turn out.", "source": {"uri": "easternmirrornagaland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eastern Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

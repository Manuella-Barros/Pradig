His siblings have also been visiting and helping out, with the source noting, \"They are all very close.\"\n\nThe accident took place last month on July 29. As per TMZ, law enforcement sources said that Pax was not wearing a helmet while riding an e-bike in a heavy-traffic area on Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m. local time. He reportedly sustained a head injury and hip pain.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that a man in his early 20s was involved in an accident at 5:12 p.m. on July 29 and that a severe traffic collision report was completed.\n\nIn addition to Pax, Jolie and Pitt share five other children: Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.

\"not with malicious intent and with the intent to harm Pitt in response to any potential custody decision\" when she sold her stake in Miraval in 2021.\n\n\"Instead,\" she told the court in the document, \"it was Pitt who refused to purchase her interest unless he received his recently expanded nondisclosure agreement, enforceable by an $8.5 million withholding specifically designed to force

Pax was not wearing a helmet, and when he crashed into a stopped car, people got out of their cars to help him and call for an ambulance. Apparently, Pax was unconscious for a moment after the crash, according to eyewitnesses. He was admitted to the hospital and Angelina Jolie was by his side throughout his hospitalization. Which only just ended - Pax has now been released and according to People Mag, he faces a lengthy recovery and rehab.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's son Pax is on the mend. Days after the 20-year-old was hospitalized following an e-bike accident in Los Angeles, he has been released from the ICU, a source tells PEOPLE exclusively.\n\n\"Pax has been released from the ICU. He suffered complex trauma, and now begins the long road of recovery and physical therapy,\" the source says.\n\nThe source adds that Pax and his mother -- who was by his side as he recovered in the hospital -- \"are deeply grateful for the quick and life-saving action of first responders, and the outstanding medical care he received.\"\n\nJolie, 49, continues to be with her son, the source notes, as do his siblings, who \"have been visiting and helping,\" the insider says. \"They are all very close.\"\n\nPax was hospitalized after the accident on Monday, July 29.\n\nAccording to TMZ, law enforcement sources told the outlet that Pax was not wearing a helmet while riding an e-bike in a heavy-traffic area on Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m. local time, when the accident happened. He reportedly sustained a head injury and hip pain, TMZ said.\n\n[From People]\n\nThis was much more serious than many of us originally thought. I believed his hospitalization was mostly due to a concussion and possible minor brain bleed, but \"complex trauma\" indicates that this was really, really bad. Best wishes to Pax and the Jolie fam - I'm sure Angelina is stressed the f-k out.\n\nMeanwhile, last week, a \"source close to Brad Pitt\" described Pitt as \"distraught\" over Pax's accident but admitted that Pitt couldn't even speak to his kids because they don't take his calls: \"It is very upsetting to Brad whenever he hears of one of the kids being hurt and he feels completely powerless because there is nothing that he can do at all. A father's inclination would be to go to the hospital, or to call him. He's tried so many times but the kids won't take his calls. His hands are tied. Brad doesn't think that Pax should be driving a scooter without a helmet to begin with - he should have been in a car.\" Father-of-the-year over here! His kids won't take his calls so he runs to the Mail to bitch about Angelina not being able to force a 20-year-old into wearing a helmet.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Albin_Pax", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Albin Pax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789377", "eventUri": "eng-9789377", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1331, "textEnd": 1338}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

They're worried.\"\n\nAnother source in the know told us it's not just bikes that Pax had crashed, but also cars.\n\n\"He has had a string of car crashes,\" the source claimed. \"It's not great. Pax is a troubled kid, and Angelina is doing her best to help him.\"\n\nPage Six has reached out to reps for Jolie for comment.\n\nPax -- who still lives at Jolie's sprawling $US25 million ($A38 million) Los Feliz estate, once the home of legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille -- was spotted riding around the neighbourhood on a $US3,000 ($A4600) Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike on July 11, without a helmet.\n\nAccording to the Talaria website, the Sting R MX4 is an off-road bike. Vendor sites such as REVRides.com specify the $US4,500 ($A7000) bike is \"not for street use.\"\n\nThe LAPD incident report for a road accident matching the particulars of Pax's July 29 accident does not specify the make and model of his bike. Asked if Pax could face any charges, LAPD sources told Page Six Friday that there was nothing new to add to the initial report of a traffic collision.\n\nPax was adopted by Oscar winner Jolie from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh city in Vietnam when he was three.\n\nHis birth mother, a woman named Pham Thu Dung who struggled with heroin addiction, reportedly abandoned her son two days after giving birth.\n\nHe is extremely close to Jolie, as are his five siblings, Maddox, 23; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, who turned 16 last month.\n\nMaddox was adopted by Jolie from Cambodia in 2002. The star then adopted Zahara from Ethiopia in 2005 and Pax in 2007. Jolie's boyfriend and future husband Brad Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara in 2006, followed by Pax in 2008.\n\nAs we have previously reported, the six children basically now have no relationship with Pitt.\n\nAll the children were homeschooled, sources confirm, with some saying this is a major reason for their fractured relations with Pitt.\n\n\"Angelina homeschooled them, she cocooned them, and this was one way to alienate them from Brad,\" said a Pitt insider.\n\nPitt and Jolie have been embroiled in a bitter eight-year divorce that is still ongoing and includes a custody battle over their two remaining minor children.\n\nThe 60-year-old \"Ocean's Eleven\" actor has been estranged from Maddox, Pax and Zahara since he was accused of hitting one of his children during an altercation on a private jet with Jolie in 2016, prompting her to file for divorce.\n\nFollowing an FBI investigation into the incident, the Oscar winner was never arrested or charged with any offence.\n\nHe has not spoken to Pax since his accident, we're told. Reps for Pitt were unavailable for comment.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracerebral_hemorrhage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intracerebral hemorrhage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sting (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cecil B.

However, it turns out that he's still in the hospital until now, sparking fears that the accident might be a little more serious than first thought.\n\n\"His friends are concerned about him,\" a source told the news outlet, adding that Pax has \"been reckless\" and that friends are \"worried.\"\n\n\"He has had a string of car crashes,\" the insider continued. \"It's not great. Pax is a troubled kid, and Angelina is doing her best to help him.\"\n\nPax Jolie-Pitt Has Not Been Charged For Any Crime After The Bike Crash Incident\n\nAccording to the news outlet, LAPD sources remained mute on the possibility of Pax facing charges, claiming there's nothing more to add other than the initial reports of a traffic collision.\n\nCalifornia's mandatory helmet law, as written in Vehicle Code Section 27803, states that it is \"unlawful to operate a motorcycle, motor-driven cycle, or motorized bicycle if the driver or any passenger is not wearing a safety helmet.\"\n\nPax, who was born in Vietnam and adopted by Jolie at age three, didn't wear a helmet when the nasty collision occurred.\n\nMedics initially feared he'd suffered a brain bleed at the time they first responded to him on the accident scene as he reportedly complained of a hip injury and pain in the head.\n\nBrad Pitt Was 'Distraught' He Couldn't Reach His Son\n\nIt's not known if Pitt has been able to get across to his estranged son, but the actor was reportedly left angry as he wasn't able to reach out to him after learning of his accident.\n\nHis relationship with Pax and several of his other children soured following an alleged incident between him and Jolie on a private airplane in 2016.\n\n\"Brad is distraught and worried over Pax's accident, but he is unable to reach him,\" a source told the Daily Mail. \"It is very upsetting to Brad whenever he hears of one of the kids being hurt, and he feels completely powerless because there is nothing that he can do at all.\"\n\n\"A father's inclination would be to go to the hospital or to call him. He's tried so many times but the kids won't take his calls. His hands are tied,\" the source continued.\n\n\"Brad doesn't think that Pax should be driving a scooter without a helmet to begin with - he should have been in a car,\" the insider added, subtly taking a swipe at Jolie.\n\nPax Jolie-Pitt Slammed Brad Pitt In An Online Message\n\nFour years ago, Pax slammed his father in a bitter online message for Father's Day celebration, calling the \"Bullet Train\" actor an \"a-hole\" and an \"awful human being.\"\n\n\"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence,\" Pax allegedly wrote.\n\n\"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so. You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father's Day, you f-cking awful human being,\" Pax added.\n\nBrad Pitt Has A Strained Relationship With All His Kids\n\nSome of Pitt's children have seemingly dropped his last name, and his biological daughter, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, is taking things a step further by trying to make her name change legal.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor is also understood to have a \"non-existent\" relationship with his older kids.\n\nPitt's lengthy court battle with Jolie over the sale of her shares in the Chateau Miraval winery has also not helped to heal their family rift.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

His siblings have also been visiting and helping out, with the source noting, \"They are all very close.\"\n\nThe accident took place last month on July 29.\n\nAs per TMZ, law enforcement sources said that Pax was not wearing a helmet while riding an e-bike in a heavy-traffic area on Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m. local time. He reportedly sustained a head injury and hip pain.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that a man in his early 20s was involved in an accident at 5:12 p.m. on July 29 and that a severe traffic collision report was completed.\n\nIn addition to Pax, Jolie and Pitt share five other children: Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nThe family remains close-knit as they support Pax during his recovery, reported PEOPLE.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nShow full article\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.

He suffered complex trauma, and now begins the long road of recovery and physical therapy.'\n\nThe insider added that Pax and Angelina, 49, 'are deeply grateful for the quick and life-saving action of first responders, and the outstanding medical care he received.'\n\nThe Oscar winner remains by her son's side, as well as his other siblings, with the source noting they 'have been visiting and helping', and adding, 'They are all very close.'\n\nAs for Pax's estranged father Brad, a rep for the 60-year-old actor declined to comment when asked by DailyMail.com if he planned to visit his son in hospital.\n\nIt comes following claims that the actress is reportedly seeking help for her 'troubled' son.\n\nAngelina has been by Pax's side at the hospital since he crashed into a car during rush hour in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles on Monday, July 29.\n\nHe was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.\n\nA source told TMZ on Tuesday that witnesses who lived nearby initially believed Pax had died in the crash as they discovered him lying lifeless on the ground.\n\nIt was not until paramedics arrived at the scene that Pax regained consciousness.\n\nPage Six is reporting that this was not the first time the young man has been involved in incidents involving two and four wheeled vehicles.\n\n'His friends are concerned about him,' an insider told the outlet alleging, 'He's being reckless. They're worried.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for Angelina for comment.\n\n'He has had a string of car crashes,' the source asserted. 'It's not great. Pax is a troubled kid, and Angelina is doing her best to help him.'\n\nThe publication reported that LAPD sources said there was nothing new to add to the initial report of a traffic collision, when asked if charges might be pending.\n\nResponding police and paramedics opted to rush Pax to the hospital after he complained of head pain.\n\nDespite his injuries, TMZ's source claimed that Pax's bike did not show any obvious signs of damage.\n\nPax -- who like several of his other siblings is estranged from his famous father -- had reportedly been driving down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m., which put him on the regularly crowded street during rush hour traffic.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, he had been coming up to an intersection when he crashed his bike into the back of the car, which had already stopped for the red light.\n\nThe car's driver reportedly did their duty by getting out and checking on the injured Pax before police and paramedics arrived.\n\nAlthough it's not clear exactly where he collided with the car, witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nIn recent months, Pax has been spotted around Los Angeles riding on a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike, which costs around $3,000, though it's not known if that was the same bike he crashed.\n\nHe was most recently pictured on the dirt bike on July 11.\n\nNotably, he wasn't wearing a helmet when he was pictured riding the bike in public.\n\nCalifornia state laws require all bike and motorcycle riders under 18 to wear helmets, but it's unclear if the type of bike Pax was riding at the time would have required him to wear a helmet.\n\nThe crash also reportedly took place on a street near Angelina's Los Angeles residence.\n\nAngelina rushed to the hospital to be by her son's beside following the crash.\n\nPax, who was born in Vietnam, was adopted by Jolie at age three, joining siblings Maddox, 22, and Zahara, 19.\n\nHe is reportedly close to them as well as siblings Shiloh, 18, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16.\n\nMaddox and Zahara were adopted by Jolie's then-partner, Brad, in 2005 and he adopted Pax in 2008.\n\nAll three of the older children have been estranged from Pitt following an incident on a private airplane in 2016, when the actor allegedly hit one of his children.\n\nNo charges were filed after an investigation into the alleged incident.\n\nJolie and Pitt are legally divorced but are still fighting over the sale of Miraval, the vineyard in France.\n\nOn Thursday, the Eternals star accused Pitt of trying to have her sign a $8.5 million non-disclosure agreement related to her allegations of abuse, according to People.\n\n'In the court paper, the Maleficent star asserted she 'was not acting with malice and the intent to hurt Pitt in response to any custody ruling' when she sold her share of Miraval in 2021.\n\n'Instead,' she told the court in the filing, 'it was Pitt who refused to buy her interest unless he received his newly expanded NDA, enforceable by an $8.5 million holdback specifically designed to force her silence about his abuse and cover-up.'", "source":

The 20-year-old is now looking at a \"long road to recovery\" after the chilling accident, a source close to the family has shared.\n\nThe insider stated: \"Pax has been released from the ICU. He suffered complex trauma and is now starting a long journey of recovery and physical therapy.\" The same source informed PEOPLE that Pax, together with his star mother, who did not leave his side during his time in hospital, \"are profoundly thankful for the swift, life-saving response of the first responders and the excellent medical care he received.\"\n\nAngelina, 49, continues to stay by her son's bedside, and his brothers and sisters have been regular visitors, providing much-needed moral support, the source continued. \"They are all very close.\" Earlier this week, Pax made it into the news as he was rushed to the emergency room following a severe head injury incurred during the terrifying accident.\n\nLaw enforcement sources report that around 5 pm, Pax crashed into the rear of a car. Paramedics rushed Pax to hospital amid fears he was suffering from a brain bleed after he complained of head pain following a collision. The incident occurred as Pax, who wasn't wearing a helmet, was riding down Los Feliz Boulevard and hit the rear of a stationary car at a red light.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources speaking to TMZ, the accident happened during rush hour traffic while Pax was on his electric bike. The driver of the car reportedly checked on Pax before paramedics and police arrived.\n\nWitnesses told TMZ that Pax complained of hip pain as well as head pain. Prior to the accident, Pax had been spotted around Los Angeles on a Talaria Sting R MX4 electric bike, but it's not known if this was the same bike involved in the crash.\n\nA source close to Pax told Page Six that his friends are worried about his \"reckless\" biking habits. \"His friends are concerned about him,\" the insider revealed. \"He's being reckless.

His hands are tied,\" the source continued.\n\n\"Brad doesn't think that Pax should be driving a scooter without a helmet to begin with - he should have been in a car,\" the insider added, subtly taking a swipe at Jolie.\n\nFour years ago, Pax slammed his father in a bitter online message for Father's Day celebration, calling the \"Bullet Train\" actor an \"a-hole\" and an \"awful human being.\"\n\n\"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence,\" Pax allegedly wrote.\n\n\"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so. You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father's Day, you f-cking awful human being,\" Pax added.\n\nSome of Pitt's children have seemingly dropped his last name, and his biological daughter, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, is taking things a step further by trying to make her name change legal.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor is also understood to have a \"non-existent\" relationship with his older kids.\n\nPitt's lengthy court battle with Jolie over the sale of her shares in the Chateau Miraval winery has also not helped to heal their family rift.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors":

On July 29, 2024, at around 5 pm, the 20-year-old was enjoying the city of Los Angeles, riding his e-bike in a heavy-traffic area. However, things soon went out of hand when he approached an intersection on Los Feliz Boulevard. According to reports, Pax rammed into a waiting car, which resulted in a head injury, as he was reportedly not wearing a helmet. Thankfully, paramedics arrived quickly and rushed the young man to the hospital after he complained of head pain.\n\nUpon arrival at the hospital, reports revealed that Angelina Jolie's son Pax was stable. However, he had to stay back at the hospital for further monitoring. Gladly, Pax is on the mend days after his e-bike crash. On Sunday, a source told People that Pax had been released from the ICU.\n\n\"He suffered complex trauma, and now begins the long road of recovery and physical therapy,\" the insider shared.\n\nThey also revealed that Jolie and Pax were \"deeply grateful\" for the first responders' quick and life-saving actions. Overall, the source said the mother and son were thankful for the fantastic medical care Pax received. Meanwhile, although Pax is out of the ICU, reports say he is still in the hospital. His siblings have been visiting and helping, ensuring they stay close during this difficult time.\n\nAlthough Pax seems to be doing well, there are worries he won't learn his lessons.

The Maleficent actress continued, \"It's a part of their life. But it's not important to them and a center of their lives in a way that's unhealthy. It's all fun.\"\n\nShe also told British Vogue in February 2021 that she lacked \"the skills to be a traditional stay-at-home mom.\" She explained, \"I'm managing through it because the children are quite resilient, and they're helping me, but I'm not good at it at all. ... I love them. I feel like we're such a team. It may sound clich\u00e9d, but you love and you try, and even if you burn the eggs, that doesn't matter in the end.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristie_lau_adams@newsobserver.com", "name": "Kristie Lau-Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Pitt the Younger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_&_Glue_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paper & Glue (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maleficent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maleficent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housewife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Housewife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Safety", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/o7i4d/picture290748029/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fadeb06a-3de8-423c-8ba0-232b7550dfea", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789377", "eventUri": "eng-9789377", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 55, "textEnd": 63}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 213, "textEnd": 220}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 1636, "textEnd": 1650}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The 'Embtto' artist, who was adopted by the actress, 49, in 2012 from Vietnam, was rushed to hospital after a witness at the scene initially believed he had died.\n\nPax, who is estranged from his father, Brad Pitt, 60, will reportedly now have a \"long road of recovery\" after suffering a \"complex trauma\". Giving an update on his health, a source said: \"Pax has been released from the ICU. He suffered complex trauma, and now begins the long road of recovery and physical therapy.\"\n\nThe insider added to People that both Pax and Angelina \"are deeply grateful for the quick and life-saving action of first responders, and the outstanding medical care he received\".\n\nThe mum-of-six remains by her son's side, as well as his brothers and sisters, with the source noting they \"have been visiting and helping\", adding: \"They are all very close\".\n\nHowever, Pax's father, Brad, declined to comment when asked by DailyMail.com if he planned to visit his son in hospital. Relations are frayed between the pair after it was reported Brad has \"virtually no contact\" with his adult children.\n\nEarlier this month it was reported that Shiloh Jolie-Pitt had petitioned to legally lose the 'Pitt' from her surname. Brad is said to be \"aware and upset\" of her decision. Meanwhile, in 2020, Pax branded the actor a \"world class a** hole\" on Father's Day. A source within the actor's inner circle has since responded, telling People: \"It's frustrating to see Brad being painted as some kind of 'bad person' when it's far from the truth.\"\n\nPax's crash comes amid claims Angelina is seeking help for her 'troubled' son. According to Page Six, the 20-year-old has been in \"multiple\" e-bike accidents before last Monday's crash and has \"consistently\" ridden without a helmet. \"His friends are concerned about him. He's being reckless. They're worried,\" the source shared last week.\n\nPax, who was adopted from a Vietnamese orphanage near Ho Chi Minh City in 2012, had reportedly been driving down Los Feliz Boulevard around 5 p.m.\n\nAccording to law enforcement sources, he was approaching an intersection when he crashed his bike into the back of the car, which had already stopped for the red light. Witnesses at the scene said he complained of pain in his hip, and they said he appeared to have injured his head in the crash.\n\nFirst responders were reportedly concerned that Pax may have been suffered from bleeding to the brain, so they rushed him to hospital. However, sources later told TMZ that he was in stable condition, although the full extent of his injuries isn't yet clear.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Brad and Angelina's reps for comment.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_johns@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Victoria Johns", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Jolie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orphanage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Feliz, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33394454.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Netflix-Hosts-The-Golden-Globes-After-Party-At-The-Waldorf-Astoria.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789377", "eventUri": "eng-9789377", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He suffered complex trauma, and now begins the long road of recovery and physical therapy,\" the source reportedly said.\n\nThe accident occurred on July 29, TMZ reported.\n\nPax was driving his electric bike in Los Angeles when he crashed into the back of a car, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nParamedics rushed Pax, who was not wearing a helmet, to the hospital after he reportedly complained of head pain.\n\nThe source told People both Pax and Angelina, 49, are \"deeply grateful for the quick and life-saving action of first responders and the outstanding medical care he received.\"\n\nThey added that Pax's siblings \"have been visiting and helping\" during his stay in hospital, adding, \"They are all very close.\"\n\nAngelina shares five other children with ex-husband Brad, 60, including Maddox, 22, Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nPax was adopted by Angelina Jolie during a visit to Vietnam in 2007.\n\nThe Fight Club actor formally adopted Pax in 2008.\n\nAfter Angelina filed for divorce from Brad in 2016, she took full custody of their six children.\n\nHowever, Brad was granted joint custody in May 2021, until Angelina successfully overturned the judge's ruling amid their ongoing custody battle three months later.\n\nCourt documents showed the presiding judge had failed to disclose his business relationships with Brad's lawyers, resulting in an \"ethical breach\" during the proceedings.\n\nThe following year, new details of an alleged altercation between Brad and his oldest son Maddox onboard a private jet in 2016 emerged.\n\nThe incident reportedly occurred two days before Angelina filed for divorce from Brad, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nOn August 17, 2022, leaked FBI documents revealed new details of the fight between Brad, Angelina, and Maddox on that fateful flight between France and Los Angeles six years prior.\n\nAccording to the report, Brad allegedly told Angelina that one of her children \"looked like a f***ing Columbine kid\" and that she was \"ruining the family\".\n\nHis alleged comment was seemingly a reference to the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, when two 12th grade students shot and killed 12 children and a teacher in Colorado.\n\nAngelina also told FBI officers that Brad yelled at her, \"grabbed her by her head\", shook her, \"pushed her into the bathroom wall, and punched the ceiling of the plane multiple times.\n\nShe added that Brad's outburst left their six children, who were between eight and 15 years old at the time, terrified.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Angelina and Brad's daughter Vivienne had dropped her father's surname from her listing in the Playbill for The Outsiders on Broadway.\n\nOn her 18th birthday in May, Shiloh filed court documents to legally remove Brad's last name from her surname, as it was reported Brad was \"devastated by her decision.\"", "source": {"uri":

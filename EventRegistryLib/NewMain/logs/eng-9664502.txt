No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Christian Taylor is now 34 and no sure thing to make the U.S. team in the triple jump. It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months -- three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene -- down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making -- reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nSha'Carri\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4\u00d7100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nThe Next Champ?\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4\u00d7100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4\u00d7400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\n-- Parker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.\n\n-- Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.\n\n-- Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery Mu\n\nIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType":

(AP) -- The endorsement deals have been signed, the commercials have been shot. In some cases, an airline ticket -- maybe for friend or a family member -- has already been purchased.\n\nThere is one more item to scratch off the list before everyone from Sha'Carri Richardson to Noah Lyles to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone embark on their trips to Paris for the Olympics -- and it is not a small detail at all.\n\nThey have to make the team. No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so spots on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn places on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Christian Taylor is now 34 and no sure thing to make the U.S. team in the triple jump. It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months -- three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene -- down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making -- reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nSha'Carri\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nThe Next Champ?\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\n-- Parker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.\n\n-- Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.\n\n-- Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery Mu\n\nIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\n\"We're in a good place,\" Mu said Thursday. \"We're right where both Bobby and I feel confident and happy and satisfied with just being able to come here and compete.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

(AP) - The endorsement deals have been signed, the commercials have been shot. In some cases, an airline ticket - maybe for friend or a family member - has already been purchased.\n\nThere is one more item to scratch off the list before everyone from Sha\u00b4Carri Richardson to Noah Lyles to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone embark on their trips to Paris for the Olympics - and it is not a small detail at all.\n\nThey have to make the team. No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it\u00b4s always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Christian Taylor is now 34 and no sure thing to make the U.S. team in the triple jump. It wasn\u00b4t always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\nFILE - Sha'Carri Richardson, of the United States, celebrates after she crosses the finish line to anchor her team to gold in the Women's 4x100-meters relay final during the World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Aug. 26, 2023. There is one more item to scratch off the list before everyone from Richardson to Noah Lyles to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone embark on their trips to Paris for the Olympics: Making the Olympic team. US track trials start Friday, June21, 2024. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you\u00b4re going to make it.\u00b4 But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women\u00b4s 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months - three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene - down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making - reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She\u00b4ll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women\u00b4s 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica\u00b4s Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men\u00b4s sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It\u00b4s Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track\u00b4s next big star. One way to do it would be to win three - maybe even four - medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix - much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team - for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nIf you haven\u00b4t heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\n- Parker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.\n\n- Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.\n\n- Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men\u00b4s 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu\u00b4s first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America\u00b4s top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nFILE - Silver medalist Noah Lyles, of the United States, stands on the podium of the men's 60 meters during the World Athletics Indoor Championships at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow, Scotland, March 2, 2024.

She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nThe Next Champ?\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\n-- Parker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.\n\n-- Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.\n\n-- Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery Mu\n\nIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

in Tokyo.\n\nShe has few peers in the 100m after picking up gold in Budapest but will have a tougher road in the 200m against Tokyo bronze medallist Gabby Thomas and McKenzie Long, who won the collegiate championship in a world-leading 21.83 this month.\n\nWorld record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone will defend her 400m hurdles Olympic title, sticking to her signature event despite successful forays into the 200m and 400m flat.\n\nOlympic champion Athing Mu has only competed once since her bronze finish at the World Championships last year but is expected to make her season debut in the 800m.\n\nMichael Norman, the 2022 world champion in the 400m, will continue his comeback tour in his signature event after taking time away last year due to injuries.\n\nLatest on

In some cases, an airline ticket -- maybe for friend or a family member -- has already been purchased.\n\nThere is one more item to scratch off the list before everyone from Sha'Carri Richardson to Noah Lyles to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone embark on their trips to Paris for the Olympics -- and it is not a small detail at all.\n\nThey have to make the team. No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIowa DCI: Wall Lake trucker David Schultz's death 'not a homicide' Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Man dies in standoff with authorities in Sac County Former Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Boat speed rule imposed on Okoboji lakes in wake of heavy rains, storms that also led to wastewater discharges Sioux City man pleads not guilty of manslaughter Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Top area softball performers: RSM last unbeaten team; Mentzer, Moreau swinging hot bats Man pleads not guilty in Sioux City fatal hit and run\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Christian Taylor is now 34 and no sure thing to make the U.S. team in the triple jump. It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status.

One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\nParker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds.

Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics.

Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\nParker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery MuIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\nParker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery MuIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries.

She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

In some cases, an airline ticket -- maybe for friend or a family member -- has already been purchased.\n\nThere is one more item to scratch off the list before everyone from Sha'Carri Richardson to Noah Lyles to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone embark on their trips to Paris for the Olympics -- and it is not a small detail at all.\n\nThey have to make the team. No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nPizza Hut restaurants abruptly close across Northwest Indiana after franchisee is accused of defaulting on payments Davich: Pizza Hut manager's first clue of abrupt closing: 'Fatal error' NWI Business Ins and Outs: True BBQ closed; Birdie's Diner, Next Door at Birdie's, Broad Street Tavern, Whihala Ice Cream, Lenny's Coal-Fired Pizza and Beauty and the Bronze opening Overnight closures of Northwest Indiana's Pizza Huts were years in the making, court records show Family of Crown Point ironworker sues after 100-floot plunge at University of Chicago Hospital, faced with 'life-altering, catastrophic injuries' Downtown Valparaiso has been named a quiet zone Lake Central outlasts Mooresville to win second state title Downtown, racetrack, Kennedy Avenue projects moving ahead in Schererville Crown Point man, 73, sent to prison over his role in Jan. 6 Capitol breach, feds say Franciscan Health building a $185.5 million, five-story hospital addition in Munster Portage police shoot man with gun; investigation underway, county says Second person dies in wake of alleged OWI crash; charge enhanced, records show Man dead after being burned Monday in garage fire, officials say Pedestrian struck in fatal crash identified by coroner New stores open at Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Christian Taylor is now 34 and no sure thing to make the U.S. team in the triple jump. It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months -- three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene -- down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making -- reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nSha'Carri\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nThe Next Champ?\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\nParker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds.

The top three finishers will advance to the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. track and field team is one of the toughest rosters to make in the world. USA TODAY Sports identifies the athletes to watch throughout the trials in Eugene.\n\nNoah Lyles\n\nLyles isn't shy about his desire to be the face of track and field.\n\n\"Anything I do, I want to do to the best of my ability,\" Lyles said to USA TODAY Sports. \"Just as much as I want to be the best at track and field, I also want to be the most recognized athlete in track and field.\"\n\nIn order for Lyles to stake his claim as the face of men's track and field, he has to come up golden at the Olympics. But the first order of business is for Lyles to make this year's U.S. Olympic team. Lyles is the prohibitive favorite in the 200 meters and among the top contenders in the 100, along with Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles is the reigning world champion in the 100 and 200 meters. His personal-best time of 19.31 in the 200 is an American record. His top time in the 100 is 9.83.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone\n\nThe most decorated track and field athlete on the women's side, McLaughlin-Levrone is the reigning Olympic champion in the 400-meter hurdles and the world-record holder, with an impressive time of 50.68. She's the only woman in history to run sub-51 in the event.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone qualified to run in the 200, 400 and 400-meter hurdles at the Olympic trials, but she opted to focus on her best event.\n\n\"The 400 hurdles is my bread and butter. That's what I'm most comfortable with,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said. \"Stick to one event and try to do it the best I can.\"\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone might flirt with the idea of running in multiple events in the future, but her decision to put her attention solely on the 400-meter hurdles is bad news for the other competitors.\n\nRichardson made international news in the aftermath of the previous Olympic trials due to a one-month suspension after testing positive for THC. A few years later, Richardson proclaim, \"I'm not back, I'm better.\"\n\nRichardson is coming off a world championship title in the 100 and a bronze medal in the 200. Her strong 2023 has carried over into this season.\n\nRichardson beat a strong group of women in the 100 at the Prefontaine Classic last month. Her season-best of 10.83 is the third fastest time in the world this year.\n\nThe 24-year-old sprinter is vying for her first Olympics. She is the gold-medal favorite in the 100, but will have to hold off the likes of Aleia Hobbs, Jacious Sears and McKenzie Long.\n\nGabby Thomas has the top-seeded time in the 200, but Richardson could also make the U.S. squad in her secondary event.\n\nThe most dominant athlete on the men's side, Crouser staked claim as the best shot putter of all time. Crouser's personal-best of 77 feet, 3\u00be inches is the world record. He owns the top four shot put marks ever.\n\nCrouser is the heavy favorite to win gold in the men's shot put at the Olympic trials. He's won gold at two consecutive Olympics. The 31-year-old could became the first shot putter in Olympic history to win gold at three straight Olympics.\n\nAt the Toyko Olympics, Mu became the first American woman to win an Olympic gold medal in the 800 since Madeline Manning did it at the 1968 Mexico City games. Mu then followed up her Olympic performance by winning a world championship title in the 800 in 2022. However, the American middle-distance runner hasn't been as dominant since then. She placed third at the 2023 world championships and scratched out of last month's Prefontaine Classic due to a sore hamstring.\n\nDespite a quiet 2024 campaign, all eyes will be on Mu when she runs the 800 in Eugene. McLaughlin-Levrone, Richardson and Mu are the stars of U.S. track and field on the women's side.\n\nMu's U.S. trials 800 qualifying time of 1:54.97 is nearly three seconds better than the next best competitor. The American-record holder in the event looks to reclaim her status as the top 800-meter runner in the world.\n\nHolloway's won three straight world championship gold medals in the 110-meter hurdles, but he's still chasing an Olympic gold medal. The U.S. hurdler is looking to make the Olympic team after finishing second at the Tokyo Games.\n\nHolloway enters the trials with a season-best time of 13.03, which is the top time in the world this year. The 26-year-old has the only entry under 13 seconds at the U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nIf Holloway clears all the hurdles cleanly, he'll likely be on his way to Paris.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com",

No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months -- three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene -- down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making -- reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nSha'Carri\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nThe Next Champ?\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\nParker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery MuIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track.

No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Christian Taylor is now 34 and no sure thing to make the U.S. team in the triple jump. It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months -- three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene -- down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making -- reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\n-- Parker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.\n\n-- Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.\n\n-- Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com",

The top three finishers will advance to the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. track and field team is one of the toughest rosters to make in the world. USA TODAY Sports identifies the athletes to watch throughout the trials in Eugene.\n\nLyles isn't shy about his desire to be the face of track and field.\n\n\"Anything I do, I want to do to the best of my ability,\" Lyles said to USA TODAY Sports. \"Just as much as I want to be the best at track and field, I also want to be the most recognized athlete in track and field.\"\n\nIn order for Lyles to stake his claim as the face of men's track and field, he has to come up golden at the Olympics. But the first order of business is for Lyles to make this year's U.S. Olympic team. Lyles is the prohibitive favorite in the 200 meters and among the top contenders in the 100, along with Christian Coleman and Fred Kerley.\n\nLyles is the reigning world champion in the 100 and 200 meters. His personal-best time of 19.31 in the 200 is an American record. His top time in the 100 is 9.83.\n\nThe most decorated track and field athlete on the women's side, McLaughlin-Levrone is the reigning Olympic champion in the 400-meter hurdles and the world-record holder, with an impressive time of 50.68. She's the only woman in history to run sub-51 in the event.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone qualified to run in the 200, 400 and 400-meter hurdles at the Olympic trials, but she opted to focus on her best event.\n\n\"The 400 hurdles is my bread and butter. That's what I'm most comfortable with,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said. \"Stick to one event and try to do it the best I can.\"\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone might flirt with the idea of running in multiple events in the future, but her decision to put her attention solely on the 400-meter hurdles is bad news for the other competitors.\n\nEvents: 100, 200\n\nRichardson made international news in the aftermath of the previous Olympic trials due to a one-month suspension after testing positive for THC. A few years later, Richardson proclaim, \"I'm not back, I'm better.\"\n\nRichardson is coming off a world championship title in the 100 and a bronze medal in the 200. Her strong 2023 has carried over into this season.\n\nRichardson beat a strong group of women in the 100 at the Prefontaine Classic last month. Her season-best of 10.83 is the third fastest time in the world this year.\n\nThe 24-year-old sprinter is vying for her first Olympics. She is the gold-medal favorite in the 100, but will have to hold off the likes of Aleia Hobbs, Jacious Sears and McKenzie Long.\n\nGabby Thomas has the top-seeded time in the 200, but Richardson could also make the U.S. squad in her secondary event.\n\nEvent: Shot put\n\nThe most dominant athlete on the men's side, Crouser staked claim as the best shot putter of all time. Crouser's personal-best of 77 feet, 3\u00be inches is the world record. He owns the top four shot put marks ever.\n\nCrouser is the heavy favorite to win gold in the men's shot put at the Olympic trials. He's won gold at two consecutive Olympics. The 31-year-old could became the first shot putter in Olympic history to win gold at three straight Olympics.\n\nEvent: 800\n\nAt the Toyko Olympics, Mu became the first American woman to win an Olympic gold medal in the 800 since Madeline Manning did it at the 1968 Mexico City games. Mu then followed up her Olympic performance by winning a world championship title in the 800 in 2022. However, the American middle-distance runner hasn't been as dominant since then. She placed third at the 2023 world championships and scratched out of last month's Prefontaine Classic due to a sore hamstring.\n\nDespite a quiet 2024 campaign, all eyes will be on Mu when she runs the 800 in Eugene. McLaughlin-Levrone, Richardson and Mu are the stars of U.S. track and field on the women's side.\n\nMu's U.S. trials 800 qualifying time of 1:54.97 is nearly three seconds better than the next best competitor. The American-record holder in the event looks to reclaim her status as the top 800-meter runner in the world.\n\nEvent: 110 hurdles\n\nHolloway's won three straight world championship gold medals in the 110-meter hurdles, but he's still chasing an Olympic gold medal. The U.S. hurdler is looking to make the Olympic team after finishing second at the Tokyo Games.\n\nHolloway enters the trials with a season-best time of 13.03, which is the top time in the world this year. The 26-year-old has the only entry under 13 seconds at the U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nIf Holloway clears all the hurdles cleanly, he'll likely be on his way to Paris.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler

She also claimed the bronze at Worlds in the 200m, and will look to qualify for the Olympic team in both sprint events in Eugene.\n\nExcellence has followed McLaughlin-Levrone every time she's touched the track in 2024 after a knee issue forced her out of Worlds last year. She threw down world leads for 2024 in both the 400m and 400m hurdles in her respective season debuts for each event, while also impressing last month in the 200m.\n\nShe'll compete in only the

In some cases, an airline ticket -- maybe for friend or a family member -- has already been purchased.\n\nThere is one more item to scratch off the list before everyone from Sha'Carri Richardson to Noah Lyles to Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone embark on their trips to Paris for the Olympics -- and it is not a small detail at all.\n\nThey have to make the team. No athlete, no matter how well-known or successful in the past, gets a free ride at U.S. Olympic track and field trials, which open Friday and are the only place where the 120 or so places on the team heading to Paris can officially be earned.\n\nThe top three in every event earn spots on the team, assuming they have met the Olympic standard for that event.\n\n\"I feel like trials is always a good time to figure out what the rounds look like and the fitness is at,\" said McLaughlin-Levrone who, even as the world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles, still has to earn her way. \"We have some time still before Paris, but it's always the hardest team to make, so obviously, got to go out there and put on a performance first.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It wasn't always that way. He won every gold medal at the Olympics and worlds from 2011-2019. Then, like now, nobody handed him anything when he walked into Hayward Field in Eugene with a spot on the line.\n\n\"I always felt like I had so much to lose because everyone expected it,\" Taylor said. \"Everyone was like, 'Of course you're going to make it.' But you cannot take the U.S. team for granted.\"\n\nThe trials run June 21-30 on the University of Oregon campus.\n\nStars and Studs\n\nA growing debate in track is whether the 100 meters, which crowns the fastest man and woman in the world, is being supplanted by the 400-meter hurdles as the most electric race on the program.\n\nThat answer might not be fully fleshed out until after the Olympics. Richardson, Lyles and McLaughlin-Levrone will all have a very big say in how things play out.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has helped lift the women's 400-meter hurdles into must-watch status. She has lowered the world record four times over the past 36 months -- three of those occasions came on the track in Eugene -- down to a once-unthinkable mark of 50.68 seconds.\n\nShe also has a potential rival in the making -- reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands, who finished second to McLaughlin-Levrone at the world championships in 2022 and third, also behind 2016 Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, at the Olympics the year before that.\n\nSha'Carri\n\nRichardson might be the biggest name in Eugene over these 10 days.\n\nThree years after a positive test for marijuana kept her out of the Olympics (after she had won the 100 meters at trials), she is back and looks to be in top form. She'll try for the 100 and 200, and would be a shoo-in for the women's 4x100 relay team.\n\nWhat transpires at Jamaica's Olympic trials from June 27-30 will dictate the story in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time defending champion at 100 and 200 meters whose health is in question, would all be considered contenders for Olympic gold if they make their team.\n\nThe Next Champ?\n\nLyles is headlining in a new Netflix documentary that takes an inside look at track. Like Richardson, he has also been hard to miss on NBC or anywhere an Olympic ad campaign is taking place.\n\nThe men's sprint game has struggled to stay in the spotlight since Usain Bolt left this sport after the Rio Games in 2016. Quick, name the defending 100-meter Olympic champion: It's Marcell Jacobs of Italy; American sprinter Fred Kerley finished second.\n\nLyles is positioning himself to be track's next big star. One way to do it would be to win three -- maybe even four -- medals at the Olympics. He won gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay last year at the worlds and has put himself in the mix -- much to the chagrin of some 400-meter runners on the U.S. team -- for the 4x400 relay as well.\n\nUp and Coming\n\nIf you haven't heard of a few of these runners yet, you will soon:\n\nParker Valby, a 21-year-old junior at the University of Florida, recently broke a 14-year-old NCAA record in the 10,000 meters by 28 seconds, finishing in 30 minutes, 50.43 seconds. She is also NCAA record-holder at 5,000 meters and is entered in both events.Ole Miss senior McKenzie Long won NCAA titles at 100 and 200 meters; her time of 21.83 is the fastest in the world this year.Nico Young, a 21-year-old at Northern Arizona, shaved nearly 16 seconds off the men's 10,000-meter college record in March.\n\nMystery MuIf she makes it to the starting line at trials, it will mark defending 800-meter Olympic champion Athing Mu's first race of the year.\n\nShe has been hampered by injuries. Last month, she pulled out of the Prefontaine Classic with what coach Bobby Kersee said was left hamstring soreness.\n\nThe 22-year-old Mu looked like one of America's top stars after winning at the Olympics, then following that with a world title in 2022.\n\nBut she nearly skipped last year's worlds, then conceded she was happy to go on vacation and not have to think about track. She has not raced since winning the 2023 version of the Pre Classic last September.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to

After an injury sidelined her last year, the former world champion will race in the 100 and 200 meter events, the latter being her specialty.\n\nAnavia Battle: The 25-year-old from Michigan raced collegiately at Ohio State and is eyeing a spot in her second Olympics. Battle is also set to race in a loaded 100m and 200m field.\n\nAdelaide Aquilla: The former Buckeye and Strongsville native is looking to make the Olympic shot put team for a second time. Aquilla is a former NCAA champion and placed 20th at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nKatie Moon: Moon, of Lakewood, is the current Olympic and world champion in the pole vault. She could become the first female repeat pole vault gold medalist since 2008.\n\nMicaela Hazlewood: Hazlewood is a volunteer assistant coach at Ohio State and will compete in the discus throw at the trials. She missed the Tokyo games after not reaching the required qualifying distance.\n\nNoah Lyles: The world champion in the 100m and 200m will compete in both sprints. Lyles is trying to become the first American to be declared the fastest man in the world since 2004.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone: The 24-year-old might be Team USA's best athlete in any sport. McLaughlin-Levrone will focus on her specialty the 400m hurdles at trials after scratching out of the 200m and 400m races.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson: The women's 100m world champion has yet to fulfill her Olympic dreams. After winning the 100m race at the 2021 Olympic trials, Richardson tested positive for cannabis after the race and was ineligible to make the team.\n\nChristian Coleman: Lyles' fiercest rival in the sprints will be Christian Coleman. The Atlanta native enters trials with the joint fastest 100m time alongside Lyles and won the world title in 2019.\n\nRai Benjamin: The 26-year-old from New York is the men's star in the 400m hurdles as he chases Olympic glory. Benjamin is aiming for his first individual gold in an Olympic or world championships in the event.\n\nAthing Mu: The defending Tokyo gold medalist in the women's 800m enters as the heavy favorite to win the event at trials. Mu is vying to be the first American woman to win back-to-back 800m Olympic golds.\n\nNBC4 will have live coverage of every evening session of the track and field trials. Because of the three-hour time difference, most track finals will not start until after 9:30 p.m.\n\nMonday, June 23: Women's Hammer Throw, Men's Pole Vault, Men's Javelin Throw, Women's 400m, Men's

No country has amassed more Olympic track and field medals (827), and the US outpaces the next six countries on the all-time list combined (819).\n\nThere are so many talented athletes, but only a select few are allowed to compete at major global championships. For the fifth consecutive time, Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon will host the unforgiving USA Olympic Track and Field Trials. Let's take a closer look at the qualification and selection process for Paris 2024.\n\nA maximum of only three athletes are allowed per country. Unlike the World Athletics Championships, which offers \"wild card\" berths to incumbent world champions (creating a fourth slot for countries), there are no byes into the Olympics.\n\nWorld and Olympic champions and prohibitive gold medal favorites are not spared if they have an off-day at the worst possible time. In 2021, 800-meter world champion Donavan Brazier finished last in the USA finals and did not make the trip to Tokyo. Women's 100 meters hurdles star Keni Harrison, widely expected to win the 2016 Rio Olympic trials, only finished sixth and missed the team. Two weeks later, she would set a new world record, but it was a mere consolation.\n\nThis is also as good a time as any to remind casual track followers that for sprints (100-400 meters), it only takes one false start for a runner to be disqualified from the race.\n\nAll sprint and middle distance (800-1,500 meters) races have three rounds of qualification (Round 1, semifinals, final), whereas long distance (3,000-10,000 meters and race walks) have either two rounds or a direct final.\n\n* - Semifinals and final are contested on the same day.\n\nAll field events have one qualifying round and a final, the decathlon and heptathlon don't have qualifying rounds, and marathon runners already had separate qualifiers in February.\n\nYes. This is where it gets a little complicated for a small percentage of American athletes. Similar to swimming, there are minimum times (or distances for field athletes) that must be met within an Olympic qualifying window. The window for athletes competing in any individual event (except the 10,000 meters, marathon, and race walks) is July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024.\n\nFor example, the women's 5,000 meters Olympic standard is 14:52.00. NCAA champion Parker Valby narrowly missed the standard by 0.2 seconds at this month's NCAA Outdoor Championships. Not only must Valby finish in the top-3 at trials, she also must run at least 14:52.00 to guarantee her spot on the team. And unlike regular track meets, championship competitions do not have pacemakers and wave-light technology to help guide runners to a specific time.\n\nWithout the qualifying standard, the last-ditch effort is placing high enough in the World Athletics rankings system, which is too complicated to explain even in an explainer post. The final rankings list will be published on July 7.\n\nHere's the simplified way to clinch a Team USA Olympic berth:\n\nThis will most likely only affect competitors in disciplines where the Americans have traditionally weaker depth, such as the long-distance races and a handful of field events. Otherwise this won't be a storyline for, say, any of the sprints.\n\nThe next highest-placed athlete goes in their place, provided they also have the qualifying standard or a high enough world ranking.\n\nWhen Sha'Carri Richardson was controversially suspended following a positive marijuana test ahead of the 2020 Olympics, fourth-placed Jenna Prandini replaced her. In the women's high jump, neither Inika McPherson nor Nicole Green achieved the qualifying standard and didn't have a high enough world ranking. They were replaced by fourth-placed Rachel McCoy and Tynita Butts-Townsend, who had the requisite ranking despite not making the final.\n\nThe 2016 men's 20 km race walk team, however, sent no entrants to Rio after none of the top three finishers met the standard or ranking.\n\nNew to the Olympics is the use of the World Athletics Relays as a qualifying competition for major championships. At this year's championship in The Bahamas, the American men's and women's 4x100 and 4x400 teams all qualified, as did the mixed (two men, two women) 4x400 meters squad. A total of 14 countries in each discipline needed to finish in the top-2 in either the qualifying heats or the repechage rounds to qualify for Paris.\n\nPer USA Track and Field guidelines, three of the five competitors for each relay team must be athletes who are entered in their corresponding individual event (e.g. Noah Lyles is entered in the individual 100 meters and therefore will be part of the 4x100 relay team). One reserve/alternate athlete can also be named. The other two selections are made at the discretion of the USATF committee, which includes \"medical or exceptional circumstances\" for a waiver request to be granted.\n\nThis is why it's common (at least for Team USA) to have relay runners who did not compete in the individual event. Athing Mu, who won the 800 meters in Tokyo, joined the women's 4x400m relay team and picked up another gold.\n\nIt's worth keeping an eye on the relay selection pool this year for the men's 4x400 meters, as there's a possibility that Noah Lyles could be picked despite not being entered in the 400 at Olympic trials and scarcely running the 400 throughout his career. His indoor relay inclusion was already meant with some divided opinion.\n\nTeam USA trials run from Friday, June 21 through Sunday, June 30 on NBC, USA, and Peacock. The track and field portion of the Olympics commences on August 1 and ends on August 11.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

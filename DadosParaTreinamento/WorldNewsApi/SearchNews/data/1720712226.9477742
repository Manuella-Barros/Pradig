The honour was originally bestowed on the 'I'll Be Missing You' singer in 2014. However, the historically black institution announced unanimously that its board of trustees had voted to rescind his degree. The board stated: \"The Howard University Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to accept the return by Mr. Sean Combs of the honorary degree conferred upon him in 2014. This acceptance revokes all honours and privileges associated with the degree. Accordingly, the Board has directed that his name be removed from all documents listing honorary degree recipients of Howard University.\" For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

The statement read: \"No payments toward the $1 million pledge have been due or made by the Sean Combs Foundation as of this date, therefore no funds are due to be returned under the 2023 pledge agreement.\" Following the release of a video by CNN showing Diddy in an altercation with Cassie, he took to Instagram to apologise for his actions, admitting they were indefensible. He expressed remorse, stating: \"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that.\" Continuing with a candid confession, Diddy added: \"I was f***** up - I hit rock bottom - but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\" Despite facing several lawsuits accusing him of sexual misconduct in recent times, Diddy has consistently denied all such claims against him. *Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs has had his honorary degree from Howard University revoked after video footage emerged of him attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/howard-university-revokes-diddys-honorary-32992191", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/article32992188.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_sean-diddy-combs-has-had-his-honorary-degree-revoked.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:01:33", "author": "Mollie Quirk,Mollie-Quirk", "authors": ["Mollie Quirk", "Mollie-Quirk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.364}

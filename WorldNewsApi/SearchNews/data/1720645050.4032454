O\u2019Donnell called it the \u201cstuff of dreams\u201d after getting his medal, while Adeleke said having the huge Irish support present brought them \u201cso much motivation\u201d, adding: \u201cIt gives us hopes for the rest of the championships. This is a very good starting point.\u201d The night before, they\u2019d turned in one of the great performances in Irish athletics history, winning the mixed 4x400m relay in a blazing time of 3:09.92, just one second shy of the world record and the sixth fastest time in history. In the 90-year history of the European Championships, across 25 previous editions, only one athlete \u2013 Sonia O\u2019Sullivan \u2013 had ever won gold for Ireland. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d said Barr shortly after the ceremony. \u201cI thought my days of standing on podiums were possibly over but with the help of this team, we managed to get to the top of the podium, hear Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann ringing out and having a heavy gold medal around our necks and calling ourselves European champions, that\u2019s not going to get old anytime soon.\u201d All will be in action in individual events in the coming days, with Adeleke and Mawdsley holding big medal chances in Monday night\u2019s women\u2019s 400m final, assuming they advance from tomorrow\u2019s semi-finals. But for today, the focus was on enjoying the reward for their three-minute, nine-second exhibition of relay brilliance, which had been many years in the making. \u201cOnce Ireland are here, they always show up,\u201d said Mawdsley. \u201cTo step on the podium and hear Ireland announced as winners was something special, something I\u2019ll remember for the rest of my life.\u201d Irish in action, Saturday (all times Irish) 17:00: Oisin Lane, men\u2019s 20km race walk 19:12: Sarah Lavin, women\u2019s 100m hurdles semi-final 20:10: Israel Olatunde, men\u2019s 100m semi-final 21:08: *Sarah Lavin, women\u2019s 100m hurdles final 21:28: Brian Fay, men\u2019s 5000m 21:53: *Israel Olatunde, men\u2019s 100m final *pending qualification Live: RT\u00c9 Two, BBC Red Button, Eurovisionsport.com", "summary": "<p>Together they stood, proud as can be, smiling and singing and basking in the golden glow of a rare achievement.

{"id": 232080880, "title": "Jennifer Lopez Steps Out Solo for Dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Los Angeles", "text": "Jennifer Lopez stepped out for some Italian cuisine over the weekend. On Saturday, June 8, the Atlas star was spotted arriving alone at Giorgio Baldi in Los Angeles, opting for a typically stylish ensemble for the outing. In photographs from her outing, the 54-year-old multi-hyphenate could be seen wearing an elegant cream knit dress with loose long sleeves, which she teamed with a light gray purse and chunky peep-toe heels. Lopez wore her hair tied back and completed the chic look with large gold hoop earrings and her wedding and engagement rings. The outing comes just over a week after Lopez's summer tour, This Is Me... Live, was cancelled as she takes \"time off to be with her children, family and close friends.\" On May 31, Live Nation announced the cancellation of Lopez's summer run of shows, before the \"Jenny From the Block\" singer herself updated fans via her OntheJLo website. \"I am completely heartsick and devastated about letting you down. Please know that I wouldn\u2019t do this if I didn\u2019t feel that it was absolutely necessary,\" Lopez wrote at the time. She continued, \"I promise I will make it up to you and we will all be together again. I love you all so much. Until next time\u2026\" Lopez also used her newsletter on June 5 to address what she referred to as \"negativity out in the world\" \u2014 as well as the success of her new sci-fi film Atlas, which recently landed a second week as Netflix's most-watched title, according to Netflix stats. \"I just found out some great news and it\u2019s all because of YOU!! ATLAS is #1 worldwide again this week!!! Thank you all so much,\" she wrote. \"It may seem like there\u2019s a lot of negativity out in the world right now \u2026 but don\u2019t let the voices of a few drown out that there is soooo much love out there,\" she continued. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I love you all so much.\" In the film, Lopez stars as data analyst Atlas Shepherd, with the movie's plot involving \"saving the future of humanity from AI,\" per a synopsis. Lopez also served as a producer on the project \u2014 which also stars Simu Liu, Sterling K. Brown, Gregory James Cohan, Abraham Popoola and more, with direction from Brad Peyton.

Lopez's latest film's success arrives amid speculation about her marriage with Ben Affleck, as sources told PEOPLE in late May that the couple were \"not in the best place\" and had been living separately. The duo appeared together at a basketball game for Affleck's 12-year-old son Samuel on Sunday, June 2 \u2014 as a source shared with PEOPLE that it was \"a good sign they were at the game together.\" The Air actor was also seen with his wedding ring on during an outing on June 8. Lopez and Affleck, 51, were also seen out days before holding hands at Affleck's 18-year-old daughter Violet's high-school graduation ceremony on May 30.", "summary": "The &#39;Atlas&#39; star stepped out in style on Saturday, June 8", "url": "https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-steps-out-solo-for-dinner-at-giorgio-baldi-in-los-angeles-8660576", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/BidWoQW7slLwiYN16v1q_zWTVhI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1033x282:1035x284)/jennifer-lopez-dinner2-060924-d4a9ece3e45e430ab98d14efae40ad24.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:42:47", "author": "Brenton Blanchet", "authors": ["Brenton Blanchet"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.301}

Again just cents separated the baskets from Woolies ($68.23) and Coles ($68.70).\n\nThe undercover shoppers were sent to 81 locations, including 27 Woolworths supermarkets, 27 Coles stores, 23 Aldi shops and 4 IGA stores.\n\nThe stores were located in 27 locations, with mystery shops at IGA taking place when there were no Aldi supermarkets to compete with Coles and Woolworths.\n\nShoppers recorded regular prices as well as special prices, with locations chosen to give coverage of socio-economic status based on ABS indexes.\n\nThe grocery basket consisted of 14 items, 12 of which were packaged products, either a national brand or comparable supermarket brand, with two fresh fruit and vegetable items.\n\nThe items included were: apples, carrot, Weet-Bix, sliced white bread, flour, penne, white sugar, tea bags, tinned diced tomatoes, block of tasty cheese, full cream dairy milk, frozen peas, beef mince and butter.\n\nCHOICE will continue to conduct supermarket price research every quarter for at least the next three years in the hopes of helping shoppers stay on top of where they can find the cheapest groceries.\n\n\"This kind of transparency is more important than ever as the cost of living crisis continues, and prices of basic grocery items climb,\" Mr de Silva said.\n\n\"Competition is the consumer's friend. Economics teaches us that monopolies tend to overcharge and underdeliver.\"\n\nFederal Competition Minister Andrew Leigh said the government welcomed the report.\n\n\"This is about making our supermarkets as competitive as they can be so Australians get the best prices possible,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Australians are under cost-of-living pressure, and we know that a lot of that pressure is piled on at the cash register.\n\n\"This research will help consumers make more informed choices so they can get cheaper prices at the checkout.\"\n\nFormer Labor minister Craig Emerson

At the March's Senate inquiry, fruit and vegetable growers were the most outspoken about the two supermarket giants driving down prices.\n\nJolyon Burnett, from the National Farmers' Federation, said, \"Price matching, if practized by supermarkets, would be an example of a factor other than pure supply and demand influencing the pricing of fresh products.\"\n\nThe findings revealed Aldi's basket of groceries cost an average of AU$51.51, Woolworths at AU$68.58, and Coles basket cost AU$69.33. The mere price difference of less than $1 at the two supermarkets have raised concerns if the big two were competing against each other.\n\n\"We've seen a rise in split-basket shopping during the last couple of years as households have felt cost-of-living pressure ... (which) is going to put more competitive pressure on the majors,\" AAP quoted Competition Minister Andrew Leigh.\n\nAshley de Silva, the chief executive of Choice, said people's locations determined how much they shelled out for groceries. For example, Tasmania and NT faced higher grocery prices due to the lack of Aldi shops.\n\n\"If you live in Tasmania or the Northern Territory, you're paying significantly more each week for your groceries,\" he said. \"However, this is mainly due to the fact that these areas have more limited options for shopping than the rest of the country, with no Aldi in Tassie or the NT.\"\n\nThe federal government has granted AU$1.1 million to Choice to publish quarterly reports for the next three years. The reports will provide insight into price movements of popular items. A federal review had demanded a mandatory code of conduct between supermarkets and suppliers, expected to be finalized by the end of June.\n\nBoth the supermarket majors disputed the research reports.\n\n\"We welcome Choice's contribution, however, it is unclear whether like-for-like products are being compared,\" Coles spokesperson said Thursday. \"Our analysis last week comparing the

New data shows there's only a 75-cent gap", "body": "The impact of Australia's highly concentrated supermarket sector is delivering shoppers a difference of just 75 cents for the same grocery items at Coles and Woolworths check-outs around the country, according to a new report by Choice.\n\nThe report, released by the consumer advocacy group on Thursday, comes as the supermarket giants face ongoing allegations of price gouging to record massive profits, and remain the subject of a number of inquiries.\n\nChoice was commissioned to conduct the reports by the federal government, which gave the organisation $1.1 million in the federal budget to produce a report every three months for three years.\n\nTo conduct its research, Choice sent \"undercover shoppers\" to 81 supermarkets around the country in March to record prices of 14 different products and determine which chain offered the best value for money.\n\nChoice found the average basket of groceries purchased at Aldi cost $51.51 -- approximately 25 per cent less than the same basket of goods at Coles and Woolworths.\n\nThe items at Woolworths cost an average of $68.58, while Coles had the most expensive basket at $69.33 -- meaning there was just 75 cents difference between the two major supermarket chains in Australia.\n\n\"Aldi is the best value when it comes to groceries across the nation,\" Choice CEO Ashley de Silva told The Business.\n\n\"One of the things that we saw is that Aldi's prices across the stores that we visited were reasonably consistent, you get a bit more variation in Coles and Woolworths.\"\n\nHowever, factoring in specials, the cost of items at Woolworths totalled $64.93, while the items at Coles cost $68.52. Choice noted that there were no specials on offer at Aldi at the time of shopping.\n\nMr de Silva said Choice determined its supermarket basket of goods after consulting its supermarket experts, who selected grocery items that are purchased frequently by Australians regardless of where they live.\n\nThe Choice report highlighted that Australians are paying different prices depending on where they live, and people in areas without Aldi stores were often slugged with higher prices at the check-out.\n\n\"For people who aren't near an Aldi, and there's still quite a few of those, it does really matter where you live when it comes to what you pay for groceries at the supermarket,\" Mr de Silva said.\n\n\"For example, places like Tasmania and the NT don't have Aldi stores, so people there by default are going to be paying higher prices. But even in states like WA where Aldi is present, people there on average pay about $1 more for the same basket of goods.\n\n\"It differs too between city and regional areas, so metro folks are paying about 70 cents more for that same basket of goods.\"\n\nIn lieu of Aldi's presence in the Northern Territory and Tasmania, Choice compared grocery prices for 10 items sold at four IGA locations, finding that the items were more expensive compared to Coles and Woolworths. Further analysis on IGA's prices was not conducted in other jurisdictions.\n\nAccording to Choice, Coles and Woolworths combined make up 65 per cent of Australia's supermarket sector. Aldi contributes 10 per cent to the sector, while IGA accounts for 7 per cent.\n\nIn a statement, Aldi said the data from Choice clearly showed its commitment to being \"Australia's most affordable supermarket\" that provided \"high-quality groceries at the lowest possible price\".\n\nRepresentatives for Coles and Woolworths both noted that current prices were available on their respective websites, apps and catalogues, and were committed to delivering competitive prices for their customers.\n\n\"We welcome Choice's contribution, however, it is unclear whether like-for-like products are being compared,\" a Coles spokesperson said.\n\nThe ABC contacted Metcash -- the parent company of IGA -- for comment, but did not receive a response before publication.\n\nChoice said its report compared prices between national brands and comparable supermarket brand or budget brand options.\n\nHowever, the report noted that \"some national brand products will be available at Aldi\" -- specifically Weet-bix and Lipton tea -- and used \"comparable products\" or other items, such as home brand flour.\n\n\"We weren't looking for just the cheapest price, we were really making sure that the products were comparable across what different supermarket chains offered,\" Mr de Silva said.\n\n\"We get into quite a lot of detail around making sure that the sizes are similar, but also even down to the nutrition information to represent quality, so that we really felt like we were comparing fairly.\"\n\nGreens Senator Nick McKim, who recently chaired a Senate inquiry examining the country's supermarket prices, said the findings from Choice were proof that price gouging was taking place.\n\n\"Extraordinarily, there is only around a 1 per cent difference in price on a basket of staple food items between Coles and Woolworths, and that shows that a choice between Coles and Woolworths is basically no choice at all,\" he told The Business.\n\nSenator McKim, who publicly grilled the supermarket bosses as part of the Senate's supermarket inquiry, said the data from Choice was at odds with the evidence the committee heard in April.\n\n\"The CEOs of Coles and Woolworths were really clear in the evidence they gave to the Greens-led supermarket inquiry, that they cross-check their prices with the person they described as their major competition as a regular basis,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, what the Choice data and prices show is that because of that cross-check, there is effectively not a duopoly, but a monopoly in the supermarket sector in Australia.\n\nThe Tasmanian senator said it was disappointing that residents in his home state and in the Northern Territory were being charged more for groceries due to Aldi's absence.\n\n\"It was really disappointing that Aldi said they weren't considering expanding into Tasmania and some other parts around the country because it would give Tasmanians the opportunity to get cheaper food and grocery prices,\" Senator McKim said.\n\n\"But this report is not going to tell Australian shoppers much that they don't already know, and that is Coles and Woolworths are price gouging them, that there is not enough competition in the supermarket sector, and that we need to make price gouging illegal in Australia.\"\n\nAssistant Minister for Competition Andrew Leigh said not only would households benefit from Choice's supermarket price comparison reports, but it would also place greater scrutiny on the supermarket giants themselves.\n\n\"Our supermarket sector is among the most concentrated in the world, and so it's only fair that we have appropriate scrutiny of prices,\" he told The Business.\n\n\"Now, by funding it through the Commonwealth, we've got all that data out in the open, available to everyone.\n\n\"There'll be a supermarket Olympics taking place every three months, judged by Choice, in the interest of Australian shoppers.\"\n\nDr Leigh said the government was hoping that a recurring spotlight on supermarket prices through the publication of the Choice reports for the coming three years will benefit every household.\n\n\"This is setting up a healthy competition between our supermarkets, providing high-level price scrutiny, allowing shoppers to know where they can get a better deal,\" he said.\n\n\"So if there's a race to deliver the best prices for consumers, then Australian shoppers will be the winners.\"\n\nThe Choice reports were part of the government's focus on monitoring the country's supermarket sector, Dr Leigh said, specifically referencing the review into the food and grocery code of conduct by former Labor minister Dr Craig Emerson, which is due to be finalised by the end of June.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is also conducting its own inquiry into supermarket prices, with its interim report due to be handed to the government by the end of August.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

"title": "Australia's cheapest supermarket revealed by new Choice report", "body": "New research has confirmed Aldi is Australia's cheapest supermarket -- but how much do you actually save?\n\nConsumer advocacy group Choice has just released its first \"basket of goods\" report, a new quarterly, government-funded report on supermarket prices across the country.\n\nAs part of the research, Choice sent mystery shoppers to 81 regional and metropolitan supermarkets across the country, including Aldi, Woolworths, and Coles, to record prices for 14 common grocery items.\n\nThe items included apples, carrots, Weet-Bix, sliced white bread, flour, penne pasta, white sugar, tea bags, tinned diced tomatoes, a block of tasty cheese, full-cream dairy milk, frozen peas, beef mince and butter.\n\nThe research revealed that Aldi's basket was about 25 per cent cheaper than baskets bought at Coles or Woolworths, saving the consumer around $17.\n\n\"Aldi was the clear leader on value for money in our first supermarket basket survey for 2024, with our basket of 14 products costing just $51.51 - coming in at about 25% cheaper than Coles or Woolworths,\" the watchdog's CEO, Ashley de Silva, said.\n\n\"Grocery prices at Coles and Woolworths are very closely matched, with only 75 cents separating the prices of our basket of 14 items without specials.\n\nColes was the most expensive at $69.33, while the basket at Woolworths came in at $68.58.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the federal government as part of its action on supermarket pricing.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier this year announced a review into the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, warning supermarkets to pass on any savings they make from suppliers to consumers.\n\nThe code is currently voluntary, an interim report called for it to be made mandatory, which would result in huge financial penalties on supermarkets with annual revenues above $5bn that breach the agreement.\n\nThe final review is reportedly expected this later week.\n\nThe results were measured from March this year and were published by Choice after the consumer group received $1.1 million in federal government funding over three years to help inform shoppers of the best deal.\n\nAldi welcomed the results, issuing a statement stating it \"reaffirms Aldi's Price Promise\" which ensures the supermarket \"won't be beaten on the cost of your weekly shop\".\n\n\"The data reflected across this basket of goods is indicative of the savings across our entire range,\" Jordan Lack, Managing Director at Aldi Australia, said.\n\n\"We take our role as Australia's most affordable supermarket seriously and every day, every element of our business is oriented around how we can continue to deliver on our ambition to provide high quality groceries at the lowest possible price.\"\n\nChoice's next quarterly grocery price report will be released by the end of September.\n\nIt followed a recent Choice Consumer Pulse survey that found the cost of food and groceries was a huge concern for a huge 87 per cent of households.\n\nTrust levels in supermarkets has also plummeted in the last 12 months, the survey determined, with 39 per cent of respondents reporting they don't trust supermarkets to provide the best service and products to meet their needs.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType":

Meanwhile, the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is slightly in the red.\n\nThe report on grocery pricing from Choice found that Australians could be around 25% better off on groceries by shopping at Aldi compared to Coles and Woolworths.\n\nChoice's findings are based on the findings from undercover shoppers it sent to 81 supermarkets across Australia. These included Coles, Woolworths, Aldi, and some IGA stores. These shoppers recorded prices for a standardised basket of goods to determine which supermarket offered the best value.\n\nFindings showed the average basket, consisting of 14 items at Aldi costs $51.51, while the same basket costs $69.33 at Coles and $68.58 at Woolworths.\n\nThis indicates just a 75-cent difference between Coles and Woolworths but a significant saving at Aldi, it says.\n\nAshley de Silva, CEO of Choice, stated, \"Aldi is the best value when it comes to groceries across the nation\", according to The Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe report also highlights that Aldi's prices were more consistent across different locations, whereas prices at Coles and Woolworths showed more variation.\n\nChoice also pointed out regional price differences, noting that areas without Aldi stores, such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory, faced higher grocery prices. Additionally, even in states like Western Australia, where Aldi is present, people pay about $1 more for the same basket of goods.\n\nDe Silva added:\n\nOne of the things that we saw is that Aldi's prices across the stores that we visited were reasonably consistent, you get a bit more variation in Coles and Woolworths.\n\nThe supermarket giant acknowledged the report today, but said further analysis may be needed. \"We welcome Choice's contribution, however, it is unclear whether like-for-like products are being compared\", a company spokesperson said, per The ABC.\n\nBell Potter analysts are also constructive on Coles shares. According to my colleague James, the broker rated Coles a buy with a $19 per share price target.\n\nColes shares are in focus amid the ongoing competition in the Australian supermarket sector. The Choice report brings certain advantages and disadvantages into the spotlight.\n\nThis could challenge Coles to show investors its value proposition. Time will tell. In the last 12 months, Coles' share price has gone down over 7%, despite a 7% gain this year.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_bristow@fool.com.au", "name": "Zach Bristow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Woolworths Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coles Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Group_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woolworths Group (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coles Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P/ASX_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P/ASX 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGA_(supermarkets)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IGA (supermarkets)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Baskets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Baskets", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Basketry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Basketry", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Baskets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Baskets", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-163186090-1-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665720", "eventUri": "eng-9665720", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

basket of 14 commonly bought grocery items including milk, bread, sugar, pasta and tea bags and two fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe federal government gave Choice $1.1 million in the federal

Consumers in Tasmania or the Northern Territory paid more than those in other regions.\n\nSimilarly, shoppers in Western Australia paid over a dollar extra for their baskets compared to other regions.\n\n\"This is mainly due to the fact that these areas have fewer shopping options than the rest of the country, with no Aldi in Tassie or the NT,\" explained de Silva. Inside FMCG notes that those states are typically located further from manufacturing plants and mainstream supply chain routes as well.\n\nThe federal government granted Choice $1.1 million to conduct a quarterly analyses of supermarket pricing for the next three years.

Comparisons on brand name products to Aldi's range are difficult given it largely stocks its own-brand products. IGA was not included in most of the country -- Choice expects to increase its monitoring through the year.\n\nThe big two supermarkets have repeatedly pointed out the price of fresh produce is variable between States and even within regions given they aim to source locally.\n\nThe Federal Government gave Choice $1.1 million to conduct quarterly price surveys in a measure it said would help to increase competition in Australia's concentrated grocery market amid high inflation and a cost-of-living crunch that has persisted for nearly three years.\n\nIn WA, Choice reported Coles was the most expensive at $70.78, Woolworths coming in next at $69.29 and Aldi at $52.52, with an average of $64.19, or $62.69 when specials were used.\n\nWA was the most expensive State bar Tasmania and the NT, neither of which have Aldi and both of which face similar logistics price pressures to WA.\n\nNSW was second-most expensive for both Coles, at $69.80, and Woolworths, at $69.04, Choice reported.\n\nThe items compared were: apples; carrots; Weet-Bix; sliced white bread; flour; penne pasta; white sugar; tea bags; tinned diced tomatoes; a block of tasty cheese; full-cream dairy milk; frozen peas; beef mince and butter.\n\nColes took issue with Choice's findings -- compiled in March -- saying all its current prices were listed online, on its app and in-store, and customers looked at them each day.\n\n\"We welcome Choice's contribution; however, it is unclear whether like-for-like products are being compared,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Our analysis last week comparing the same basket in WA shows customers can purchase these products for $61.35 at Coles.\"\n\nShe added the supermarket giant was \"always working hard to deliver value\", particularly through its own brand range of essentials at lower prices.\n\nA Woolworths spokesman said all its pricing was transparent via weekly catalogues and on its website, and almost 110,000 customers each week used \"best unit price\" filters on its app and website.\n\n\"We know many of our customers pick Woolworths because of our wide range of high-quality products at competitive prices in more than 1000 locations across Australia,\" he said.\n\nAssistant Minister for Competition Andrew Leigh said it was \"only fair\" big supermarket chains received proper scrutiny to ensure they were \"doing the right thing by their customers\".\n\n\"Helping shoppers find the best deal makes the family budget stretch further and puts more competitive pressure on the supermarkets,\" Dr Leigh said.\n\nChoice chief executive Ashley de Silva said the organisation looked forward to enhancing the clear and reliable information it could provide consumers.\n\n\"This kind of transparency is more important than ever as the cost of living crisis continues, and prices of basic grocery items climb,\" he said.\n\nThe report from Choice comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny on the supermarkets amid accusations -- vehemently contested -- of price-gouging and profiteering.\n\nThe Federal Government has also directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to conduct a prices inquiry, with an interim report due in August, while State Parliaments in Queensland and SA have also held inquiries into supermarket pricing.\n\nA final report into the grocery code of conduct is also due within months.", "source":

The 14 everyday grocery items at Woolworths and Coles came to $68.58 and $69.33, respectively.\n\nThe two big hitters dominate Australia's grocery market with a collective 65 per cent share. And surprisingly, despite delivering consistently lower prices, Aldi has still only managed to corner 10 per cent.\n\nThat's about five million shoppers in its 590 stores a month.\n\nAldi Australia's managing director Jordan Lack has thrown a challenge for shoppers.\n\n\"Our everyday low pricing model means customers have certainty when they walk through our doors,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"We saved our customers $3.4 billion last year alone, so for Australians that haven't made the switch ... and are looking to reduce their grocery bill, we say give ALDI a go.\"\n\nHe said the German supermarket \"won't be beaten\", with CHOICE's findings reflective of savings they deliver across their whole range of products.\n\n\"We take our role as Australia's most affordable supermarket seriously and every day, every element of our business is oriented around how we can continue to deliver on our ambition to provide high-quality groceries at the lowest possible price.\"\n\nThe report comes at a time when Australians are facing significant pressure on their weekly budgets.\n\nCHOICE pointed out a problem Yahoo Finance deep-dived into after seeing the tit-for-tat approach to price drops, which experts said exposed a major issue for all Australian shoppers.\n\n\"Grocery prices at Coles and Woolworths are very closely matched, with only 75 cents separating the prices of our basket of 14 items without specials,\" CHOICE CEO Ashley de Silva said.\n\nIn essence, a lack of competition. Neither of the big players really pushes the envelope in pricing because they already dominate the market.\n\nWhat groceries were in the 'average Aussie's shopping basket'?\n\nCHOICE sent undercover shoppers to 27 Woolworths, 27 Coles and 23 Aldi stores across 27 locations with a good spread of socio-economic areas.\n\nIGA got just four visits as they only sent shoppers there if no Aldis were in the area.\n\nThe comparisons were done on a basket of 14 items, including national brands and comparable supermarket or budget-brands. They included specials.\n\nThe consumer advocacy group found those living in Tasmania and the Northern Territory were paying \"around a dollar more\" a week for their groceries. De Silva said this was due to \"limited options for shopping.\n\nAldi stocks fewer items, about 1800 products compared to the 25,000 products sold by its big competitors.\n\nThere's no loyalty program and the German supermarket doesn't try to compete in the online shopping sphere, instead claiming the focus is on all-year low prices and Special Buys.\n\nAldi has even claimed to have saved Australians who don't even shop with them more than $7.8 billion since arriving here in 2000 simply by pricing items so low major supermarkets have no choice but to drop theirs to compete.\n\nAldi's 10 per cent share in the grocery market is much smaller than Woolworths and Coles, with 37 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.\n\nThat's why Matt Grundoff from the Australia Institute described the grocery market here as \"broken\".\n\n\"When the spotlight is on them on this issue, they're prepared to do something,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But, let's be clear, a sale is a temporary thing. And the moment the spotlight is away, they're going to happily let prices revert to going back up again.\"\n\nColes and Woolworths have been marched out in front of inquiries and forced to defend their pricing, with an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigation underway.\n\nThis CHOICE report is actually a government measure to keep pressure on supermarkets over how much consumers have to pay at the checkout for weekly essentials and you will see one every quarter.\n\nThe Australian duopoly blamed inflation and external factors for price hikes, while claiming their profits are \"razor thin\". CHOICE did another analysis of their defences and here are the highlights.\n\nProfits aren't that big\n\nWoolworths made a pretty sensational claim that if they dropped prices any further, making zero profits, shoppers would only save $5 a week.\n\nThe supermarket claimed it makes just $3.60 for every $100 of revenue.\n\nColes said riding grocery prices were linked to what they had to fork out for \"commodities, shipping, oil and fertiliser\" as well as the effects of wars and natural disasters.\n\nWoolies told a similar tale, blaming food inflation on \"international supply and demand dynamics, higher production costs, and weather events\".\n\nThere is competition: Look at Aldi and online disrupters\n\nBoth Coles and Woolies said competition is similar to other developed nations.\n\nThey pointed to IGA, Foodland, Drakes, Harris Farm, Costco, and Amazon.", "source": {"uri": "au.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo7 Finance"}, "authors": [{"uri": "belinda_grant_geary@au.finance.yahoo.com", "name": "Belinda Grant-Geary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Woolworths Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coles Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

This kind of transparency is more important than ever as the cost of living crisis continues, and prices of basic grocery items climb,\" Ms de Silva said.\n\nThe findings follow calls for price gouging to be outlawed after a Senate committee released its final report last month.\n\nRecommendations from the review included supermarket duopoly Coles and Woolworths facing criminal penalties if found to be overcharging customers.\n\nThe committee found Coles and Woolworths had combined sales of about $80 billion in the 2023 financial year, accounting for two-thirds of the food and grocery sector.\n\nLate last month, Coles announced an array of price drops for the next three months as part of a price drop campaign to assist Australians with cost of living pressures.\n\nThe supermarket said it was cutting prices on 200 goods to increase the amount of products in its \"Down Down\" pricing discount category to 800.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gemma_crotty@skynews.com.au", "name": "Gemma Crotty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_de_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashley de Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanese_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albanese government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woolworths Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coles Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_gouging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price gouging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Baskets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Baskets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/eaa58d397b1b5f9d38f4bdaa2f65371d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665720", "eventUri": "eng-9665720", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

That's about five million shoppers in its 590 stores a month.\n\nWhile Woolworths and Coles have 37 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively.\n\nThat's why Matt Grundoff from the Australia Institute described the grocery market here as \"broken\".\n\n\"When the spotlight is on them on this issue, they're prepared to do something,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But, let's be clear, a sale is a temporary thing. And the moment the spotlight is away, they're going to happily let prices revert to going back up again.\"\n\nColes and Woolworths have been marched out in front of inquiries and forced to defend their pricing, with an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigation underway.\n\nThis CHOICE report is actually a government measure to keep pressure on supermarkets over how much consumers have to pay at the checkout for weekly essentials and you will see one every quarter.\n\nThe Australian duopoly blamed inflation and external factors for price hikes, while claiming their profits are \"razor thin\". CHOICE did another analysis of their defences and here are the highlights.\n\nProfits aren't that big\n\nWoolworths made a pretty sensational claim that if they dropped prices any further, making zero profits, shoppers would only save $5 a week.\n\nThe supermarket claimed it makes just $3.60 for every $100 of revenue.\n\nColes said riding grocery prices were linked to what they had to fork out for \"commodities, shipping, oil and fertiliser\" as well as the effects of wars and natural disasters.\n\nWoolies told a similar tale, blaming food inflation on \"international supply and demand dynamics, higher production costs, and weather events\".\n\nThere is competition: Look at Aldi and online disrupters\n\nBoth Coles and Woolies said competition is similar to other developed nations.\n\nThey pointed to IGA, Foodland, Drakes, Harris Farm, Costco, and Amazon.", "source": {"uri": "au.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo7 Finance"}, "authors": [{"uri": "belinda_grant_geary@au.finance.yahoo.com", "name": "Belinda Grant-Geary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Woolworths Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coles_Supermarkets", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coles Supermarkets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_de_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashley de Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

Farmers say they're not trying to compete", "body": "The near-identical prices charged at Coles and Woolworths raises competition concerns, according to the agricultural sector, as scrutiny over the major chains intensifies after the release of government-funded grocery comparisons.\n\nResearch conducted by consumer group Choice found there was less than a one dollar price difference in a basket of groceries, containing 14 common items including apples, bread, milk and cheese, bought at both supermarkets.\n\nThe price comparison, conducted by undercover shoppers as part of a government-funded initiative, showed that a basket of comparable items bought at Aldi cost about 25% less.\n\nJolyon Burnett, from the National Farmers' Federation, said on Thursday the findings raised questions over whether the big two supermarkets were really competing against each other.\n\n\"Price matching, if practised by supermarkets, would be an example of a factor other than pure supply and demand influencing the pricing of fresh products,\" said Burnett, the chair of the NFF's horticulture council.\n\nFruit and vegetable growers were among the fiercest critics of the major supermarkets at March's Senate inquiry, after they accused them of driving down prices paid to suppliers while hiking prices for shoppers.\n\nAldi's basket of groceries cost an average of $51.51, while Woolworths' equivalent was $68.58, according to Choice's findings. The Coles basket cost $69.33.\n\nComparable items were chosen based on a range of factors including size, quality and ingredients, according to the consumer group.\n\nA Coles spokesperson disputed the findings on Thursday.\n\n\"We welcome Choice's contribution, however, it is unclear whether like-for-like products are being compared,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Our analysis last week comparing the same basket in NSW shows customers can purchase these products for $59.35 at Coles.\"\n\nA Woolworths spokesperson said many customers choose the supermarket \"because of our wide range of high quality products at competitive prices\".\n\nChoice will publish comparison reports every quarter over the next three years to provide insight into price movements of popular items.\n\nSeparately, the federal government has directed the competition watchdog to investigate grocery pricing practices and competition via a 12-month inquiry, which is under way.\n\nGrocery prices are a significant contributor to household costs and inflation calculations.\n\nThe assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, said the Choice findings would help empower consumers.\n\n\"Australia's grocery sector is one of the most concentrated in the world with a significant market share for the two biggest players, so it's only fair we have considerable price scrutiny on the prices of groceries being paid by Australian shoppers,\" Leigh said.\n\n\"We have too many markets dominated by too few firms.\"\n\nColes and Woolworths collectively control about two-thirds of the supermarket sector in

The comparable Coles basket was $69.33.\n\nChoice's chief executive, Ashley de Silva, said the findings were designed to give consumers access to transparent, clear and reliable information around pricing.\n\n\"Levels of trust in the supermarkets aren't high,\" de Silva said. \"This kind of transparency is more important than ever as the cost of living crisis continues, and prices of basic grocery items climb.\"\n\nThe 14 items are all common groceries such as apples, sliced bread, flour, tinned tomatoes, cheese and milk. Specials were not included.\n\nComparable items were chosen based on a range of factors including size, quality and ingredients.\n\nPrices also differed according to location, with consumers in Tasmania and Northern Territory paying more for their groceries. They are also the only two states and territories where Aldi is not present, making them less competitive markets than the rest of the country.\n\n\"It definitely is a factor that there isn't another major supermarket there and that doesn't help people in those areas,\" de Silva said.\n\nOn average, people outside Australian capital cities pay slightly less for groceries than those in the major cities.\n\nChoice will publish comparison reports every quarter over the next three years to provide insight into price movements of popular items. The government has previously said the findings will provide shoppers with better information on the comparative costs of grocery goods at different retailers, highlighting those charging the most and the least.\n\nThe supermarket sector faced a Senate inquiry earlier this year, which recommended the government adopt measures to strengthen regulation, prevent price gouging, and increase penalties for anti-competitive behaviour.\n\nSeparately, the federal government has directed the competition watchdog to investigate grocery pricing practices and competition via a 12-month probe, which is under way.\n\nThe major supermarkets have repeatedly defended their business practices and blamed the rising cost of groceries on price increases imposed by major global food brands and general inflationary pressures.\n\nGuardian Australia analysis has consistently shown that the big two supermarkets bolstered profit margins to beyond pre-pandemic levels during a period of fast-rising grocery prices for shoppers.\n\nThere are early signs profit margins will be pressured by ongoing public and political scrutiny in a trend noted by the financial analyst community.\n\nBree Hurst, associate professor at Queensland University of Technology, said she expected the public and political scrutiny to lead to lower grocery prices for consumers.\n\n\"However, my concern would be that behind the scenes, they are pushing the cost of these discounts on to their suppliers so that their margin remains the same,\" Hurst said.\n\nFruit and vegetable growers recently told the Senate inquiry that some hadn't received price increases from the major supermarkets in 15 years, while farmers were pressured to fund price promotions.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

So what we decided to do as a federal government was to fund CHOICE to do these reports every quarter and to make them public for all Australians.\n\nSo that's the information that's out there today, helping shoppers get a better deal, and of course every time you move down the road to a cheaper supermarket, you're putting more competitive pressure on the system and you're ensuring that all prices have downward pressure placed on them.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nThe top 3, ACT, Victoria, Queensland, in that order, I mean they're covered by 20 cents per average shop, which some people might not think is much. Would I be right in broadly saying if there's a third player like Aldi you'll pay less in your jurisdiction?\n\nLEIGH:\n\nThat seems to be the clear result of the research. We know that when Aldi came into the system that we saw overall national grocery prices fall, but it's very clear that Aldi is coming out about 25 per cent cheaper across the jurisdictions where it operates, and that means for shoppers in the Northern Territory and Tasmania which don't have Aldi, they do end up paying a higher price for their groceries.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nWhat sort of pressure do you think research funded by your government puts on the big players really, or in fact do they look at it, nod their head and just keep doing what they do?\n\nLEIGH:\n\nOh, no, I think their focus is very much, Adam, on shoppers' habits. If shoppers are going to a competing supermarket they'll respond in kind.\n\nWe know that they're paying close attention to what items are in the CHOICE basket. We don't want them gaming the system, we want them putting downward pressure on the prices right across their stores.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nBut if you're a Coles or a Woolies, you know, you diversify your business, as they have in so many different sectors, is this really going to touch the sides for them? How much pressure do you believe they really feel when they see a report like this?\n\nLEIGH:\n\nHuge amounts of pressure. Now they don't have a captive market, people move around their shop all the time, and there's been a rise in what they call 'split basket shopping', where people are doing part of their shop at one supermarket and part at another supermarket.\n\nSo, this competitive pressure is good, particularly in an environment in which we've got one of the most concentrated grocery sectors in the world. The market share of the 2 big players here is larger than it is in many other advanced countries and so in that environment it's only fair that we have a lot of scrutiny being placed on the prices on the supermarket shelf.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nAs welcome as the competition might be and that Canberrans might think this report is, is this the only or the primary way that you and the government is looking at trying to lower the cost of prices in supermarkets, where I guess we can say historical research has said we pay a fair bit because of the duopoly here?\n\nLEIGH:\n\nThis is just one of the things we're doing in supermarket space. So we've got the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doing a deep dive into supermarkets. They'll be reporting in August.\n\nWe've asked Craig Emerson, the former Competition Minister, to review the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct and whether it should be made mandatory. That report will be out in final form by the end of the month.\n\nSo we're very concerned about the behaviour of the supermarkets. We want to make sure that farmers and shoppers get a better deal. That's a big focus of my role as the Assistant Minister for Competition.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nAndrew Leigh is our guest, Assistant Minister for Competition, Federal Member for Fenner.\n\nWhere do you shop? Do you try and do a split basket shop, as Dr Leigh just defined it as, when you might go to Aldi, a grocery store, the butcher, not just the big 2, Coles and Woolies? 1300 681 666.\n\nIt might surprise you to know what we're talking about is that a CHOICE secret shopper list of 14 common grocery items show that the ACT, out of all the states and territories, was cheaper for the average cost of that shop than any other part of Australia.\n\nTo what degree might you look at intervention in this area, depending on what your report in August comes back with, Dr Leigh, depending on what Craig Emerson tells you, that you might consider at least government intervention? Because there has been this description, this consideration, in other big industry players.\n\nLEIGH:\n\nWe're certainly open to whatever the ACCC comes back with, Adam. So far there hasn't been very good international evidence for one of the things that the National Party's been calling for, divestment powers. We're also aware that these are not only significant businesses for shoppers but also for workers. Woolworths is Australia's biggest private sector employer.\n\nSo when Peter Dutton at the start of the year was calling on people to boycott Woolworths, when he's calling for the break\u2011up of Woolworths, it's just not quite clear that's good for people who work at Woolworths, or indeed for people who shop at Woolworths.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nThere has been an argument though for things like the airline industry, I'm thinking Qantas and Jetstar Group, that there could be a case, locally Stephen Byron, for instance, has said we should definitely look at federal government intervention for breaking up such a powerful force, as he sees it. Can you make the same argument for supermarkets?\n\nLEIGH:\n\nWe've got a strong competition watchdog and one of the things we've done through setting up the competition taskforce is now to put forward a plan for reforming Australia's merger laws.\n\nOne of our big focuses, Adam, in getting more competition in the Australian economy, which is sorely needed, is making sure we don't see mergers taking place which are anti-competitive. We need better scrutiny of those mergers - a simpler, fairer, more efficient merger system.\n\nThat's where our energy has been focussed rather than on divestment, which is a power that's very rarely used where it exists in other countries.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nThis texter makes an interesting point. Why don't we require the supermarkets to publish their unit prices in a spreadsheet every week so we can compare instead of doing a survey like this? How valuable might that be as an initiative?\n\nLEIGH:\n\nYeah, I mean there's certainly a lot of information available. If you go on to their websites you can find those data, and the unit prices on shelves -\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nBut it's not central, you have to go from one site to the next I think. What this texter is suggesting is a central spreadsheet that you as a government force these big players to publish.\n\nLEIGH:\n\nYeah, that's right. I mean the items are different and so getting an apples to apples comparison isn't straightforward. There are certainly aggregators that work to try and compare prices across supermarkets. My understanding is that they don't tend to be terribly widely used, which is why we've focussed on this headline grocery shopping exercise which provides you with a single point of comparison across the supermarkets.\n\nNow the question always, Adam, with information to consumers is how do you provide it in the right level of detail that people will really use it? These CHOICE reports have been popular in the past. That's why we're getting them done regularly and publicly.\n\nSHIRLEY:\n\nOkay. Andrew Leigh, we'll see what the next one shows for point of comparison.

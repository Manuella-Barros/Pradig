{"id": 232020766, "title": "The reason why this part of Manchester is the only place in Britain with no Lib Dem candidate", "text": "Thousands of candidates are standing to be an MP at the general election on July 4 with some political parties standing in almost every seat in Britain. The Conservatives, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens have the highest number with Reform UK close behind. Of these five parties, only the Greens are standing in Chorley where the House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is running for re-election. Labour have someone standing in every other constituency outside of Northern Ireland with 631 candidates in total. The Conservatives are fielding five candidates in Northern Ireland. However, the party does not have anyone standing in Rotherham.

This new constituency includes Fallowfield, Whalley Range, Ardwick, Hulme and Moss Side which were previously part of Manchester Central and Gorton. Seb Bate was reported to have been selected to stand in Rusholme for the Lib Dems. But his name will not appear on the ballot. The party says it is committed to standing in every seat in the country. But it has blamed the omission on an 'administrative error'. A Lib Dem spokesperson said: \"The Liberal Democrats are committed to standing in every seat in the country. In Manchester Rusholme there was an administrative error which has led to us not contesting it. \"But in many areas, it's clear only we can beat the Conservatives and deliver the change people want.\" Labour, the Conservatives and the Greens all have candidates in Manchester Rusholme. George Galloway's Workers Party of Britain and the Communist League party are also fielding candidates in the constituency where an independent candidate is also standing.", "summary": "The Lib Dems have 630 general election candidates", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/reason-part-manchester-only-place-29321793", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29300632.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Curry-mile.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:55:33", "author": "Joseph Timan", "authors": ["Joseph Timan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.387}

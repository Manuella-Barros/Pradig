These commitments have been submitted by TikTok to address the concerns raised by the Commission in the formal proceedings opened against TikTok on 22 April and ensure compliance with the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nThe platform has made the following commitments:\n\nA commitment to withdraw the TikTok Lite Rewards programme from the EU, permanently;\n\nA commitment not to launch any other programme which would circumvent the withdrawal.\n\nToday's decision makes these commitments legally binding, meaning that any breach of the commitments would immediately amount to a breach of the DSA and could therefore lead to fines. With this decision, the Commission is also closing the formal proceedings opened against TikTok on 22 April.\n\nThis is the first case the Commission closes under the DSA, 105 days after the opening of the proceedings. This is also the first time that the Commission accepts commitments from a designated online platform against which it had opened formal proceedings under the DSA.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe Commission will carefully monitor TikTok's compliance with the binding commitments the platform has offered under article 71 of the DSA, as well as with its other obligations under the DSA.\n\nThe Commission's first formal proceedings against TikTok, which were launched on 19 February, remain open and the investigation continues.\n\nBackground\n\nTikTok Lite is a new separate version of the TikTok app. Following its launch in Spain and France in April 2024, the Commission expressed concerns regarding the TikTok Lite Rewards programme, which allowed users to earn points while performing certain 'Tasks' on TikTok Lite, such as watching videos, liking content, following creators, inviting friends to join TikTok, etc.\n\nThe Commission was concerned that the TikTok Lite Rewards programme had been launched without a prior diligent assessment of the risks it entails, particularly in relation to the addictive effect of the Rewards programme, and without taking effective risk mitigating measures. The Rewards programme, which may stimulate addictive behaviour, could potentially have negative effects on the physical and mental health of users. This is of particular concern for minors, who may have a heightened sensitivity to such features.\n\nUnder the DSA, Very Large Online Platforms are required to perform a risk assessment and submit a report to the Commission's services prior to launching any new functionalities that are likely to have a critical impact on systemic risks. They also have to adopt effective mitigating measures to address identified risks.\n\nAs TikTok failed to provide a risk assessment report in relation to the launch of TikTok Lite, the Commission adopted a decision on 22 April to initiate formal proceedings against TikTok and warned TikTok of its intention to suspend the TikTok Lite Rewards programme in the EU. On 24 April, the Commission took note of TikTok's decision to voluntary suspend the TikTok Lite Rewards programme in the European Union.\n\nCurrently there are formal proceedings open under the DSA against X (from December 2023, for which preliminary findings were issued on 12 July 2024), TikTok (February 2024), AliExpress (March 2024), and Meta (April and May 2024).\n\n/Public Release.

It opened its probe into the new TikTok Lite reward feature in April.\n\nThe EU enforcers said at the time the program could be harmful to the mental health of users and in breach of the DSA. The Commission also believed TikTok may not be able to correctly identify underage users, meaning teenagers could have also used the feature and spend more time on the viral video app. TikTok failed to provide the Commission with information on the risks of the new feature, officials added.\n\nTikTok later said it would temporarily stop the feature in the EU.\n\nThe company, owned by Chinese tech firm ByteDance, still faces a probe opened in February over insufficiently protecting teenagers on its apps, including through an allegedly addictive algorithm and inadequate mechanisms to check

Reuters reports that the company has now agreed to permanently withdraw this scheme.\n\nThe EU in April demanded an immediate risk assessment from TikTok on the app, shortly after it was launched in France and Spain, because of concerns about its potential impact on children and users' mental health [...]\n\nThe EU's executive branch said TikTok had now made legally binding commitments to withdraw the rewards programme from the EU and to not launch any other programme that would circumvent that decision.\n\nHowever, the app is still under investigation for other potential breaches of the law. These enquiries relate to child protection on content, transparency in advertising, and competition law.\n\nBack in March, the House voted overwhelmingly to either ban TikTok from the US, or to force the sale of the app to an American-owned company.\n\nTikTok took the US government to court, arguing that the threatened ban would be unconstitutional, interfering with a first amendment right to free speech. That case has been fast-tracked, and will be heard in September.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_lovejoy@9to5mac.com", "name": "Ben Lovejoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/08/TikTok-ban-in-Europe-less-likely.webp?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791290", "eventUri": "eng-9791290", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Abdullah had lost the elections to Engineer Rashid from Baramulla. \"Rashid's victory, without doubt, will empower secessionists and give Kashmir's defeated Islamist movement a renewed sense of hope,\" Omar Abdullah said in a post on X citing the said article.\n\n\"Efforts to draw secessionism back into electoral politics led New Delhi to support the rise of the People's Democratic Party and its alliance with the BJP. That, however, ended up empowering violent secessionists, not mainstreaming them--a warning of the unpredictable outcomes of trying to manipulate politics,\" he added in his post on X citing the article. Omar Abdullah's post on X drew sharp criticism from PDP's Waheed Para who accused Abdullah of not acknowledging the people's mandate.\n\n\"Extremely disappointed with Omar Abdullah's regressive stance, echoing the divisive politics of 1987, and dubbing a democratic expression as an 'Islamist wave'. His family's history with the Muslim Conference clashes with calls for the exclusion of PDP, Er Rashid, and JEI, and will put Kashmir into perpetual conflict with the state. A more prudent approach, akin to Mehbooba Mufti's plea for Engineer Rashid's release, would have been an acknowledgement of the mandate,\" Para said in a post on X. Replying to the post Abdullah said that he had only cited a point of view and had spoken about Engineer Rashid's release in his campaign.\n\n\"Waheed, I don't normally get into any back-and-forth conversations here but this time I'll make an exception. I spent my entire campaign talking about Engineer's release & unlike his campaign, I talked about the release of the 1000s detained since 2019. The articles I've put here are not my views but they are a point of view. I may agree with parts, disagree with parts but they are an opinion. As for Rashid's release, it's a matter for the courts as it is in all such cases. I didn't agree with Rashid's detention in the first place & I don't agree with it now but that's neither here nor there because it shouldn't be just about one man but about the 1000s in jail, including the anonymous ones outside J&K,\" Omar replied on X. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Rashid Sheikh, popularly known as Engineer Rashid, ran as an independent candidate for the Baramulla seat and defeated Omar Abdullah. He secured victory with a margin of 204142 votes and received 47,2481 votes.\n\nEarlier, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP Chief, Mehbooba Mufti, congratulated Engineer Rashid on Wednesday and urged the government to respect the people's verdict, calling for his release. \"Heartfelt congratulations to Mian Altaf, Aga Ruhullah, Engineer Rashid & Haneefa Jan for winning the parliament elections. Government of India must respect the verdict of the people & release Engineer Rashid,\" Mufti said in a post on X.\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha election, besides Rashid winning the Baramulla seat, the National Conference and the BJP won two seats each in Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP did not field any candidate in Kashmir.

He secured victory with a margin of 204142 votes and received 47,2481 votes.\n\nEarlier, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP Chief, Mehbooba Mufti, congratulated Engineer Rashid on Wednesday and urged the government to respect the people's verdict, calling for his release.\n\n\"Heartfelt congratulations to Mian Altaf, Aga Ruhullah, Engineer Rashid & Haneefa Jan for winning the parliament elections. Government of India must respect the verdict of the people & release Engineer Rashid,\" Mufti said in a post on X.\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha election, besides Rashid winning the Baramulla seat, the National Conference and the BJP won two seats each in Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP did not field any candidate in Kashmir.

A controversy erupted after National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah on Thursday posted a news article on a social media platform that suggested Engineer Rashid's win in the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat will empower \"secessionists\". The row broke out after a private television news agency attributed the excerpts of the article shared by the NC leader to him. It triggered reactions from mainstream politicians in Jammu and Kashmir, including PDP's Waheed Para.\n\nAbdullah was defeated by Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as 'Engineer Rashid', who is jailed under the UAPA, by more than two lakh votes in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe National Conference (NC) leader had conceded defeat and congratulated Rashid on his win.\n\n\"The 'big loser' tag certainly hurts but it's an election, you win some you lose some and life goes on,\" Abdullah posted on X on Thursday, a day after attending an INDIA bloc meeting in Delhi.\n\nThis reaction was after some news articles referred to him and others as the \"big losers\" of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nRecalling the his school's song, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said on X, \"...I sang (this) as part of my school song for years, still holds true today.\"\n\n\"Never give in is our motto; strive till the set of sun; And we learn it's truth; In the days of youth on the long Hodson run; For though your heart seems bursting; Up Sergeant Tilly's hill; THOUGH YOU MAY NOT WIN; YOU'LL YET COME IN; if you stick it still,\" he posted.\n\nAccording to the Lawrence School Sanawar's website, the song was written by Henry Bickersteth Durrant, Bishop of Lahore, and set to the music by Bandmaster A Swann between the 1923 and 1925. Its official title was 'The Best School of All'.\n\nTaking a dig at Abdullah for sharing the news article, PDP youth president Para posted on X, \"Extremely disappointed with @OmarAbdullah's regressive stance, echoing the divisive politics of 1987, and dubbing a democratic expression as an 'Islamist wave'.\"\n\n\"His family's history with the Muslim Conference clashes with calls for the exclusion of PDP, Er Rashid, and JEI, and will put Kashmir into perpetual conflict with the State. A more prudent approach, akin to @MehboobaMufti's plea for Er Rashid's release, would have been acknowledgment of mandate,\" Para posted on X.\n\nIn a quick reply, Abdullah said he had himself been an advocate for the release of not only Engineer Rashid but the thousands of others who were languishing in jails.\n\n\"Waheed I don't normally get into any back and forth conversations here but this time I'll make an exception. I spent my entire campaign talking about Engineer's release and unlike his campaign I talked about the release of the 1000s detained since 2019,\" he said.\n\n\"The articles I've put here are not my views but they are a point of view.

It triggered reactions from mainstream politicians in Jammu and Kashmir, including PDP's Waheed Para.\n\nAbdullah was defeated by Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as 'Engineer Rashid', who is jailed under the UAPA, by more than two lakh votes in the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe National Conference (NC) leader had conceded defeat and congratulated Rashid on his win.\n\n\"The 'big loser' tag certainly hurts but it's an election, you win some you lose some and life goes on,\" Abdullah posted on X on Thursday, a day after attending an INDIA bloc meeting in Delhi.\n\nThis reaction was after some news articles referred to him and others as the \"big losers\" of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nRecalling the his school's song, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said on X, \"...I sang (this) as part of my school song for years, still holds true today.\" \"Never give in is our motto; strive till the set of sun; And we learn it's truth; In the days of youth on the long Hodson run; For though your heart seems bursting; Up Sergeant Tilly's hill; THOUGH YOU MAY NOT WIN; YOU'LL YET COME IN; if you stick it still,\" he posted.\n\nAccording to the Lawrence School Sanawar's website, the song was written by Henry Bickersteth Durrant, Bishop of Lahore, and set to the music by Bandmaster A Swann between the 1923 and 1925. Its official title was 'The Best School of All'.\n\nTaking a dig at Abdullah for sharing the news article, PDP youth president Para posted on X, \"Extremely disappointed with @OmarAbdullah's regressive stance, echoing the divisive politics of 1987, and dubbing a democratic expression as an 'Islamist wave'.\" \"His family's history with the Muslim Conference clashes with calls for the exclusion of PDP, Er Rashid, and JEI, and will put Kashmir into perpetual conflict with the State. A more prudent approach, akin to @MehboobaMufti's plea for Er Rashid's release, would have been acknowledgment of mandate,\" Para posted on X.\n\nIn a quick reply, Abdullah said he had himself been an advocate for the release of not only Engineer Rashid but the thousands of others who were languishing in jails.\n\n\"Waheed I don't normally get into any back and forth conversations here but this time I'll make an exception. I spent my entire campaign talking about Engineer's release and unlike his campaign I talked about the release of the 1000s detained since 2019,\" he said.\n\n\"The articles I've put here are not my views but they are a point of view. I may agree with parts, disagree with parts but they are an opinion. As for Rashid's release, it's a matter for the courts as it is in all such cases,\" Abdullah said. \"I didn't agree with Rashid's detention in the first place and I don't agree with it now but that's neither here nor there because it shouldn't be just about one man but about the 1000s in jail, including the anonymous ones outside Jammu and Kashmir,\" he said.\n\nPeople's Conference president Sajad Gani Lone, who barely managed to save his security deposit in the Lok Sabha polls in the Baramulla seat, has gone on a sabbatical for a \"few days\".\n\n\"I will be away for a few days. Taking a break to step back, pause and reflect. Winning and losing is part of life.

Two former chief ministers lost, and independent candidates made their mark. Jammu and Kashmir made history with over 58 percent voter turnout, breaking all previous records of the last forty years. This was a significant shock and a setback for two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who lost the elections by huge margins.\n\nMehbooba Mufti lost to National Conference leader Mian Altaf by over 2.8 lakh votes. However, the bigger shock was Omar Abdullah losing to jailed independent candidate Engineer Rashid, who took the lead with over two lakh votes, leaving Abdullah far behind.\n\nSheikh Abdul Rashid, also known as Engineer Rashid, is a former MLA from the Langate assembly seat in North Kashmir's Kupwara district. Rashid won the assembly seat twice in a row and heads the Awami Ittehad Party. He has been in jail since 2019, booked by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in a terror funding case, and has been lodged in Tihar Jail in Delhi. He is the first mainstream politician to be arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Engineer Rashid's son, Abrar Rashid, credited the people of Baramulla for their support during the election campaign.\n\nAbrar Rashid said, \"It's the victory of people who joined us in the election campaign. Today, when Omar Abdullah accepted his defeat, the credit goes to those youths who spent their own money and remained by our side.\"\n\nDuring his time as an elected MLA, Engineer Rashid was also considered a separatist sympathizer. Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah took to social media and shared a quote from a story: \"Rashid's victory, without doubt, will empower secessionists, and give Kashmir's defeated Islamist movement a renewed sense of hope. Efforts to draw secessionism back into electoral politics led New Delhi to support the rise of the People's Democratic Party, and its alliance with the BJP. That, however, ended up empowering violent secessionists, not mainstreaming them -- a warning of the unpredictable outcomes of trying to manipulate politics.\"\n\nAlthough these were not Omar Abdullah's words, sharing them on social media was seen as an endorsement of the same thoughts.\n\nAnother surprise was independent candidate Haji Haneefa Jan, who won the Ladakh Parliamentary seat. Haji was previously associated with the National Conference and served as the district president of the party in Ladakh. He decided to run independently in this parliamentary election as the INDIA alliance fielded Namgyal as their candidate. The Kargil Unit of the National Conference resigned en masse after Namgyal was chosen as their candidate.\n\nIn 2023, Haneefa had lost the Kargil elections for the Barro constituency in the LAHDC Kargil by a mere 66 votes. After Omar Abdullah decided to field a different candidate for the Ladakh seat, Haji decided to quit and run solo. Environmentalist and educationist Sonam Wangchuk's demand for statehood for Ladakh and his 21-day hunger strike, advocating for the UT to be brought under the Sixth Schedule of Article 244 of the Indian Constitution, also played a significant role in Haji's win.\n\nHaji Haneefa said, \"The people of Ladakh have given me a big mandate, and for the next five years, I will work on Ladakh's issues, both in parliament and outside.\"\n\nJammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh have six seats in total, out of which two have been won by independents. Two seats in the Kashmir region were won by NC leaders who were relatively unknown in the political scenario of Jammu and Kashmir but are highly respected individuals. The two seats in the Jammu region were retained by the BJP.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Many in the constituency believe that his jail term had something to do with his honest calling out of those in power, garnering sympathy votes for him.\n\nAbdul Rashid Sheikh also known as Engineer Rashid proved a giant slayer by defeating two top most leaders -- former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah and Peoples Conference chairperson Sajjad Gani Lone by a margin of more than two lakh votes.\n\nRashid's campaign, spearheaded by his son Abrar, found traction with the youth.\n\n'Victory of democracy'\n\n\"We didn't have the money to file Rashid's nomination, so the money was pooled by his supporters and many were not even sure whether his nomination form would be accepted. Once it was accepted, the people ran his campaign. From day one I was sure he was going to win by a big margin,\"former legislator Shoiab Lone, who was the first politician to support Rashid, said. \"His win is the victory of our democracy.\"\n\nRashid quickly emerged as the \"dark horse\" from the 22-candidate field contesting for the seat as his campaign, centred on unjust imprisonment and local issues, found widespread resonance.\n\nThe leader has taken the fight to Omar and Lone, both of whom had put their prestige at stake in the battle for Baramulla.\n\nAbrar, who is pursuing Masters in Botany, spearheaded the campaign for his jailed father Engineer Abdul Rashid. His fiery speeches caught the youth's attention and he was a household name across Kashmir, known for the art of short speeches and election sloganeering as he stood atop vehicles.\n\n\"Your vote can get my father released. I haven't seen him for the last five years. My father was detained just for highlighting issues of common Kashmir,\" he roared in one of his speeches amid applause from a massive crowd.\n\nBesides youths, members of non-governmental organisations and sports persons also declared their support for him, especially young and old women who voted for his release. The leader's five-year jail term has also become a talking point, finding traction with the youth.\n\nAs his lead in votes consolidated, hundreds of locals, especially youth, converged at his residence in Langate to celebrate his victory. \"To respect the huge mandate of the people, Engineer Rashid should be released,\" Ubaid Ahmad, a driver who spent money from his pocket to run Rashid's campaign, said.\n\nAfter his win, Rashid's aged mother appealed to the government to release him from jail. \"I haven't seen my son for the last five years. Now he should be released,\" she said as the young supporters raised slogans in favour of the jailed leader.\n\nSpread over four districts of Baramulla, Bandipora, Kupwara and parts of Budgam comprising 18 assembly segments, the constituency has around 17.62 lakh voters.\n\nNC candidates have been elected from the seat 10 times, including the last time in 2019 when Mohammad Akbar Lone defeated the PC candidate by a margin of 30,000 votes. The Baramulla witnessed recorded polling of nearly 60% which many termed as sympathy vote for jailed leader.\n\nThe victory of Rashid from north Kashmir is going to create a new upheaval among the politicians in Kashmir especially the established parties and those which were formed post abrogation of Article 370.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baramulla", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Abdullah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Omar Abdullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer_Rashid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineer Rashid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajjad_Gani_Lone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajjad Gani Lone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Akbar_Lone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Akbar Lone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Activities_(Prevention)_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langate_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Langate Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandipore_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bandipore district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgam_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budgam district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budgam district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupwara_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kupwara district"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Youth", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/04/1600x900/Jailed-Lok-Sabha-candidate-from-Baramulla-constitu_1717542471002.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629330", "eventUri": "eng-9629330", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

In defense of his actions, Abdullah elucidated his longstanding advocacy for the release of Rashid and thousands of others in detention.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Abdullah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omar Abdullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer_Rashid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineer Rashid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baramulla", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Activities_(Prevention)_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Civil_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Civil Engineering", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Publications", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/18_05_2024_11_03_38_7140114.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629330", "eventUri": "eng-9629330", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Rashid in the just concluded Lok Sabha elections in Baramulla by a margin of over 2.04 lakh votes had in a post on microblogging site 'X' quoted from Praveen Swami's article published in The Print which said, \"Rashid's victory, without doubt, will empower secessionists, and give Kashmir's defeated Islamist movement a renewed sense of hope. Efforts to draw secessionism back into electoral politics led New Delhi to support the rise of the People's Democratic Party, and its alliance with the BJP. That, however, ended up empowering violent secessionists, not mainstreaming them -- a warning of the unpredictable outcomes of trying to manipulate politics.\"\n\nBut as some news agencies attributed these lines quoted from the digital platform to Mr. Abdullah, People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader Waheed Ur Rehman Parra too came on 'X' to say that he was extremely disappointed with the former chief minister's \"regressive stance\". He said, \"Extremely disappointed with @OmarAbdullah's 's regressive stance, echoing the divisive politics of 1987, and dubbing a democratic expression as an 'Islamist wave'. His family's history with the Muslim Conference clashes with calls for the exclusion of PDP, Er Rashid, and JEI (Jamaat-e-Islami), and will put Kashmir into perpetual conflict with the state. A more prudent approach, akin to @MehboobaMufti's plea for Er Rashid's release, would have been acknowledgment of mandate\".\n\nMr. Abdullah was quick to reply to the criticism. He said, \"Waheed, I don't normally get into any back & forth conversations here but this time I'll make an exception. I spent my entire campaign talking about Engineer's release & unlike his campaign I talked about the release of the 1000s detained since 2019\".\n\nHe clarified that what his 'X' post had said were not his own views, but he had only quoted from a published article. \"The articles I've put here are not my views, but they are a point of view. I may agree with parts, disagree with parts but they are an opinion\".\n\nThe National Conference (NC) vice president further stated, \"As for Rashid's release, it's a matter for the courts as it is in all such cases. I didn't agree with Rashid's detention in the first place & I don't agree with it now but that's neither here nor there because it shouldn't be just about one man but about the 1000s in jail, including the anonymous ones outside J&K.\"\n\nNC's chief spokesperson and communication in-charge Tanvir Sadiq took an exception to his party leader being dragged into an unnecessary controversy. Quoting a post of ANI Digital which too attributed \"Engineer Rashid's victory will empower secessionists in J-K\" quote to Mr. Abdullah, he wrote on 'X', \"This is highly irresponsible. He never made that statement; he simply quoted an opinion piece written by Parveen Swamy. This is an extreme case of irresponsible journalism.

The media reports claimed that the former J&K chief minister said that Rashid Sheikh winning the Lok Sabha elections from the region, is a sign that \"Kashmiri secessionism is far from spent.\"\n\nAbdullah lost by a margin of nearly 2 lakh votes to independent candidate Sheikh Abdul Rashid, popularly known as Engineer Rashid. Founder of the Jammu and Kashmir Awami Ittehad Party, Rashid is currently jailed in an alleged terror funding case. The two time former MLA won despite having contested the elections from behind bars and facing UAPA charges.\n\nOn June 6, 2024 ANI published a story titled, '\"Engineer Rashid's victory will empower secessionists in J-K\": Omar Abdullah\"' misattributing a statement by journalist and author Praveen Swami in an opinion piece about the Kashmir elections, published in The Print.\n\nView an archive here\n\nANI has since deleted their tweet and updated the story removing the attribution of the quote to Abdullah.\n\nBOOM found that Omar Abdullah did not make such comments about Rashid and that the statement is from an opinion piece written by author and journalist Praveen Swami for The Print.\n\nWe found a tweet by Swami calling out ANI for their misreporting\n\nWe then looked for the opinion piece as published in The Print and found the statement misattibuted to Abdullah is the headline of the article.\n\nThe article analysis J&K's politics and how the hard-right parties from the Valley are attempting to reenter active politics.

Abdullah's tweet also does not claim that he made such a comment about Rashid.\n\nAbdullah tweeted an excerpt from the opinion piece using quotation marks. However, it appears news outlets mistook his tweet as his remark on Engineer Rashid.\n\nWe then ran a search for any comment made by Abdullah on his loss to Rashid and found his tweet from June 4, 2024 congratulating his opponent, \"I think it's time to accept the inevitable.

I don't believe his victory will hasten his release from prison nor will the people of North Kashmir get the representation they have a right to but the voters have spoken and in a democracy that's all that matters.\"", "source": {"uri": "boomlive.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "BOOMLive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nivedita_niranjankumar@boomlive.in", "name": "Nivedita Niranjankumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThePrint", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ThePrint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praveen_Swami", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Praveen Swami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Abdullah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omar Abdullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_&_Kashmir_National_Conference", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jammu & Kashmir National Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer_Rashid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineer Rashid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baramulla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Activities_(Prevention)_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_Peoples_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Publishing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Publishing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.boomlive.in/h-upload/2024/06/06/1028005-omar-abdullah-engineer-rashid-ani-false-claim.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629330", "eventUri": "eng-9629330", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He was arrested shortly after the Centre scrapped the Article 370 along with many other political leaders. Most of them were released later while Rashid continues to be in jail.\n\nAbrar said his father will not join NDA or INDIA bloc and will stay independent. However, he added that until his father was released from jail, he couldn't make any definite statements.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Siasat.com, Abrar Rashid said, he has not received any communication from anyone. \"If anything had happened, it may have been between Er Rashid and the party, but as far as I know, no such communication has been received,\" he said.\n\nReacting to the allegations about Er Rashid receiving support from the Centre, his son said that the his father fought the election as an independent candidate, and it was clearly visible on the ground.\n\nHe stated that his father was not fighting as anyones 'A, B or C team' but as an independent candidate with the support of the people of Kashmir.\n\nAbrar said that the true victory will be achieved when his father will be released from jail. \"The true victory will be when my father is released from jail and when he can work for freeing all political prisoners,\" he said.\n\nAbrar said that the electorate in Kashmir expressed their frustration with dynastic politics by voting for change and development. The election outcome demonstrated their aspiration for a better future and a break from the status quo.\n\nHe urged the Indian government to support the youth in Kashmir, highlighting their peaceful nature and democratic values. Abrar stressed the importance of engaging the younger generation in building a peaceful and prosperous Kashmir.\n\nIn response to critics who dismissed support on social media, Abrar pointed out that the election results validated the people's desire for transformation and representation. He called for a collaborative effort to address the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and pave the way for a brighter future.\n\nMeanwhile, Er Rashid's father said, \"It's not my son's victory, it's the people who supported him and made him the winner.\"\n\nKhazir Mohammad Sheikh said that his son, Engineer Rashid, has dedicated himself to serving the people and was sent by them to be their voice.\n\nHe said that while he was not inclined towards politics himself, it was the people who chose and empowered Er Rashid to advocate for the voiceless in Kashmir.\n\nHe said he is looking forward to his son being released from jail soon so he could extend his help to the numerous young people from Kashmir imprisoned across the country.\n\nHe hopes that his son's freedom would enable him to assist those in need and continue serving the people of Kashmir selflessly.\n\nHe appealed to the Government of India to expedite the release of his son so that he could return and serve the multitude of people eagerly anticipating his assistance.\n\nRashid was contesting against National Conference leader and former J&K CM Omar Abdullah and People's Conference leader Sajad Lone. Rashid won with a majority of over 2 lakh votes. He got 472481 votes while Abdullah finished second with 268339. Lone was came a distant third with 173239 votes.\n\nThe was the first general election in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019.\n\nIn jail since 2019, if Engineer Rashid is to be convicted and jailed for a minimum of two years, he would lose his seat in the Lok Sabha immediately as per the Supreme Court judgment of 2013, which holds that MPs and MLAs would be disqualified in such cases.\n\nThis decision struck down section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, which earlier allowed convicted MPs and MLAs three months to appeal against their convictions.", "source": {"uri": "siasat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Siasat Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suhail_bashir_khan@siasat.com", "name": "Suhail Bashir Khan",

While Omar Abdullah, the National Conference (NC) Vice President, lost from the Baramullah constituency, People's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti lost from Anantnag in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nIn what is being termed as a big upset in North Kashmir, independent candidate Abdul Rashid, popularly known as 'Engineer Rashid', turned into a 'giant killer' by trouncing Omar Abdullah by a whopping 2 lakh votes.\n\nWhat makes the debacle worse for Abdullah is that Rashid fought the election from Delhi's high security Tihar jail, where he is incarcerated under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Rashid was arrested after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nPolitical observers say Engineer Rashid's victory in many ways is the victory of Indian democracy. He filed his nomination papers while in jail, and his family was uncertain about whether he would be allowed to contest. But since he is only an accused and not proven guilty yet, the Election Commission accepted his nomination. From there started his fairytale electoral journey.\n\nWith no money, no organisational structure, and no election strategy, Rashid's son Abrar Ahmed started his road shows with the help of some friends. Within days, this unique campaign started attracting large crowds, the sympathy factor seemed to help him connect with the masses. From kids to youth, and even the elderly joined his road shows.\n\n\"I started with 20 supporters, the intent was to meet people and make them understand our cause. When I saw people joining us in big numbers, especially the youth who even came barefoot to be with us, I realised we could win. This dream campaign that was visualised without any money, big party or election strategy, can come true. Today is the day of people's victory,\" says an overjoyed Abrar Ahmed, who ran a historic campaign for his father in a matter of two weeks, taking North Kashmir by storm.\n\nAccording to political observers, this is a rare case of an organic campaign for a jailed leader, where the masses lent their support in the hope that a victory for Rashid would get him out of jail. The sympathy wave for Engineer Rashid drowned the campaigns of heavyweights like Omar Abdullah and Sajjad Gani Lone of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference.\n\nAbrar Ahmed's campaign for his jailed father is also a case study of how to overcome big money, proper election strategy, robust social media teams, and past electoral experience of two big rivals. What also worked for Engineer Rashid was the ability of his campaign to wake up the boycott bastion that till date had been influenced by the separatist ideology of boycotting the democratic process. This segment of voters too came out in support of Rashid, as they felt that he was being punished for his \"unwavering commitment to uphold the dignity of the people\".\n\nPost Article 370 abrogation, while every political party in Kashmir that claimed to be fighting for its restoration seemed to have surrendered and moved on, Engineer Rashid was seen as a Lone Ranger who was being punished for not compromising on his principles.\n\nWhile this dramatic script was unfolding in North Kashmir, South and Central Kashmir witnessed the conventional electoral battle between two old rivals, the NC and the PDP. The PDP had a lot more at stake as far as the Anantnag parliamentary segment was concerned, not just because its party chief Mehbooba Mufti was in the fray, but also due to delimitation of the constituency. It was no more the erstwhile South Kashmir seat, considered a PDP bastion. It had been redrawn, with Poonch and Rajouri merged with Anantnag. So the equations had changed, and the NC strategy to field a strong Gujjar leader, Mian Altaf Ahmed, who also enjoyed a spiritual connect with the community, was a masterstroke.\n\nThe Gujjar vote consolidated for the National Conference, as Poonch and Rajouri have a sizeable Gujjar vote bank. This, along with a low voter turnout in the traditional pro-PDP zones of Anantnag and Kulgam, ensured Mehbooba Mufti had very little elbow room to re-strategise or turn the tide. Indeed, Mehbooba's loss in Anantnag is being seen as another body blow to the party, which is a pale shadow of its erstwhile self.\n\n\"I thank the people for their overwhelming support. It's a people's victory. I will try my best to work for the people. Mehbooba ji is like my sister, but in elections win and loss are destined,\" said Mian Altaf after his victory from the Anantnag seat.\n\nFor Kashmir, this general election was historic in many ways - as an all-time high voter turnout, with a majority of first-time voters casting their ballot for change. People reposed their faith in democracy, while expressing the hope that Jammu and Kashmir would see Assembly elections soon.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India

His win reflects the deep-rooted support and trust the people of North Kashmir have in his leadership and vision.\n\nRashid's win is a shocker since he contested the elections from Tihar jail, where he has been for the last five years facing charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)\n\nHe contested the election as an independent candidate. Since he was in jail, his two sons led his campaign, which started just two weeks before the Baramulla constituency voted in the fifth polling phase on May 20.\n\nAs the election results were announced, jubilant scenes unfolded across North Kashmir. Men, women, and children took to the streets, expressing their joy and solidarity with Rashid. The atmosphere was electric as firecrackers lit up the skies in Rashid's native village, and songs of victory echoed through the valleys.\n\nResidents voiced their hopes that Rashid's victory would lead to his prompt release. \"We believe this victory will pave the way for Engineer Rashid's freedom. He is a leader who truly understands the aspirations of the people,\" said a local supporter.\n\nIncarcerated for his vocal stance on various issues affecting the velley, Engineer Rashid's electoral triumph has not only sent ripples through the political landscape but also highlighted the resilience and determination of his supporters.\n\n\"We are optimistic that Rashid's win will bring about positive developments for North Kashmir,\" said another supporter amidst the celebrations.\"", "source": {"uri": "risingkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rising Kashmir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aatif_qayoom@risingkashmir.com", "name": "Aatif Qayoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer_Rashid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineer Rashid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baramulla", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langate_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Langate Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajjad_Gani_Lone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajjad Gani Lone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Abdullah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omar Abdullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Activities_(Prevention)_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.risingkashmir.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/04210701/images-13.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629330", "eventUri": "eng-9629330", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1027, "textEnd": 1033}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

'Vote se': Baramulla answers Engineer Rashid's call", "body": "Till Rashid joined the fray, the contest was seen as a two-cornered one, between prominent contenders Omar Abdullah of the National Conference and Sajad Lone of the People's Conference.\n\nWith Rashid in jail, his campaign was managed by his sons Abrar Rashid (23) and Asrar Rashid (21). They did not talk about Article 370 abrogation, identity issues or development, or bread-and-butter matters like road, electricity or water. Abrar's appeal was emotional, seeking votes so that his father could \"come out of jail\". He also sought votes against \"oppression\", as a \"revenge\" for his father's arrest.\n\nWhen he raised the slogan 'Tihar ka badla (the revenge for Tihar is)', the crowds would answer back, 'Vote se (With votes)'.\n\nMore than the campaigns run by mainstream parties, Rashid's tapped into the raw anger against the Centre over the unilateral scrapping of J&K's special status and stripping of its statehood, followed by a clampdown against voices of dissent.\n\nWhat Rashid also attracted was the boycott vote, which would earlier stay away from polling booths in the Valley, but which now saw a vote for him as a vote for resistance. Abrar addressed this directly in his poll speeches, saying: \"I know that you are the pro-boycott people. But promise me, this time you will come out to vote.\"\n\nThis vote is seen as having consolidated behind Rashid, given that Lone was dubbed a proxy of the BJP by his opponents, and the PDP and NC carried the baggage of alliances with the BJP in the past.\n\nOn May 20, when Baramulla voted, the turnout was as high as 58%, a huge jump from 35% in 2019.\n\nWhile his contest from behind bars underlined this even more prominently, Rashid's politics since his first foray into elections back in 2008 has always combined separatist politics with faith in democracy - thus putting him apart both from the mainstream and separatist leaders, and filling a crucial middle in the Valley.\n\nEven as the loss is embarrassing for Omar, it is a question of political relevance for Lone, once seen as the most popular leader of the frontier district of Kupwara. That space could now be filled by Rashid.\n\nRashid incidentally first gained prominence as an associate of former Hurriyat leader and Lone's father Abdul Gani Lone. In early 2000s, he became a known name in the Valley when he launched a campaign against alleged forced labour by the Army in Langate, his home Assembly segment.\n\nAfter Abdul Gani's assassination, Rashid sided with his son Sajad and they seemed ready to take the jump into electoral politics in 2008. But Sajad changed his mind after the Amarnath land row agitation, and Rashid parted ways to contest as an Independent for the Assembly elections. His goodwill in the Langate seat helped him win, but fostered a bitter rivalry with Sajad.\n\nIn the 2014 Assembly elections, Rashid won again. But then came 2019, and soon after Article 370 was revoked, Rashid was summoned by the National Investigation Agency to New Delhi and arrested in the money laundering case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Omar pointed to the fact that there was no sign of Rashid coming out of jail, and that his election to Parliament may not change that. Congratulating him in a post on X, the NC leader said: \"I don't believe his victory will hasten his release from prison nor will the people of North Kashmir get the representation they have a right to, but the voters have spoken and in a democracy that's all that matters\".", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

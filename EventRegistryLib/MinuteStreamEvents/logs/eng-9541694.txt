And we always want to see what Rihanna has for us.\n\nWe've got you covered with everything you need to know from how to watch to who is going to be at The Met. And you can follow along live with us as we share our favorite looks, best moments and all the fashion from the 2024 Met Gala.\n\nWe'll be at The Mark hotel in NYC where lots of celebs are getting ready. We also have our entertainment and fashion editor Anika Reed on the stairs of the Met for all of your best coverage.\n\nWhat does the Met exhibit look like?\n\nWe got a sneak peek Monday morning, with Anna Kaufman walking through the \"Sleeping Beauties\" exhibit.\n\nMet director and CEO Max Hollein shared the internal logic of the exhibit, which seems to be - fashion is to be felt, not just admired, and no number of years passed should preclude that original purpose. While you cannot touch the clothing on display, the museum has created clever ways to allow visitors to experience the fashion through all senses.\n\nDrawn exclusively from the Met's permanent collection, the exhibition houses some 220 pieces dating back to the 17th century, head curator Andrew Bolton told the crowd Monday. Many of the galleries showcase a \"sleeping beauty\" or a dress lying flat, too delicate to even stretch around a mannequin for display.\n\nSee the exhibit The Met Gala's theme is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. Here's what that looks like.\n\nWho is going to the Met Gala?\n\nThe list is kept secret each year, but we know the co-chairs of the event will be there. So you'll definitely see Latin music superstar Bad Bunny, actress and singer Jennifer Lopez, \"Euphoria\" actress and Hollywood A-lister Zendaya and \"Thor\" himself, Chris Hemsworth, who will join Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.\n\nHonorary chairs are Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. TikTok is the gala's sponsor this year, with support from Loewe.\n\nWe don't know if the Kardashians will all be there. But Kim Kardashian, Blake Lively and Beyonc\u00e9 - as well as Rihanna are expected.\n\nIs Taylor Swift going to the Met Gala?\n\nAll signs point to no. The singers resumes her Eras Tour in France on May 9. Even with a private jet, it seems the Grammy-winner won't be walking the carpet with Travis Kelce this year.\n\nThe 2016 Met Gala is where Swift supposedly met Joe Alwyn.\n\nWhat is Jennifer Lopez going to wear?\n\nIt's almost surprising that Jennifer Lopez has attended the Met Gala 13 times - with looks ranging from Catholic chainmail to 18th century lacey goddess.\n\nShe told Good Morning America that the night isn't about comfort. \"\"But it's exciting, it's exciting. It's a fun night for fashion,\" she said.\n\nWho was best-dressed at the 2023 Met Gala?\n\nOur eight favorite looks from last year included Rihanna and Dua Lipa.\n\nMore: Met Gala 2023 best dressed: See Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, more stars channel Karl Lagerfeld\n\nWhy is Rihanna so important to the Met Gala?\n\nRihanna is known for taking big fashion risks - from her pregnancy announcement to her iconic look at the Met Gala in 2018 that had her dubbed \"Pope Rihanna.\"\n\nShe is known as the unofficial queen of the Met Gala for nailing the themes.\n\nRihanna's evolving red carpet style, including her unforgettable Met Gala looks\n\nWhen is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is the first Monday in May, as is tradition. The exact date for the 2024 event is May 6.\n\nHow do I watch the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala will be livestreamed on Vogue's website and social media channels beginning at 6 p.m. ET. The \"hautest\" event of the year will air live on E! starting at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere is the Met Gala held?\n\nThe Met Gala is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Costume Institute Benefit, commonly known as Met Gala, is a fundraiser for the museum's Costume Institute. Last year, the event hit a record and raised over $22 million, according to Vogue Business.\n\nWe almost all think of the Gala as the red carpet on the giant steps leading to the actual event, which is closed to media. The steps are where we see all the looks, who each celebrity brought as their +1 (if they were granted a +1) and who wore what.\n\nInside, guests can tour the exhibit, have cocktails and then sit down for dinner. There is a strict no-phones policy, so the only photos that we typically see are bathroom selfies.\n\nWhy does the Met Gala matter?\n\nIt is the best night of fashion - far exceeding any awards show or fashion week. You bring together celebrities, designers, fashion people - and art. It's a night to impress - and the looks aren't meant to be wearable, but rather tell a story on the theme of the night.\n\nYou'll see experimental fashion, gowns you cannot sit down in, wild looks and beauty. We saw Zendaya wave goodbye to her Disney roots in a Cinderella ball gown, Kim Kardashian in in Marilyn Monroe's iconic \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress and Jared Leto \"feline\" himself as Karl Lagerfeld's famous Birman cat Choupette.\n\nHow much does it cost to go to the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is invitation only - and Vogue Editor Anna Wintour holds the list.\n\nTickets are $75,000 each, according to The New York Times, and even if you buy a table for $350,000, you don't get to pick where you sit. You can't simply buy your way in. The event holds about 400 people.\n\nWhat is this year's Met Gala theme?\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nThe \"sleeping beauties\" is not inspired by Disney princess, but rather treasured garments in the museum's collection that are so fragile that they need to be housed in special glass \"coffins\" rather than on mannequins, curators said. Garments will be displayed in a series of galleries organized by themes of nature.\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman, Anna Kaufman\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Met Gala live

This annual event is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and is an important night in the fashion world.\n\nThis year's benefit is arising the \"sleeping beauties\" of fashion, following last year's gala, which honored designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019.\n\nIconic moments at the Met Gala in the past include Zendaya waving goodbye to her Disney roots in a Cinderella ball gown, Kim Kardashian in Marilyn Monroe's iconic \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress and Jared Leto \"feline\" himself as Lagerfeld's pet Birman cat, Choupette.\n\nThink of the Met Gala as a royal ball in fairy tale movies. Here is what to know.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nMet Gala, also known as The Costume Institute Benefit, is actually a fundraiser that benefits the museum's Costume Institute. Last year, the event set a record and raised over $22 million, according to Vogue Business.\n\nIs the Met Gala the same every year?\n\nThere is a different theme every year, as it matches an exhibit at the Met. This year's theme for the benefit \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" also the name of the accompanying exhibit at the Costume Institute.\n\nThe \"sleeping beauties\" are not inspired by the Disney princess, but rather refer to treasured garments in the museum's collection that are so fragile that they need to be housed in special glass \"coffins\" rather than on mannequins, curators said. Garments will be displayed in a series of galleries organized by themes of nature.\n\nIs the Met Gala theme also the dress code?\n\nThe theme and the dress code are different, but related. This year's dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same title, according to Vogue.\n\nDoes the Met Gala have hosts?\n\nYes -- they're called co-chairs and honorary chairs who work with Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue. Chairs for the Met Gala are usually celebrities who actually do some work before the actual Gala, such as helping with decorations, choosing the menu, curating guest lists, and hosting the guests as they arrive. Think of it as a committee that's planning a big event.\n\nFor invited individuals, the cost of entry to this year's gala is $75,000, according to CBS.\n\nWhen is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is the first Monday in May, as is tradition. The exact date for the 2024 event is May 6.\n\nWhat time is the Met Gala red carpet? How to watch live, stream\n\nThe Met Gala will be livestreamed on Vogue's website and social media channels beginning at 6 p.m. ET, and will air live on E! starting at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nWho will be at the Met Gala?\n\nGuests at the Met Gala are typically a surprise, but the co-chairs are among the handful of confirmed attendees. Several guests at the Met Gala have already been confirmed, including Rihanna, Sydney Sweeney, Josh O'Connor, Mike Faist, Nicholas Galitzine and Kelsea Ballerini, according to Capital UK.\n\nRecent attendees have been Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Cardi B, Serena Williams, Usher, Doja Cat, Barry Keoghan and couple Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade. It's unclear if they will give their best on the carpet again this year.\n\nWhat happens after the red carpets?\n\nWhat happens inside the Met Gala event is not recorded. This night includes a dinner followed by performances, according to CBS. Cher, Rihanna, Madonna and Lady Gaga have performed at the Met Gala in years past, among the world's most coveted art and notable artists.\n\nAfter the Met Gala, attendees are invited to after-parties where brands and designers unleash more fashion moments.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nMet Gala 2024: The annual celebration is here! Every year, the most famous people turn to Met Gala in their trendiest outfits for an exclusive party. The Costume Institute Benefit -- officially known as the Met Gala -- raises funds at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is the most prestigious fashion event of the year, and this year's Met Gala will take place on May 6th.\n\nAs fashion enthusiasts eagerly await the Met Gala 2024, let's get to know about the buzz around this year's theme.\n\nMet Gala 2024 theme\n\nThe Met Gala 2024 theme focuses on \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" However, the gala itself is themed around \"The Garden of Time,\" drawing inspiration from J.G. Ballard's short story of the same name.\n\nMany might wonder what this theme entails, and how guests interpret it through their attire. So, the gala's dress code evokes a creative exploration of time and its manifestations. It invites attendees to embody elements of the story's narrative within their fashion choices.\n\nVogue has hinted at an expected surge of floral and botanical-inspired looks on the red carpet. The gala's theme, 'The Garden of Time', is sure to inspire attendees to embrace nature's beauty and incorporate it into their attire.\n\nThe gala's theme is divided into three main zones: Land, Sea, and Sky. It mirrors the richness of natural resources, inviting guests to explore themes of conservation.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\", \"will explore notions of rebirth and renewal, using nature as a metaphor for the impermanence of fashion.\"\n\nAt a press conference held in November, Andrew Bolton, the curator in charge of the Anna Wintour Costume Centre at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, revealed that the theme for the year 2024 would combine technological elements with fashion items that are generally lifeless in order to arouse the senses.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties will heighten our engagement with these masterpieces of fashion by evoking how they feel, move, sound, smell and interact when being worn\", said Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in a statement. \"Sleeping Beauties will ultimately offer a deeper appreciation of the integrity, beauty and artistic brilliance of the works on display.\"\n\nHow to watch Met Gala 2024 in India?\n\nIn India, Met Gala 2024 will be available for streaming beginning at 6:30 pm on May 6th.

Theme, guestlist, and what happens at the event", "body": "From Rihanna serving boujee priest, to Jared Leto's severed head and Kim Kardashian dressing head to toe (literally) in black, the Met Gala has given the world some truly iconic moments.\n\nAnd now, as the first Monday in May approaches, we're bracing ourselves for the most anticipated red carpet of the year.\n\nAnyone who follows Anna Wintour's annual celebrity bash will know that each year, the Met Gala, which takes place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has a theme.\n\nWhile each is more vague and confusing than the last, the A-listers attempt to do their best to look the part.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about this year's Met Gala theme - and who will be attending.\n\nSince 1948, the Met Gala has been held every year (apart from one break in 2020 due to the pandemic). Known as the 'fashion Oscars', it's actually a fundraising event, to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York.\n\nThe event marks the opening of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibition. Each year, the exhibition has a theme - hence the themed outfits we love to see on those now-famous stairs.\n\nVogue editor Anna Wintour is the lead chairperson of the event, and oversees the guest list - but just because you've been invited, it doesn't mean it won't cost you.\n\nTickets for the Met Gala this cost a reported $75,000 per person - that's $25,000 up on 2023. Typically, designers or brands will buy tickets themselves, and invite celebrities who, in exchange for a ticket, will have to wear that brand's clothes.\n\nAnd even then, every guest has to be approved by Anna, of course.\n\nThe event takes place on the first Monday in May every year, which means the 2024 Met Gala will be on Monday, May 6.\n\nThe museum itself is closed on that day to allow everyone to get ready for the festivities.\n\nIn 2020 the event was cancelled due to Covid, before returning in 2021, albeit four months late, when it was held in September.\n\nThe theme this year is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\n\nAccording to Vogue, Andrew Bolton, curator of the Costume Institute, said the exhibit will span 400 years of fashion history and focus on 50 historically significant pieces that are to delicate to be worn again. 'These are the 'Sleeping Beauties' of the title,' he said.\n\nPieces on display include an Elizabethan bodice and a satin silk ball gown. Many of the fragile exhibits will be shown along with the help of AI, CGI and light projection.\n\nDesigners featured will include: Phillip Lim, Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, among others.\n\nThis however, is not to be confused with the dress code, which is 'Garden of Time', inspired by the J.G. Ballard short story of the same name. A dystopian fiction, according to Vogue, the book (as well as the theme, and dress code) is about 'fleeting beauty'.\n\nLast year, the Met Gala theme was Karl Lagerfield: A Line of Beauty, which paid homage to the late creative director of Chanel.\n\nHowever, many disagreed that he should have been honoured in such a way, given various contentious comments made throughout his life.\n\nFrom the #MeToo movement to the Syrian refugee crisis and all things female bodies - there were many that disputed the fact Lagerfeld is a figure to honour on such a global scale.\n\nThis year, while far less controversial, the theme did raise a few eyebrows among some.\n\nMany will remember that in 2023, Kim Kardashian arrived at the event in a vintage gown that Marilyn Munroe wore to sing Happy Birthday to JFK in 1962.\n\nCritics questioned why the reality star had been allowed to wear a piece of fashion history, and Ripley's Believe It or Not, who lent Kim the dress, was widely criticised for allowing her to don the fragile gown.\n\nAfter the event, images were circulated by various sources which seemed to show damage to it, including stretched fabric and missing crystals.\n\nHowever, these claims were refuted by Ripley's vice-president of publishing and licensing, Amanda Joiner: 'From the bottom of the Met steps, where Kim got into the dress, to the top where it was returned, the dress was in the same condition it started in.'\n\nGiven that this year's theme is all about preserving and displaying historical fashion garments, some question whether Anna Wintour is having a little dig at Kim.\n\nEach year, the gala has co-chairs, who host the event along with Anna Wintour. The 2024 Met Gala hosts are Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth - meaning they're all going to be in attendance. This means we may also see Tom Holland and Ben Affleck join their spouses.\n\nZendaya hasn't been seen on the Met Gala red carpet since 2019, when she turned up looking incredible in a Cinderella-esque outfit, complete with a fairy godmother (her stylist) a wand, and a light-up gown.\n\nRihanna recently confirmed we'd be seeing her on the red carpet, telling Vogue she would be wearing 'Fenty something', but also stressing she'll go for a more modest look than previous years: 'I've had my nipples out, my panties out. But now... I guess as a mum and an evolved young lady... there are things I feel like I would never do.'\n\nAccording to a Page Six report, Met Gala newcomers for 2024 include actress Lily Gladstone, Ayo Edebiri, famous for her role in The Bear, and Saltburn star Barry Keoghan.\n\nPage Six also reported that Olivia Rodrigo, Uma Thurman and Sarah Paulson will be attending.\n\nWe can expect some regulars to show up too: Sarah Jessica Parker (she's been 11 times), Kendall Jenner - and a selection of other Karadashians - and Cara Delevingne.\n\nThere are some A-listers however who have publicly denounced the Met Gala. Tina Fey described it as a 'jerk parade' in 2010 and in 2013, Gwyneth Paltrow told USA today: 'I'm never going again. It was so un-fun,' but was left eating her words when she did in fact accept an invite in 2019. Comedian Amy Schumer has said that going to the Met Gala was 'punishment.'\n\nAnna Wintour has also reportedly banned some celebrities, these include Jameela Jamil and Lena Dunham.\n\nAnd it's bad news for Swifties, as we won't see Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce make their red carpet debut. Despite being invited, they have both declined.\n\nIn short, nobody really knows.\n\nAfter the guests disappear up the steps, it's a bit of a mystery. We know there's a dinner, and that there's an opportunity to wander around the exhibition.

Previous Rolling Stone cover star Emma Chamberlain also returns as a special correspondent.\n\nMet Gala 2024 Theme, Explained\n\nThis year's Met Gala theme is \"The Garden of Time,\" and attendees have been asked to make their dress inspired by the 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. The theme coincides with the Costume Institute'' new exhibit, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, which will be on display at the museum from May 10 to Sept. 2.\n\nRevisit: Most Memorable 2023 Met Gala Looks\n\nThe concept was created by Costume Institute chief curator Andrew Bolton, and the exhibit will spotlight 250 pieces from across four centuries, \"visually united by iconography related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal,\" according to the Met.\n\nMet Gala 2024 Guest List: Confirmed and Likely Stars\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala guest list is expected to include stars like Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri for the first time.

While it's not been confirmed yet, the Kardashians and Jenners will also most likely be in attendance.\n\nAnd fashion and music fans alike are always hoping for appearances from the likes of Harry Styles and Beyonce, though none of them have confirmed their attendance just yet for 2024.\n\nWhat Is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is an annual fundraiser and opening celebration of the Costume Institute's newest fashion exhibit. Unlike other A-list celebrity events like the Oscars and the Grammys, the prestigious Gala is not an awards ceremony. Those famous enough to be invited by Anna Wintour, the event's chairperson, will still have to fork over $30,000 for a single ticket or up to $300,000 for a table (oftentimes, fashion labels will pay the price of a celebrity's ticket in exchange for wearing their clothing).\n\nAs previously mentioned, this year's Costume Institute exhibition will be inspired by a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. The 1199-page tome traces the legendary writer's career, including tales about \"musical orchids, human cannibalism, or the secret history of World War III.\" The book's description aptly says the Complete Stories \"evokes the hallucinations of Kafka and Borges.\"\n\nYou don't need to have read the short story beforehand, so you can just tune into the Met Gala online without cable with a free trial to DirecTV Stream or fuboTV. Use it to stream the Met Gala carpet online free on E!, and choose to continue on with a subscription or cancel before your free trial is up.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_chan@rollingstone.com", "name": "Tim Chan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sage_anderson@rollingstone.com", "name": "Sage Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emma Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E!

Even with a private jet, it seems the Grammy-winner won't be walking the carpet with Travis Kelce this year.\n\nThe 2016 Met Gala is where Swift supposedly met Joe Alwyn.\n\nOur eight favorite looks from last year included Rihanna and Dua Lipa.\n\nMore: Met Gala 2023 best dressed: See Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, more stars channel Karl Lagerfeld\n\nRihanna is known for taking big fashion risks - from her pregnancy announcement to her iconic look at the Met Gala in 2018 that had her dubbed \"Pope Rihanna.\"\n\nShe is known as the unofficial queen of the Met Gala for nailing the themes.\n\nRihanna's evolving red carpet style, including her unforgettable Met Gala looks\n\nThe Met Gala is the first Monday in May, as is tradition. The exact date for the 2024 event is May 6.\n\nThe Met Gala will be livestreamed on Vogue's website and social media channels beginning at 6 p.m. ET. The \"hautest\" event of the year will air live on E! starting at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Met Gala is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City\n\nThe Costume Institute Benefit, commonly known as Met Gala, is a fundraiser for the museum's Costume Institute. Last year, the event hit a record and raised over $22 million, according to Vogue Business.\n\nWe almost all think of the Gala as the red carpet on the giant steps leading to the actual event, which is closed to media. The steps are where we see all the looks, who each celebrity brought as their +1 (if they were granted a +1) and who wore what.\n\nInside, guests can tour the exhibit, have cocktails and then sit down for dinner. There is a strict no-phones policy, so the only photos that we typically see are bathroom selfies.\n\nIt is the best night of fashion - far exceeding any awards show or fashion week. You bring together celebrities, designers, fashion people - and art. It's a night to impress - and the looks aren't meant to be wearable, but rather tell a story on the theme of the night.\n\nYou'll see experimental fashion, gowns you cannot sit down in, wild looks and beauty. We saw Zendaya wave goodbye to her Disney roots in a Cinderella ball gown, Kim Kardashian in in Marilyn Monroe's iconic \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress and Jared Leto \"feline\" himself as Karl Lagerfeld's famous Birman cat Choupette.\n\nThe Met Gala is invitation only - and Vogue Editor Anna Wintour holds the list.\n\nTickets are $75,000 each, according to The New York Times, and even if you buy a table for $350,000, you don't get to pick where you sit. You can't simply buy your way in. The event holds about 400 people.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nThe \"sleeping beauties\" is not inspired by Disney princess, but rather treasured garments in the museum's collection that are so fragile that they need to be housed in special glass \"coffins\" rather than on mannequins, curators said. Garments will be displayed in a series of galleries organized by themes of nature.\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

According to Vogue around 450 stars land an invite to the annual event.\n\nAnna Wintour, the global editorial director of Vogue, has become synonymous with the Met Gala since she started overseeing the event in 1995.\n\nWintour, who is also a Met trustee, appeared on TODAY May 6, ahead of the evening's festivities, and spoke to Jenna Bush Hager about prepping for the gala.\n\n\"It's relatively quiet,\" she shared. \"Everything is in the details. We plan these exhibitions in the evening so far in advance that if we're not relatively calm in this point, we're in big, big trouble.\"\n\nShe revealed that teams start working on each gala two or three years in advance.\n\nWintour joins a group of celebs every year who serve as co-chairs and help plan the gala.\n\nSo who will co-host the exhibition this year and what is the theme? Find out everything you need to know about the 2024 Met Gala below.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will kick off on Monday, May 6, at the historic Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan.\n\nAccording to Vogue, the Met Gala has been held the first Monday in May ever since Wintour took over as co-chair in 1995.\n\nThe tradition has continued since then with the exception of the 2021 Met Gala, which was postponed until September of that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLive coverage of the 2024 Met Gala arrivals will begin on Vogue.com starting at 6 p.m. ET. The livestream will also appear on the magazine's digital platforms, TikTok and YouTube.\n\nLa La Anthony, Ashley Graham and \"Wednesday\" star Gwendoline Christie will host the livestream. Internet personality Emma Chamberlain will be the magazine's special correspondent on the red carpet.\n\nIn addition to Wintour, a few celebrities are asked every year to co-host the event. For the 2024 Met Gala, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth will be the co-chairs along with two honorary chairs: Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Chew.\n\nOn TODAY, Wintour complimented each co-chair. She mentioned that this year's Met Gala will mark Lopez's 14th visit to the Costume Institute opening. The editor also gushed about Bad Bunny after seeing him perform recently in Brooklyn.\n\n\"And then Zendaya, you know, a couple of years when she couldn't come, I felt gloom hung over the internet. Like, you know, a cloud of sad emojis because everyone always looks forward to what she's gonna wear. And I know she will not disappoint,\" Wintour said.\n\nFor the Marvel star, she playfully added, \"Who would be a better prince than Chris Hemsworth to wake up the sleeping beauties? And I can only talk for the corridors of Vogue, but the level of excitement when his name was mentioned rose several degrees. And I dare to guess that it might be the same here at the Met, too.\"\n\nLast year, Michaela Coel, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa were co-hosts.\n\nInvitations to the Met Gala are usually hidden from the general public. The guest list isn't officially confirmed until the celebrities arrive on the red carpet.\n\nAll the actors, musicians, athletes and models who attend the Met Gala are selected months in advance.\n\n\"We start with a seating document when the names come together in December,\" Eaddy Kiernan, who organizes the seating chart, told Vogue.\n\n\"The actual seating chart doesn't come together until about a month before the event, when we get a sense for the layout of the room, and the flow of the evening,\" Kiernan revealed.\n\nKiernan said her team meticulously maps out which celebrities will be at the same table.\n\n\"We really try to think very carefully about who's sitting next to each other. Our ideal pairing would maybe be two people who we think will just get on like a house on fire, but who may not even realize that they have a lot in common. So with each person, we really do take time to think, 'What will they talk about?'\" she explained.\n\nAlthough we won't know who received an invitation until May 6, there are a few stars who make dramatic entrances almost every year. Rihanna, Blake Lively, and Jared Leto are some of the celebrities who always deliver a unique interpretation of the theme. Viewers should also expect to see the Kardashian-Jenner family posing for photos -- at least one family member has attended the Met Gala since 2013.\n\n\"It's often wonderful to hear after dinner, people say, 'Oh, we had the most wonderful conversations.' And so that's the idea -- that life can exist without a picture on your cell phone,\" she explained.\n\nSo are chives, onions and garlic, Wintour confirmed to TODAY. \"Those are three things I'm not particularly fond of. And so yes. That's true,\" she said.\n\nThe dress code of each Met Gala is paired to the spring exhibition at the Met's Costume Institute.\n\nWintour said this year's exhibition broke her \"cardinal rule.\"\n\n\"We came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties.' It's wonderful, it's poetic, its romantic, but actually it could be many, many things,\" she said.\n\nThat, paired with the \"Garden of Time\" dress code, she said, may have caused mixed signals.\n\n\"I fear we have unleashed a lot of confusion out there for which I deeply apologize,\" she contined.\n\nThe new exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" features about 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's archives.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties\" is not a reference to the classic fairytale, \"but rather the celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile that it can't ever be worn again -- and are thus sleeping beauties in the scrupulous archives of the Costume Institute,\" Vogue explained.\n\nDuring Wintour's appearance on TODAY, she spoke more about the meaning behind \"Sleeping Beauties.\"\n\n\"The idea of 'Sleeping Beauties' is taking these masterpieces from different periods. And because so many of them are very fragile, and have to be laid flat, they can't even be displayed on a mannequin or in any other way. They are laid flat, behind glass wall and around them are the inspirations that are muses, as (curator Andrew Bolton) calls them,\" she said.\n\nWhen speaking about the exhibition to TODAY, Bolton said, \"The idea is to try and reawaken garments in our collection through the senses. So, you're gonna be able to smell a garment, you'll hear it. You can't wear it, but you can see something being in movement.\"\n\nHe later explained, \"Nature's the throughline throughout the exhibition.\"\n\nThe paired dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by the 1962 short story of the same name written by J. G. Ballard, Vogue reported.\n\nBallard wrote about two married aristocrats who are under attack. The couple lives in a castle with a garden that contains magical flowers. When the flowers are removed from the stem, the garden loses time and motion.\n\nGuests might choose to embrace the floral aspect or focus on the importance of time and fragility.\n\nWintour predicted there would be plenty of flowers on the red carpet and hinted that her gown might have floral elements.\n\nIn 2023, the Met Gala paid tribute to iconic German designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019 at 85, with the theme of \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.\"\n\nMultiple celebrities honored Largerfeld with their looks, like Anne Hathaway, Lily Collins, Keke Palmer, Brian Tyree Henry, Jessica Chastain, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky.\n\nAs Jenna mentioned on TODAY, the 2023 Met Gala raised $22 million.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType":

This year, the Vogue editor-in-chief will be joined by co-hosts Bad Bunny, Zendaya, first-time attendee Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez, and the honorary chairs Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. Previous Rolling Stone cover star Emma Chamberlain also returns as a special correspondent.\n\nThis year's Met Gala theme is \"The Garden of Time,\" and attendees have been asked to make their dress inspired by the 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. The theme coincides with the Costume Institute'' new exhibit, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, which will be on display at the museum from May 10 to Sept. 2.\n\nRevisit: Most Memorable 2023 Met Gala Looks\n\nThe concept was created by Costume Institute chief curator Andrew Bolton, and the exhibit will spotlight 250 pieces from across four centuries, \"visually united by iconography related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal,\" according to the Met.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala guest list is expected to include stars like Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri for the first time. Additionally, there are reports that Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, Barry Keoghan and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps.\n\nDesigners expected to make the Met Gala guest list include Stella McCartney, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, and Tom Ford. While it's not been confirmed yet, the Kardashians and Jenners will also most likely be in attendance.\n\nAnd fashion and music fans alike are always hoping for appearances from the likes of Harry Styles and Beyonce, though none of them have confirmed their attendance just yet for 2024.\n\nThe Met Gala is an annual fundraiser and opening celebration of the Costume Institute's newest fashion exhibit. Unlike other A-list celebrity events like the Oscars and the Grammys, the prestigious Gala is not an awards ceremony. Those famous enough to be invited by Anna Wintour, the event's chairperson, will still have to fork over $30,000 for a single ticket or up to $300,000 for a table (oftentimes, fashion labels will pay the price of a celebrity's ticket in exchange for wearing their clothing).\n\nAs previously mentioned, this year's Costume Institute exhibition will be inspired by a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. The 1199-page tome traces the legendary writer's career, including tales about \"musical orchids, human cannibalism, or the secret history of World War III.\" The book's description aptly says the Complete Stories \"evokes the hallucinations of Kafka and Borges.\"\n\nYou don't need to have read the short story beforehand, so you can just tune into the Met Gala online without cable with a free trial to DirecTV Stream or fuboTV. Use it to stream the Met Gala carpet online free on E!, and choose to continue on with a subscription or cancel before your free trial is up.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emma Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E!

This year, the Met Gala livestream will feature actor Gwendoline Christie, producer and actor La La Anthony, and model Ashley Graham as hosts.Fashion enthusiasts worldwide are excited about the Met Gala 2024, an annual spectacle held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This year, the event promises to dazzle with its theme \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" honoring treasured garments from the museum's collection. Here's all you need to know about this extravagant affair:\n\nAs per a report by USA Today, the Met Gala is scheduled for May 6 and will commence at 6 p.m. ET. Fashion enthusiasts can tune in to Vogue's website and social media channels for a livestream of the event. Additionally, E! will broadcast the gala live, ensuring viewers don't miss a moment of the haute couture extravaganza.\n\nThe Met Gala serves as a fundraiser for the museum's esteemed Costume Institute. Last year's event set a remarkable record, raising over $22 million to support the institute's endeavors, as reported by Vogue Business, according to a report by USA Today.\n\nWhile the theme of the starry night is \"sleeping beauties\" it is not at all inspired by Disney Princesses. Interestingly, this year's theme is inspired by delicate garments housed in the museum's collection, also known as \"sleeping beauties.\" These fragile treasures have special glass encasements, similar to coffins, rather than conventional mannequins. The accompanying exhibit at the Costume Institute will showcase these garments, organized per the theme around the elements of nature: Land, Sea, and Sky.\n\nWhile distinct from the theme, the dress code for the Met Gala 2024 is equally powerful. Entitled \"The Garden of Time,\" it is inspired by J.G. Ballard's short story, as per Vogue. Attendees have been asked to interpret the theme with \"melancholic florals\", as mentioned in the Vogue report.\n\nWhile guest lists remain a secret till the event begins, past attendees such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Cardi B, and Serena Williams have graced the Met Gala with their presence. With a star-studded ensemble of co-chairs and honorary chairs, this year's gala promises to attract an equally illustrious array of attendees, though surprises are part of the extravagant night.\n\nRenowned personalities spearhead the Met Gala as co-chairs and honorary chairs. According to a USA Today report, Latin music sensation Bad Bunny, Hollywood icons Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya, with Chris Hemsworth, will be joining forces with Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour to orchestrate the event's splendor. Additionally, Jonathan Anderson, Loewe's creative director, and Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, serve as honorary chairs, with TikTok sponsoring this year's gala.\n\nWhat is the 2024 Met Gala theme?\n\nThe theme of this year's Met Gala draws inspiration from the latest exhibition by the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" \"When an item of clothing enters our collection, its status is changed irrevocably\", as mentioned in a report by Vogue.\n\nWho will host the Met Gala in 2024?\n\nThe 2024 event boasts an all-star lineup of celebrities, including Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Zendaya, who will co-chair alongside Wintour.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The annual Met Gala returns to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6th as has been its custom since 2005: the event has occurred on the first Monday in May except in 2020 when it wasn't held at all and in September 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Met Gala or Met Ball officially known as The Costume Institute Gala is an annual fundraising gala held for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Costume Institute in Manhattan and it will be held at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art which has served as its venue since its inception in 1948.\n\nConsidered to be the most prestigious, glamourous and highest profile fashion event of the year, the Met Gala has housed all the biggest and most famous names in the fashion, art, and music industries and it promises to be another unforgettable night of fashion and fundraising as invitees showcase looks that properly represent and interpret the theme of the year.\n\nVogue's iconic editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, has been a champion of the Costume Institute for decades and to honour her dedication, the Institute's home is now named the Anna Wintour Costume Center.\n\nThe Met Gala this year draws inspiration from the Costume Institute's exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". However, the main event itself has a separate dress code: \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThis intriguing theme is inspired by a 1962 J.G. Ballard short story of the same name, hinting at a deeper exploration of the connection between fashion and the fleeting nature of life set against a backdrop of nature.\n\nThe exhibit will feature approximately 250 rare items drawn from the Costume Institute's permanent collection.

The exact date for the 2024 event is May 6.\n\nWhat time is the Met Gala red carpet?

Garments will be displayed in a series of galleries organized by themes of nature.\n\n\"More modern, less delicate pieces imbued with the same spirit as the spotlight fashions will be showcased alongside them, and broken up into three sub-themes: Land, Sea, and Sky,\" per Vogue.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2024 dress code?\n\nThe theme is different from the dress code, but still related. This year's dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by J.G.

It's on the storied steps of the New York City art museum that award-winning actors, fashion designers, titans of technology, supermodels, influencers, professional athletes, and more come together to show off their sartorial sensibilities in support of the Costume Institute. Want to watch the Met Gala 2024 live stream? Tune in here.\n\nThe Met Gala is traditionally held on the first Monday in May. The 2024 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 6, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, located near Central Park on New York City's Upper East Side. The ultraexclusive event is more than a glamorous night out; it is a ticketed fundraiser that supports the Costume Institute's exhibitions, publications, acquisitions, operations, and more. It also marks the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition.\n\nAs for what the attendees will be wearing, the 2024 Met Gala dress code is \"the Garden of Time.\" It's inspired by a 1962 short story written by J.G. Ballard. Like every Met Gala theme, it is open to interpretation by the evening's guests and could result in a range of renditions -- including ones featuring colorful florals, garlands of ivy, and dramatic timepieces. The \"Garden of Time\" theme connects to the Costume Institute's spring exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" Featuring approximately 250 objects, the show hopes to \"reactivate the sensory capacities of masterworks in the museum's collection through firsthand research, conservation analysis, and diverse technologies -- from cutting-edge tools, artificial intelligence, and computer-generated imagery to traditional formats of X-rays, video animation, light projection, and soundscapes,\" according to a press release from The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The objects will be united by iconography related to nature, which, the museum says, will serve as a metaphor \"for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion.\"\n\nThe Met Gala red carpet is unique in that each guest is allotted a time slot for their entrance. Arrivals on the Met Gala red carpet usually begin around 5:30 p.m., often with the event's hosts. The 2024 Met Gala's cochairs are Anna Wintour, Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny, while Shou Chew, chief executive officer of TikTok, and Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe, will serve as honorary chairs.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Art museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The glamorous occasion -- which is sometimes also referred to as the Met Ball -- first began in 1948 when fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert created it as a philanthropic opportunity for New York society (Lambert also founded New York Fashion Week, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and the International Best-Dressed List). While what's in fashion has surely changed since then, the Met Gala's role as a benefit has not. According to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Met Gala provides the Costume Institute \"with its primary source of funding for annual exhibitions, publications, acquisitions, operations, and capital improvements.\"\n\nEvery year, a lengthy red carpet sprawled out across the New York City landmark's iconic steps welcomes an exclusive guest list consisting of designers, actors, athletes, supermodels, tech gurus, billionaires, and more as they make their way toward the museum in their themed finery.

This will give viewers an inside look at one of the most extravagant -- and star-studded -- events of the year.\n\nThe event, as always, will take place in New York City at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. It will celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nBelow, find out how to watch the 2024 Met Gala livestream, what the theme means, who will attend, and everything else you need ahead of Met Monday.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and the official dress code is \"The Garden of Time.\" As always, attendees interpret each year's theme differently, so expect to see looks that are literal and others that are purely conceptual. The event's curators told Vogue that the exhibition will be shaped around three main zones -- Land, Sea, and Sky -- that pay tribute to the natural world.\n\nThe exhibit will feature approximately 250 rare items from the Costume Institute's permanent collection that span more than 400 years of fashion history, including designs by some of the world's most revered fashion visionaries and houses including Dior, Schiaparelli, Givenchy, and more. According to Vogue, some of the garments are too fragile to wear -- including a Charles Frederick Worth ball gown from 1877 -- and will be displayed via video animation, light projection, AI, CGI, and other forms of sensory stimulation.\n\nIn addition to Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour, this year's celebrity co-chairs are multi-hyphenate Jennifer Lopez, actor Zendaya, musician Bad Bunny, and actor Chris Hemsworth.\n\nOrganized and presided over by Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala has become a truly iconic yearly celebration of high fashion (it's known colloquially as \"the Oscars of Fashion.\") A fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, it's usually timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition in May of every year. The one exception was in 2021, when the gala was held in September due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Who did Anna Wintour ban this year? All the burning questions, answered.\n\nIt's the first Monday in May, which can only mean one thing: The Met Gala 2024 is upon us. (Also: tree pollen is off the Richter scale, but that's not nearly as chic.)\n\nHere's everything you need to know about this year's so-called \"fashion Oscars,\" otherwise known as the annual charity gala that reliably raises tens of millions for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York City -- and is a reliable showcase for sartorial peacocking by a guest list that's hand-plucked from the style and celebrity firmament by Vogue's editor-in-chief and the event's driving force, Anna Wintour.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts What is the theme of the 2024 Met Gala?\n\nThis year's official dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" which Vogue, the official media mouthpiece of the Met Gala, says was inspired by a 1962 short story by the English novelist J.G. Ballard. Coles Notes: It's dystopian science fiction about a garden filled with flowers that can slow down (but not stop) the passage of time, and there's an angry mob en route to attack the garden's aristocratic owners.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt seems the Met Gala will lean more into the enchanted garden's nature theme than the juxtaposition of a countess playing her harpsichord as the downtrodden proletariat storm the walls of her Arcadia in a society plagued by inequality. Says Vogue, \"We'll likely see many a floral and botanical look grace the famed Met Gala red carpet.\" Some have pointed out the \"delicious irony\" of an event that charges $300,000 for a table choosing this story as its theme in a time of financial hardship, such as this BBC article.\n\nAs is tradition, the broader theme is tied to a new exhibit at the Costume Institute. This year, it's \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which will feature 250 \"rare\" items from the museum's collection that encompass 400 years of fashion history, and will include high-tech simulacrums of pieces that are too fragile to be displayed. The exhibit is loosely organized into land, sea and sky-themed zones. \"It is very much an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion,\" says curator Andrew Bolton.\n\nWho are the co-chairs for this year's Met Gala?\n\nThis year's co-chairs are Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth. This A-list group bring guaranteed star power to the event, but apparently are also put to work helping to curate the guest list and nail down the theme. They also give a speech on the night, not that we plebes will ever see it: While the red carpet is a public spectacle, once guests enter the museum itself the event is a strictly no camera zone where a veil of secrecy over proceedings descends.\n\nWhich celebrities will be at the Met Gala this year?\n\nIt's never guaranteed until they actually show up on the famous carpeted stairs, but this year's rumoured guests include Beyonc\u00e9, Ariana Grande, Pamela Anderson, Gigi Hadid, Sydney Sweeney, Amanda Seyfried, Lea Michele, several Kardashian-Jenners, crowd favourite Blake Lively and previous co-chair Dua Lipa.\n\nRihanna, who made a dramatically late entrance to last year's Met Gala, has actually confirmed she'll be attending, and that she'll be wearing something from one of her Fenty brands. (Whether that's skincare, makeup or lingerie is unclear.)\n\nWe've also got a few confirmed \"no\" RSVPs, notably Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, and Jared Leto, who last year attended dressed as Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette.\n\nIs there any controversy surrounding the Met Gala this year?\n\nDoubling down on that \"delicious irony\" aspect of the theme, there's a strong chance that this enchanted garden of rarified privilege may have its own dissatisfied crowd to deal with. Unionized workers from Cond\u00e9 Nast, the media company that owns Vogue, have threatened to set up a picket line outside the event. \"Meet us at the table or meet us at The Met on Monday,\" the union posted on social media on Saturday.\n\nThere's also an Italian model, Eugenio Casnighi, currently going viral on TikTok for claiming he was \"fired\" from working as a greeter on the red carpet after he \"upstaged\" Kylie Jenner at last year's gala when the Internet couldn't get enough of him when he appeared in the background of a picture of her.\n\nHow can I watch the Met Gala?\n\nVogue will be live streaming it on vogue.com and we will be sharing the highlights from the red carpet on thestar.com as the evening gets underway.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_laing@thestar.com", "name": "Sarah Laing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The first Monday in May has arrived, and we have everything you need to know about fashion's biggest night -- including the Met Gala 2024 theme, explained in layman's terms. This year's Costume Institute exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the Met Gala, will be \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" Keep in mind, the dress code is \"The Garden of Time.\" So yes, florals...for spring.\n\nThe core exhibition will span 400 years of history, from a 17th-century English Elizabethan-era bodice to 21st-century acquisitions by designers including Phillip Lim, Stella McCartney, and Connor Ives. Andrew Bolton, who is the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, explained that the exhibition will be structured around approximately 50 historically significant and aesthetically beautiful pieces that are far too fragile to ever be worn again.\n\nThe exhibition always opens with the Met Gala, which takes place every year on the first Monday in May at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Here's everything you need to know about the 2024 Met Gala -- fashion's biggest night out.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 6, in New York. The event has taken place on the first Monday in May every year since 2005, apart from in 2020, when the Met Gala was canceled, and in 2021, when it was held in September, as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThe spring 2024 exhibit is entitled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The exhibition will be structured around approximately 50 historically significant and aesthetically beautiful pieces from the collection that are far too fragile ever to be worn again. \"These are the 'Sleeping Beauties' of the title,\" Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, explained. Cutting-edge curation and technology will give a deeper understanding of these fragile pieces -- an illusion technique known as Pepper's ghost will be used to revive some looks, while video animation, light projection, soundscaping, AI, CGI, and other forms of sensory stimulation will provide a deeper context to each piece, according to Vogue's Luke Leitch.\n\n\"Fashion is one of the most emotional artistic forms because of its connection to the body,\" Bolton continued. \"It is imbued with memory and emotions, and we relate to it very much via our senses. One thing I hope this show will activate is that sensorial appreciation of fashion.\" The exhibition will be open to the public the day after the Met Gala and will run until September 2, 2024.\n\n\"The Garden of Time,\" as announced in February.\n\nIn addition to Anna Wintour, this year's celebrity cochairs are Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nOrganized and presided over by Anna Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala has become a much-loved annual celebration of fashion. A fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, it has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums.\n\nThe Met Gala 2023 theme was \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" in tribute to the legendary designer who died in 2019. As in previous years, Bolton was in charge of the exhibition -- which he said was not a \"traditional retrospective\" -- while Amanda Harlech, who worked closely with Lagerfeld, served as the show's creative consultant. Fittingly, the Met Gala dress code was \"In Honor of Karl\" -- with many guests drawing inspiration from the creative director's tenures at Chanel, Fendi, Chlo\u00e9, Patou, and his own eponymous brand.", "source": {"uri": "glamour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamour.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Ives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor Ives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Lim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phillip Lim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabethan era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_McCartney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stella McCartney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Lagerfeld", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Lagerfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlo\u00e9", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chlo\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fendi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Assemblage_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Assemblage Art", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654be3fec92f5d7e0e128c41/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1487161337?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1249, "textEnd": 1254}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He carried a 26-foot cape with flower details and finished the look with pearl stud earrings.\n\nIt was designer Simone Porte Jacquemus' first time at the Met Gala and he told Vogue he knew who he wanted to bring as his guest.\n\n\"Bad Bunny is my favorite artist, it's a dream to dress him for my first Met Gala,\" Jacqumeus said in the interview. \"I was so inspired by him, he is the ultimate Jacquemus muse.\"\n\nMichaela Coel dripping in gold, 2023 Met Gala\n\nMichaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings.\n\nThe \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who told Vogue she \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\"\n\n\"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover of American Vogue,\" Coel said in a behind-the-scenes interview as she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\"\n\nHer fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.\n\nDoja Cat goes full cat, 2023 Met Gala\n\nLove it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.\n\nDoja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like.\n\nThe Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\"\n\nChoupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, has her own Instagram account with more than a quarter million followers.\n\nBlake Lively's NYC inspired gown, 2022 Met Gala\n\nBlake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier Versace gown for the 2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"\n\nLively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.\n\nHusband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.\n\nLively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece.\n\nLil Nas X's big reveal, 2021 Met Gala\n\nSpeaking of epic entrances, Lil Nas X put on a show at the 2021 Met Gala with three distinct looks from Donatella Versace.\n\nHe started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.\n\nThe fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"\n\nThe artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.\n\nIman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala\n\nNobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best.\n\nHer outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.\n\nReed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"\n\nIman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie.\n\nMaluma's red leather suit, 2021 Met Gala\n\nMaluma was the first reggaet\u00f3n artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope.\n\nHe joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.\n\n\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"\n\nHe also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.\n\nZendaya's light-up Cinderella look, 2019 Met Gala\n\nZendaya joins Bad Bunny as this year's co-chairs, and the fairy princess is quickly becoming a queen of the Met Gala. First there was Joan of Arc in 2018, then her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"\n\nWith the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.\n\nRoach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.\n\nAs for this year's look, he says Zendaya's dress won't even be fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview published Thursday. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"\n\nTime to work their Met Gala magic.\n\nKardashian family photo, 2019 Met Gala\n\nThe Kardashians walked The Met steps together for the 2019 Met Gala and posed for an epic family photo.\n\nKim Kardashian donned a skin-tight corset dress from Thierry Mugler that looked as though she had just emerged from water. She was accompanied by her then-husband Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.\n\nHer sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott.\n\nAnd of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that was reportedly a last-minute suggestion from Kylie.\n\nThe Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021.\n\nBilly Porter goes for gold, 2019 Met Gala\n\nOh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages.\n\nPorter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, he told Vogue that \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\"\n\nPorter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look.\n\n\"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said.\n\nLady Gaga's many looks, 2019 Met Gala\n\nBefore Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme.\n\nLady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath.\n\nThen she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots.\n\nThe whole theatrical performance lasted about 15 minutes and sent the crowd into a frenzy.\n\nCardi B's giant feathered gown, 2019 Met Gala\n\nCardi B made a bold statement in head-to-toe ruby red at the 2019 Met Gala. Her feathered gown featured a hood, giant train and reportedly 44 carats worth of rubies on the bodice.\n\nDesigner Thom Browne told Vogue he created this dress for her because she \"has the ultimate beauty in a woman's body.\"\n\nThe Bronx rapper was also covered in jewels at the 2018 Met Gala, when she was several months pregnant with her first child, daughter Kulture.\n\n\"Wifey is the truth, she just killed the Met Gala,\" her then-husband, Migos rapper OFFSET, posted on social media after the 2019 gala.\n\nJared Leto holds his head, Met Gala 2019\n\nJared Leto has been known for his extreme costumes, and the 2019 Met Gala was no different. He turned heads with a lifelike prop that looked much like his own head.\n\nAccording to Vogue, Leto took a page from Gucci's Fall 2018 runway show when model Unia Pakhomova carried a replica of her head as a clutch. His red gown and crystal harness were designed by Alessandro Michele for the fashion house.\n\nLeto outdid himself in 2023 when he showed up in a fluffy, full-body cat suit.\n\nSadly for his fans, he is reportedly sitting out the 2024 Met Gala because his band, \"30 Seconds to Mars,\" is touring in Europe.\n\nKaty Perry's heavenly wings, 2018 Met Gala\n\n\"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" was the Met Gala theme in 2018, and Katy Perry soared in a giant set of angel wings from Versace.\n\nShe rocked a platinum blonde pixie cut with a gold mini dress and thigh-high boots. On top of that sat her huge wings that stretched from the floor to well above her head.\n\nThe singer pulled up in a vintage convertible before posing with the wings on The Met steps.\n\nIt was a toss-up between this and her outfit the following year, when she wore a crystal chandelier on her head and then dressed in a burger suit for the afterparty.\n\nFrances McDormand has fun with a headpiece, 2018 Met Gala\n\nFrances McDormand had the most fun with a whimsical headpiece from Valentino at the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nThe Oscar winner was photographed striking her best movie-star-pose as the massive headpiece nearly covered her whole face.\n\nShe was later seen in a social media video rocking out to the song \"Where's Your Head At\" inside the museum.\n\nTwo years later, McDormand appeared on the cover of Vogue, telling the publication, \"to still be culturally relevant as a 63-year-old female is so deeply, deeply gratifying.\"\n\nRihanna's epic yellow entrance, 2015 Met Gala\n\nIt was almost impossible to pick the best Rihanna look, but her arrival for the 2015 Met Gala stole the show.\n\nThe giant yellow gown was designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei for that year's theme, \"China: Through the Looking Glass.\" Her dramatic train seems to have ushered in era of these dresses and their grand entrances.\n\nRihanna had back-to-back hits for the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: The Art of the In-Between\" theme in 2017 and for \"Heavenly Bodies\" in 2018.\n\nThen, of course, in 2021, she walked the red carpet with her partner, A$AP Rocky, while pregnant with their first child, RZA, and again in 2023 while expecting their second son, Riot Rose.\n\nBeyonce's nearly-there naked dress, 2015 Met Gala\n\nThe naked dress isn't exactly new, but jaws dropped when Beyonc\u00e9 walked in wearing this to the 2015 Met Gala.\n\nThe floor-length dress from Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci featured strategically placed jewels but was otherwise see-through.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's stylist Ty Hunter says her 2015 gown was the heaviest one to wear.\n\n\"A lot of the rhinestones and gems, the rocky crystals, they were very heavy,\" he told Women's Wear Daily. \"It looked like the lightest ones because she looked naked under it, but it was one of the heaviest.\"\n\nSolange Knowles' fan dress, 2015 Met Gala\n\nQueen Bey's younger sister also made the list for the 2015 Met Gala with a head-scratching mini dress.\n\nSolange Knowles sported a futuristic design from Giles. While she told Refinery29 the dress \"gave the illusion of the fan,\" others compared it to an oyster, a sting ray or a computer background.\n\nSolange is known for taking fashion risks, and in 2018 she made headlines for asking her followers to vote for her outfit.\n\nAndre Leon Talley, a red carpet staple, 2015 Met Gala\n\nAndre Leon Tally was a fixture at the Met Gala since 1974 and he hosted its red carpet correspondence until 2018. The former Vogue creative director died of a heart attack in 2022 at the age of 73.\n\nHe is seen here leaving The Mark Hotel as he prepares to host the 2015 Met Gala. That year, he praised Rihanna's gown as \"indulgent\" and \"luxurious,\" calling her the \"queen of the night.\"\n\nTalley's fashion career began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute where he took an unpaid apprenticeship under Diana Vreeland. Those who knew him said he didn't merely study fashion, he was obsessed with it since his childhood. He went on to work for Women's Wear Daily and Vogue, ultimately becoming the first Black man to be named creative director.\n\nKate Moss in metallic, 2009 Met Gala\n\nSupermodel Kate Moss was the darling of the 2009 Met Gala in a metallic mini dress and matching headwrap from Marc Jacobs. That year's theme was \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion,\" and she couldn't have been more right for the part.\n\nMoss and Jacobs have worked on runways and campaigns together since the 1990s, dating back to his controversial grunge collection.\n\nMoss also gets points for her 1995 Met Gala look, when she wore a pale yellow Calvin Klein slip dress with a plunging back.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker with Alexander McQueen, 2006 Met Gala\n\nIt goes without saying, but Sarah Jessica Parker is always one to watch at the Met Gala. Her career has seen countless head-turning looks, from a thrifted dress for her first Met Gala in 1995 to her oversized mohawk for the 2013 theme \"Punk: Chaos to Couture.\"\n\nOne look that stands out is her outfit for the 2006 Met Gala theme \"Anglomania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion.\" She walked in with Alexander McQueen wearing a short dress while he wore a jacket, tie and kilt, and they both had coordinating plaid sashes.\n\nParker later told Vogue she was nervous because she deeply admired the late designer and even kept scraps of fabric he used from their dress fittings.\n\nLiv Tyler & Stella McCartney \"rock royalty,\" 1999 Met Gala\n\nThe 1999 Met Gala theme was \"Rock Style,\" so who better to make a splash than Liv Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, and Stella McCartney, daughter of The Beatles' Paul McCartney?\n\nThe duo attended the gala together in matching shirts with the words, \"Rock Royalty\" scrawled on them. McCartney told Vogue she took a pack of Haynes shirts to a vintage shop in Little Italy, where she helped customize the final design.\n\n\"I didn't come at it intentionally to be rebellious at all. I didn't know what people wore,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't really appropriate that we wore those shirts. Officially, we weren't following the honors of the dress code. It was very cool and rebellious of Stella,\" Tyler added.\n\nPrincess Diana's silk slip, 1996 Met Gala\n\nFrom rock to royals, Princess Diana's appearance at the 1996 Met Gala goes down in history as one of the most memorable moments. The theme that year was \"Christian Dior.\"\n\nPrincess Diana made a statement in a blue floor-length silk slip dress from John Galliano for Dior and a pearl choker. Vogue described it as her \"most un-royal look to date,\" and said it signaled her freedom after her divorce and departure from the royal family.\n\nDozens of other royals have attended the gala over the years, including the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece who made multiple appearances in 1989, 1995 and 2001.\n\nGianni & Donatella Versace in leather and gold, 1996 Met Gala\n\nVersace's designs have come up several times on this list, and the siblings behind the brand are on here for their leather and gold look at the 1996 Met Gala. That year's theme was Christian Dior.\n\nGianni Versace was the theme the following year, months after he was murdered outside his Miami Beach home.\n\nHis sister, Donatella Versace, took over the fashion house and has been a staple of the Met Gala since the 1990s. She dressed some of the biggest stars, and early photos show her arriving with Naomi Campbell in 1995 and posing for a photo with Madonna and Cher in 1997.\n\nNaomi Campbell's sparkle dress, 1995 Met Gala\n\nSpeaking of Naomi Campbell, she made quite the entrance in this shimmering, floor-length gown at the Met Gala in 1995, themed \"Haute Couture.\"\n\n\"I loved this dress. It was slim-fitting and body-hugging, and just glistened,\" she told Vogue in a 2020 interview. \"I remember when I saw this dress for the first time, I thought, wow, Gianni, is that for me? It seemed like one of those dresses that you read in those fairytale books.\"\n\nCampbell made her Met Gala debut in 1990 wearing a multi-colored mini dress also from Gianni Versace.\n\n\"I was in such awe to first be invited by Gianni Versace through my new roommate, Christy Turlington,\" she said. \"You dressed up in the '90s... Enjoy your clothes, enjoy your accessories, enjoy your hair.\"\n\nCampbell said her most fun look was from 2019 when she wore a sheer Valentino Couture gown with a feathered cape and lace stockings that came together just hours before.\n\nCher dazzles 1985 Met Gala\n\nCher, the woman who needs no last name, took the 1985 Met Gala theme, \"Costumes of Royal India,\" to the next level. She wore a sparkling gold and silver body suit with a large matching ear cuff.\n\nOther notable guests in attendance that year included Henry Kissinger, Raquel Welch and Barbara Walters.\n\nCher may have also been the first to wear a \"naked dress\" at the Met Gala when she made her debut in 1974. The dress had feathered sleeves and she wore her long, dark hair down loose.\n\nDiana Ross in feather gown, 1981 Met Gala\n\nThe Queen of Motown, Diana Ross, was photographed wearing a flowing, strapless feather gown at the 1981 Met Gala. That year's theme was \"The Eighteenth-Century Woman.\"\n\nRoss sported a similar feathered jacket for the 2014 American Music Awards, when she presented Taylor Swift with the first-ever Dick Clark Award of Excellence.\n\n\"I'm so blown away to just have received an award from Diana Ross,\" Swift said at the time.\n\nBianca Jagger's bodice dress, 1981 Met Gala\n\nBianca Jagger, a 1970s muse turned social activist, is seen here wearing a dark strapless dress with a full skirt and detailed embroidery at the 1981 Met Gala.\n\nHer classic Dior style inspired Kaia Gerber to recreate the look in 2021. Oscar de la Renta designed a similar gown, and Gerber wore her hair in waves parted to the side.\n\nGerber, who is the daughter of Cindy Crawford, described the dress in one word: \"elegant.\"\n\nJackie O, the original icon, 1979 Met Gala\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former U.S. first lady, was known for her fashion that shaped the nation. She first attended the Met Gala in 1979 (\"Fashions of the Habsburg Era: Austria-Hungary\") and later served as co-chair.\n\nIn 2001, the Met Gala theme paid tribute to the style icon with \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years.\"\n\n\"Jacqueline Kennedy is one of history's great style icons,\" Vogue's European editor-at-large Hamish Bowles said in a statement at the time. \"Her profound influence on the way an entire generation wanted to look, dress, and behave cannot be overestimated. She set the standards that American women strove to follow, and, on the world stage, provided a visual metaphor for the youth and promise of the Kennedy administration.\"\n\nThe Met Gala will be held Monday night in New York City.

The cost of attending the annual black-tie event, dubbed \"fashion's biggest night,\" is up sharply this year, with the price of an individual ticket soaring above the average down payment on a house.\n\nOfficially called The Costume Institute Benefit, the gathering of celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, design, sports and other industries supports the Metropolitan Museum of Art's acquisitions and exhibitions related to fashion. Attendees often wear outlandish attire in keeping with the event's theme.\n\nThe co-chairs of this year's benefit, held on May 6, are Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Wintour and Zendaya. It celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The dress code? \"The Garden of Time,\" according to The Met.\n\nThe exhibit's description provides some clues as to how to translate that into fashion. Hint: Pick styes that evoke nature. It features 250 garments spanning four centuries, which are \"visually united by iconography related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal,\" The Met notes.\n\nBut because the gala is a fundraiser, the price of admission doesn't come cheap, even if you're on the exclusive guest list.\n\nHow much are Met Gala tickets?\n\nFor invited individuals, the cost of entry to this year's gala is $75,000, The Met told CBS MoneyWatch. That's up 50% from last year's $50,000 price tag.\n\nA 10-person table starts at $350,000, according to The Met.\n\nHow much do celebrities have to pay to attend the Met Gala?\n\nWell, first they have to be invited. Not just anyone can buy a ticket or a table to the event.\n\nMeanwhile, many celebrities don't pay full freight. Instead, a design house typically springs for a table and invites guests they wish to host, one attendee confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch. So for some particularly glittering guests, attendance is free.\n\nWhere do the proceeds from Met Gala tickets go?\n\nAnna Wintour, who is Cond\u00e9 Nast's chief content officer, global editorial director at Vogue and a Met Trustee since 1999, controls the event's guest list. To date, under her leadership the event has raised more than $223.5 million for The Costume Institute, according to The Met.\n\nLast year's Met Gala raised raised nearly $22 million.

Ballard, and is in essence about the ephemeral nature of beauty.\n\nZendaya (L), shown here attending the 2019 Met Gala, is among the co-hosts for the 2024 event\n\nThe theme parallels the exhibit \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which focuses on the most fragile pieces of the Costume Institute's vast collection.\n\nThe show, which will be on view to the public from May 10 through September 2, features clothing so delicate it cannot be displayed on mannequins.\n\nCelebrity interpretation of the dress code is anyone's guess, but vintage couture will likely reign.\n\nZendaya's look is among the most highly anticipated: the 27-year-old has become a red carpet icon during her most recent movie press tours, with cyborg fits for \"Dune: Part Two\" and courtside chic for the tennis-themed \"Challengers.\"\n\nZendaya, shown here at the world premiere of the film \"Dune: Part Two\" in London, has started making movie press tours her own personal Met Galas\n\nShe hasn't attended a Met Gala since 2019, so her return is sure to turn heads.\n\nThe Costume Institute relies on the blockbuster Met Gala to fund its work, including exhibitions and acquisitions.\n\nThe gala was first held in 1948 and for decades was reserved for New York high society.\n\nWintour, the high priestess of fashion, took over the show in the 1990s, transforming the party into a catwalk for the rich and famous.\n\nThis year, a ticket costs a cool $75,000, with tables starting at $350,000.

A parade of A-Listers dress according to the theme inspired by the Costume Institute's latest exhibition (some more than others) and walk the steps up to the museum before disappearing inside to enjoy the galleries, dinner and drinks.\n\nThe Met Gala is taking place on Monday night and it's time to place your bets: Which showstopping archival piece will Zendaya wear? Who will pull off the most uncanny stunt, topping Jared Leto's \"twin\" or Doja Cat's feline prosthetics? Inside, which celebs will flout the no-photos rule to sneak bathroom selfies? How late will Rihanna show up?\n\nWhat is this year's theme and who are the co-chairs?\n\nThis year, the theme for the red carpet is \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing a 1962 short story of the same name by British author J.G. Ballard. Like the New Wave sci-fi story, which takes place in a garden of time-bending florals, the museum's exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" highlights connections between nature and technology, using AI, CGI and other tools to breathe new life into hundreds of fragile archival pieces spanning hundreds of years. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, curator-in-charge at the Costume Institute.\n\nBad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Zendaya will co-chair this year's Met Gala for the exhibition \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" James Devaney/GC Images/Getty Images; Victor Aubry/Sipa USA; Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images; Neil Mockford/Filmmagic/Getty Images\n\nExpect fantastical fashion with floral and sci-fi motifs on the red carpet, and stylists working with luxury houses to resurface famous older looks. The first celebrities to appear will be Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, the last of whom is making his Met Gala debut.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nA frenzy of A-List arrivals and photographs, the red carpet portion of the evening's proceedings last for a few hours, but that's the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and have a seated dinner. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has \"final say\" over every guest in attendance, the New York Times has previously reported.)\n\nInside the Met Gala, only professional photos are technically allowed. Anna Wintour tries to keep the event social-media free, and discourages phone use at the table. Arturo Holmes/MG23/Getty Images\n\nThough the red-carpet and afterparties get the most attention of the night, the gala is above all, a fundraiser, whose five-figure tickets raise millions of dollars for the museum each year -- setting a record at nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the recently-released book \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nWhat was last year's theme?\n\nThe conceptual theme is expected to be a change of pace from last year, when the dress code was set to honor the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019. Over the decades, tributes to the legacies of individual designers have included Rei Kawakubo, Charles James, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace, with the last two scheduled shortly after the designers' untimely deaths.\n\nLast year, guests paid tribute to the late Karl Lagerfeld by mimicking his personal style, wearing his designs and channeling his cat, Choupette. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo celebrate Lagerfeld, celebrities including Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman and Jenna Ortega flocked to the event in designs by Chanel, Fendi and Chlo\u00e9, where he left his indelible mark, but some paid a cheeky tribute to Lagerfeld's cat Choupette as well (hence Doja Cat's whiskered beauty look). Not all were pleased with the theme to honor the controversial designer, however, given his history of disparaging remarks about women's bodies and his refusal to champion more inclusive beauty standards.\n\nWhen did the Met Gala start?\n\nThe Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the nascent Costume Institute, organized by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet reportedly cost $50 each.\n\nOver the decades, the gala has transformed from an industry fete at off-site locations like Manhattan's Rainbow Room into an A-List phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the fashion world and New York society. Wintour, her successor, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, turning the gala into one of the most-watched events of the fashion calendar -- and the year. In 2023, the software company LaunchMetrics found that the Met Gala generated nearly double the \"media impact value\" for brands than the Super Bowl, at $995 million.\n\nWhat was the first Met Gala theme?\n\nThe first theme was \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, tied to a retrospective of the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga; the event was attended by guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nCher attended the \"Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design\" Met Gala in 1974. (Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images) Ron Galella/Getty Images\n\nEarly themes included \"Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,\" \"The Glory of Russian Costume,\" and \"The 18th-Century Woman.\" But gala-goers mostly kept to conventional eveningwear until the 2000s, when some guests began to have more fun with the themes -- and the internet allowed more eyes on the arrivals. The most memorable themes from the past decade have included \"China: Through the Looking Glass,\" \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and the divisive \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" thanks to celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners, who use the red carpet to put on a show.\n\nWho is banned from the Met Gala?\n\nEach year rumors fly about who may be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to any offense towards the event or Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor has only explicitly spoken about one guest she would \"never invite back\" in public -- Donald Trump, whom she mentioned on James Corden's late night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names.\n\nOther previous guests have sworn it off, however, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after she made an appearance at the event, Fey said on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that the gala is a \"jerk parade.\"\n\n\"If you had a million arms, all the people you would want to punch in the whole world -- they're all there,\" she said. \"I mean I was there, clearly I was one of them.\"\n\nSome celebrities backtrack, however. Gwyneth Paltrow famously called the Met Gala \"un-fun\" in 2013 and said she'd \"never\" go again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019).\n\nOlivia Wilde and Margaret Zhang doubled up on the same outfit in 2023. Kevin Mazur/MG23/Getty Images The pair joked about the faux pas on social media after. Kevin Mazur/MG23/Getty Images\n\nWhat shouldn't you do at the Met Gala?\n\nMet Gala guests have often broken the no-social-media rule to give a more candid glimpse of who is hanging with who and what goes on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson lit up cigarettes in the museum bathroom (to the ire of the museum's donors, reportedly).\n\nDespite what the Jason Derulo meme would have you believe, he -- nor anyone else -- has taken a tumble down the stairs. But some guests have famously rumbled -- this year marks ten years since the infamous after-party elevator fight between Jay-Z and Solange.\n\nA final faux pas? Wearing the same outfit, of course. While it's been reported that Wintour not only arranges the guest list but also has a hand in their fashion choices, last year, Olivia Wilde and departing \"Vogue China\" editor Margaret Zhang showed up in the same throwback Chlo\u00e9 violin dress in different color schemes. The pair took it in stride, sharing memes on social media about the accident. \"Great minds,\" Wilde wrote on Instagram. \"If you're gonna twin with anyone, make it @margaretzhang.\"", "source":

Attendees have to be invited, and tickets are $75,000 a person. It's a cash cow for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, raising $22 million last year.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and the dress code ... well, expect a lot of florals. The carpet officially starts at 5:30 p.m. Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth are your chairs.\n\nWe've got you covered with all the excitement as it happens.\n\nBy Brad Luck\n\nThe famed steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art are about to have all eyes of the world on them. So how can you watch the arrivals? \"New York Live\" will have a special edition from 6-7 p.m. on the NBC New York News streaming channel. Details here.\n\nIn a video tour led by digital creator Eric Sede\u00f1o, also known as @Ricotaquito on TikTok, the 5,000-square-foot suite is shown to come with a large living room, dining room, office, as well as five bedrooms, including a primary suite with an outside terrace.\n\nFashion's biggest night is full of stunning fits, but some designs have stirred controversy. NBC New York's Linda Gaudino takes a look back at some of the more questionable fashion choices.\n\nBy Mike Gavin\n\n\"We never go out of style.\" Here are the gowns Taylor Swift has worn at her six Met Gala appearances as speculation continues about her attendance at the 2024 event. Will she or won't she is the big question so many observers are watching.\n\nThe Met Gala captivates the eyes of the fashion world every single year -- but part of the awe of the night's festivities are not the big names walking the red carpet in outstanding outfits, but rather that that is all we see.\n\nThat's right -- the night is very hush-hush. Not much else aside from the fashionable entrances is made public, and apparently it is designed that way.\n\nOne of the main rules, that helps to keep the allure and mystery of the Met Gala alive is the fact that what happens inside is so secretive thanks to the no-phone rule -- and by extension no social media -- that all invitees must abide by, according to Vogue.com.\n\nHowever, like all rules, there are exceptions. Apparently, celebrities have gotten around the no-photos rule by ... sneaking them in while socializing in the bathrooms!\n\nThe Met Gala is known as \"fashion's biggest night\" -- and rightfully so!\n\nWhile many of us watch from the comfort of our own couches the countless celebrities walking the carpet for mere minutes of fashion splendor... those few minutes walking up the Metropolitan Museum of Art's steps is all that it takes for the stylish entrances and looks of the night to reach millions across the globe and become entrenched in fashion lore.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The reference is not to the fairy tale, though, but to treasured garments from the vast collection at the Costume Institute -- some too fragile to hang upright. Museum curators will place them in glass cases, like Sleeping Beauty herself.\n\nAnd with Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth as co-chairs of this year's star-studded event, draw-dropping fashion moments will surely take place.\n\nIn honor of the big event, we look back at the top 10 most iconic entrances and looks of Met Galas past.\n\nIt's an iconic night, where the Metropolitan Museum of Art becomes the spot to welcome worldwide stars and celebrities to the \"party of the year.\" The Met Gala has done that for more than 70 years.\n\nBut how did this tradition start and become the event for fashion and art lovers?\n\nThe Costume Institute Benefit, also known as The Met Gala, began in 1948 as a midnight supper that invited guests could attend for $50 a ticket, said the museum. Created by publicity doyenne Eleanor Lambert, who called the event the \"Party of the Year,\" it raised funds to support The Costume Institute and celebrated the opening of its major annual exhibition.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Lambert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eleanor Lambert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Beauty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fairy tale"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/MetGala_THUMB.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He carried a 26-foot cape with flower details and finished the look with pearl stud earrings.\n\nIt was designer Simone Porte Jacquemus' first time at the Met Gala and he told Vogue he knew who he wanted to bring as his guest.\n\n\"Bad Bunny is my favorite artist, it's a dream to dress him for my first Met Gala,\" Jacqumeus said in the interview. \"I was so inspired by him, he is the ultimate Jacquemus muse.\"\n\nMichaela Coel dripping in gold, 2023 Met Gala\n\nMichaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings.\n\nThe \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who told Vogue she \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\"\n\n\"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover of American Vogue,\" Coel said in a behind-the-scenes interview as she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\"\n\nHer fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.\n\nDoja Cat goes full cat, 2023 Met Gala\n\nLove it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.\n\nDoja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like.\n\nThe Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\"\n\nChoupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, has her own Instagram account with more than a quarter million followers.\n\nBlake Lively's NYC inspired gown, 2022 Met Gala\n\nBlake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier Versace gown for the 2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"\n\nLively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.\n\nHusband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.\n\nLively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece.\n\nHe started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.\n\nThe fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"\n\nThe artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.\n\nIman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala\n\nNobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best.\n\nHer outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.\n\nReed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"\n\nIman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie.\n\nMaluma's red leather suit, 2021 Met Gala\n\nMaluma was the first reggaet\u00f3n artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope.\n\nHe joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.\n\n\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"\n\nHe also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.\n\nZendaya's light-up Cinderella look, 2019 Met Gala\n\nZendaya joins Bad Bunny as this year's co-chairs, and the fairy princess is quickly becoming a queen of the Met Gala. First there was Joan of Arc in 2018, then her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"\n\nWith the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.\n\nRoach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.\n\nAs for this year's look, he says Zendaya's dress won't even be fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview published Thursday. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"\n\nThe Kardashians walked The Met steps together for the 2019 Met Gala and posed for an epic family photo.\n\nKim Kardashian donned a skin-tight corset dress from Thierry Mugler that looked as though she had just emerged from water. She was accompanied by her then-husband Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.\n\nHer sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott.\n\nAnd of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that was reportedly a last-minute suggestion from Kylie.\n\nThe Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021.\n\nBilly Porter goes for gold, 2019 Met Gala\n\nOh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages.\n\nPorter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, he told Vogue that \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\"\n\nPorter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look.\n\n\"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said.\n\nLady Gaga's many looks, 2019 Met Gala\n\nBefore Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme.\n\nLady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath.\n\nThen she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots.\n\nThe whole theatrical performance lasted about 15 minutes and sent the crowd into a frenzy.\n\nCardi B's giant feathered gown, 2019 Met Gala\n\nCardi B made a bold statement in head-to-toe ruby red at the 2019 Met Gala. Her feathered gown featured a hood, giant train and reportedly 44 carats worth of rubies on the bodice.\n\nDesigner Thom Browne told Vogue he created this dress for her because she \"has the ultimate beauty in a woman's body.\"\n\nThe Bronx rapper was also covered in jewels at the 2018 Met Gala, when she was several months pregnant with her first child, daughter Kulture.\n\n\"Wifey is the truth, she just killed the Met Gala,\" her then-husband, Migos rapper OFFSET, posted on social media after the 2019 gala.\n\nJared Leto holds his head, Met Gala 2019\n\nJared Leto has been known for his extreme costumes, and the 2019 Met Gala was no different. He turned heads with a lifelike prop that looked much like his own head.\n\nAccording to Vogue, Leto took a page from Gucci's Fall 2018 runway show when model Unia Pakhomova carried a replica of her head as a clutch. His red gown and crystal harness were designed by Alessandro Michele for the fashion house.\n\nLeto outdid himself in 2023 when he showed up in a fluffy, full-body cat suit.\n\nSadly for his fans, he is reportedly sitting out the 2024 Met Gala because his band, \"30 Seconds to Mars,\" is touring in Europe.\n\nKaty Perry's heavenly wings, 2018 Met Gala\n\n\"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" was the Met Gala theme in 2018, and Katy Perry soared in a giant set of angel wings from Versace.\n\nShe rocked a platinum blonde pixie cut with a gold mini dress and thigh-high boots. On top of that sat her huge wings that stretched from the floor to well above her head.\n\nThe singer pulled up in a vintage convertible before posing with the wings on The Met steps.\n\nThen, who could forget her outfit the following year, when she wore a crystal chandelier on her head and then dressed in a burger suit for the afterparty.\n\nFrances McDormand has fun with a headpiece, 2018 Met Gala\n\nFrances McDormand had the most fun with a whimsical headpiece from Valentino at the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nThe Oscar winner was photographed striking her best movie-star-pose as the massive headpiece nearly covered her whole face.\n\nShe was later seen in a social media video rocking out to the song \"Where's Your Head At\" inside the museum.\n\nTwo years later, McDormand appeared on the cover of Vogue, telling the publication, \"to still be culturally relevant as a 63-year-old female is so deeply, deeply gratifying.\"\n\nThe giant yellow gown was designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei for that year's theme, \"China: Through the Looking Glass.\" Her dramatic train seems to have ushered in era of these dresses and their grand entrances.\n\nRihanna had back-to-back hits for the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: The Art of the In-Between\" theme in 2017 and for \"Heavenly Bodies\" in 2018.\n\nThen, of course, in 2021, she walked the red carpet with her partner, A$AP Rocky, while pregnant with their first child, RZA, and again in 2023 while expecting their second son, Riot Rose.\n\nBeyonce's nearly-there naked dress, 2015 Met Gala\n\nThe naked dress isn't exactly new, but jaws dropped when Beyonc\u00e9 walked in wearing this to the 2015 Met Gala.\n\nThe floor-length dress from Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci featured strategically placed jewels but was otherwise see-through.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's stylist Ty Hunter says her 2015 gown was the heaviest one to wear.\n\n\"A lot of the rhinestones and gems, the rocky crystals, they were very heavy,\" he told Women's Wear Daily. \"It looked like the lightest ones because she looked naked under it, but it was one of the heaviest.\"\n\nSolange Knowles' fan dress, 2015 Met Gala\n\nQueen Bey's younger sister also made the list for the 2015 Met Gala with a head-scratching mini dress.\n\nSolange Knowles sported a futuristic design from Giles. While she told Refinery29 the dress \"gave the illusion of the fan,\" others compared it to an oyster, a sting ray or a computer background.\n\nSolange is known for taking fashion risks, and in 2018 she made headlines for asking her followers to vote for her outfit.\n\nAndre Leon Talley, a red carpet staple, 2015 Met Gala\n\nAndre Leon Tally was a fixture at the Met Gala since 1974 and he hosted its red carpet correspondence until 2018. The former Vogue creative director died of a heart attack in 2022 at the age of 73.\n\nHe is seen here leaving The Mark Hotel as he prepares to host the 2015 Met Gala. That year, he praised Rihanna's gown as \"indulgent\" and \"luxurious,\" calling her the \"queen of the night.\"\n\nTalley's fashion career began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute where he took an unpaid apprenticeship under Diana Vreeland. Those who knew him said he didn't merely study fashion, he was obsessed with it since his childhood. He went on to work for Women's Wear Daily and Vogue, ultimately becoming the first Black man to be named creative director.\n\nKate Moss in metallic, 2009 Met Gala\n\nSupermodel Kate Moss was the darling of the 2009 Met Gala in a metallic mini dress and matching headwrap from Marc Jacobs. That year's theme was \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion,\" and she couldn't have been more right for the part.\n\nMoss and Jacobs have worked on runways and campaigns together since the 1990s, dating back to his controversial grunge collection.\n\nMoss also gets points for her 1995 Met Gala look, when she wore a pale yellow Calvin Klein slip dress with a plunging back.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker with Alexander McQueen, 2006 Met Gala\n\nIt goes without saying, but Sarah Jessica Parker is always one to watch at the Met Gala. Her career has seen countless head-turning looks, from a thrifted dress for her first Met Gala in 1995 to her oversized mohawk for the 2013 theme \"Punk: Chaos to Couture.\"\n\nOne look that stands out is her outfit for the 2006 Met Gala theme \"Anglomania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion.\" She walked in with Alexander McQueen wearing a short dress while he wore a jacket, tie and kilt, and they both had coordinating plaid sashes.\n\nParker later told Vogue she was nervous because she deeply admired the late designer and even kept scraps of fabric he used from their dress fittings.\n\nLiv Tyler & Stella McCartney \"rock royalty,\" 1999 Met Gala\n\nThe 1999 Met Gala theme was \"Rock Style,\" so who better to make a splash than Liv Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, and Stella McCartney, daughter of The Beatles' Paul McCartney?\n\nThe duo attended the gala together in matching shirts with the words, \"Rock Royalty\" scrawled on them. McCartney told Vogue she took a pack of Haynes shirts to a vintage shop in Little Italy, where she helped customize the final design.\n\n\"I didn't come at it intentionally to be rebellious at all. I didn't know what people wore,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't really appropriate that we wore those shirts. Officially, we weren't following the honors of the dress code. It was very cool and rebellious of Stella,\" Tyler added.\n\nPrincess Diana's silk slip, 1996 Met Gala\n\nFrom rock to royals, Princess Diana's appearance at the 1996 Met Gala goes down in history as one of the most memorable moments. The theme that year was \"Christian Dior.\"\n\nPrincess Diana made a statement in a blue floor-length silk slip dress from John Galliano for Dior and a pearl choker. Vogue described it as her \"most un-royal look to date,\" and said it signaled her freedom after her divorce and departure from the royal family.\n\nDozens of other royals have attended the gala over the years, including the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece who made multiple appearances in 1989, 1995 and 2001.\n\nGianni & Donatella Versace in leather and gold, 1996 Met Gala\n\nVersace's designs have come up several times on this list, and the siblings behind the brand are on here for their leather and gold look at the 1996 Met Gala. That year's theme was Christian Dior.\n\nGianni Versace was the theme the following year, months after he was murdered outside his Miami Beach home.\n\nHis sister, Donatella Versace, took over the fashion house and has been a staple of the Met Gala since the 1990s. She dressed some of the biggest stars, and early photos show her arriving with Naomi Campbell in 1995 and posing for a photo with Madonna and Cher in 1997.\n\nNaomi Campbell's sparkle dress, 1995 Met Gala\n\nSpeaking of Naomi Campbell, she made quite the entrance in this shimmering, floor-length gown at the Met Gala in 1995, themed \"Haute Couture.\"\n\n\"I loved this dress. It was slim-fitting and body-hugging, and just glistened,\" she told Vogue in a 2020 interview. \"I remember when I saw this dress for the first time, I thought, wow, Gianni, is that for me? It seemed like one of those dresses that you read in those fairytale books.\"\n\nCampbell made her Met Gala debut in 1990 wearing a multi-colored mini dress also from Gianni Versace.\n\n\"I was in such awe to first be invited by Gianni Versace through my new roommate, Christy Turlington,\" she said. \"You dressed up in the '90s... Enjoy your clothes, enjoy your accessories, enjoy your hair.\"\n\nCampbell said her most fun look was from 2019 when she wore a sheer Valentino Couture gown with a feathered cape and lace stockings that came together just hours before.\n\nCher dazzles 1985 Met Gala\n\nCher, the woman who needs no last name, took the 1985 Met Gala theme, \"Costumes of Royal India,\" to the next level. She wore a sparkling gold and silver body suit with a large matching ear cuff.\n\nOther notable guests in attendance that year included Henry Kissinger, Raquel Welch and Barbara Walters.\n\nCher may have also been the first to wear a \"naked dress\" at the Met Gala when she made her debut in 1974. The dress had feathered sleeves and she wore her long, dark hair down loose.\n\nDiana Ross in feather gown, 1981 Met Gala\n\nThe Queen of Motown, Diana Ross, was photographed wearing a flowing, strapless feather gown at the 1981 Met Gala. That year's theme was \"The Eighteenth-Century Woman.\"\n\nRoss sported a similar feathered jacket for the 2014 American Music Awards, when she presented Taylor Swift with the first-ever Dick Clark Award of Excellence.\n\n\"I'm so blown away to just have received an award from Diana Ross,\" Swift said at the time.\n\nBianca Jagger's bodice dress, 1981 Met Gala\n\nBianca Jagger, a 1970s muse turned social activist, is seen here wearing a dark strapless dress with a full skirt and detailed embroidery at the 1981 Met Gala.\n\nHer classic Dior style inspired Kaia Gerber to recreate the look in 2021. Oscar de la Renta designed a similar gown, and Gerber wore her hair in waves parted to the side.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former U.S. first lady, was known for her fashion that shaped the nation. She first attended the Met Gala in 1979 (\"Fashions of the Habsburg Era: Austria-Hungary\") and later served as co-chair.\n\nIn 2001, the Met Gala theme paid tribute to the style icon with \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years.\"\n\n\"Jacqueline Kennedy is one of history's great style icons,\" Vogue's European editor-at-large Hamish Bowles said in a statement at the time. \"Her profound influence on the way an entire generation wanted to look, dress, and behave cannot be overestimated. She set the standards that American women strove to follow, and, on the world stage, provided a visual metaphor for the youth and promise of the Kennedy administration.\"\n\nUkrainian who fled war to

A-list artists, actors, models, and designers gather to celebrate the artistry, craftsmanship, history, and future of fashion. After a one-of-a-kind red carpet, attendees enjoy a dinner and the Costume Institute's new exhibition before it opens to the public.\n\nAs governor of the gala, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour organizes every detail from the exclusive guest list to the seating chart. She chose the dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" based on a short story by JG Ballard.\n\nIn the 1962 story of the same name, freshly plucked time-reversing crystal flowers protect paradise from invasion until there are none left. The story highlights the connections between nature's fragile beauty and inevitable innovation, which the new installation echoes.\n\nThe theme of the night and new exhibition is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. Don't let the name fool you into thinking it's just about fairytales.\n\nThe theme \"has not to do with the Brothers Grimm or Disney, but rather the celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile that it can't ever be worn again -- and are thus sleeping beauties in the scrupulous archives of the Costume Institute,\" according to Vogue.\n\nExpect to see a mix of iconic looks from history books and fashion archives refreshed with the latest tech. Think Zendaya's 2019 Cinderella dress that lit up and transformed with the flick of Law Roach's magic wand. The chic sci-fi sky is the limit for what could be \"one of the best Met Gala red carpets we've ever seen,\" PEOPLE reports.\n\n\"This exhibition is all about breathing new life into archival fashion, which sets the stage for a bold red carpet. There will be a number of looks on display in the exhibition that have rarely been seen in public before; some of which are too fragile to ever be worn again. For me, the theme calls for jaw-dropping, one-of-a-kind creations that push the envelope of red carpet dressing,\" fashion critic Nicky Campbell said.\n\nAs 2024 Met Gala co-chairs, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny should set the tone. All three turn heads and make headlines when they hit the red carpet and tonight should be no different.\n\nLa La Anthony will return as Vogue's red carpet live-stream host with Emma Chamberlain.\n\nMet Gala newcomers Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri received invitations after their whirlwind awards season, per Page Six.\n\nRihanna already Rih-vealed that she's keeping things \"chill\" for her Met Gala look. The new mom of two \"don't got time for a lot of s**t,\" for this year's red carpet. She and fellow \"Fashion Killa\" A$AP Rocky might still shut it down like they did in 2023.\n\nFans can keep their fingers crossed to see these best-dressed celebs who attended the Met Gala in previous years.\n\nBOSSIP will keep you posted on the Met Gala red carpet arrivals, hottest looks, and viral moments from the night.

Fashion's biggest night has a tendency of producing the kind of fierce looks that will dominate glossies and Instagram feeds for the foreseeable. And you can watch every moment with Met Gala live streams.\n\nWith the \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition currently being held in the MMA's Anna Wintour Costume Center, it was an obvious choice for this year's theme. Guests are being asked to adhere to the rather cryptic 'The Garden of Time' dress code, meaning that they can let their imaginations run wild.\n\nAs ever, the guest list will be a who's who of film, TV, music, fashion and sport. The co-chairs of the 2024 Met Gala are Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth, Bad Bunny and Anna Wintour -- not a bad start!\n\nAnd with the hottest ticket in town costing a reported $75,000, it's no wonder that the word 'exclusive' is so synonymous with this event.\n\nDoja Cat stole the show last year, dressing as... well, a cat. So it will be fascinating to see who will stand out the most this year, following in the unforgettable footsteps of Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, Grimes and Cardi B.\n\nHere's everything you need to watch the 2024 Met Gala online and for free.\n\nIconic fashion magazine Vogue is showing the 2024 Met Gala absolutely free, with all the action from the red carpet as it happens.\n\nIn addition to going out on the Vogue website, it will also be streamed on the brand's YouTube channel and TikTok account.\n\nVogue's coverage is being hosted by actress Gwendoline Christie, actor La La Anthony, model Ashley Graham and YouTube star Emma Chamberlain.\n\nMet Gala 2024 live streams start at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT / 11 p.m. BST / 8 a.m. AEST (Tue).\n\nIf you're somewhere that blocks access to the 2024 Met Gala streams, you might need a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to access them. The software allows your devices to appear to be in an entirely different location. Our favorite is NordVPN -- it's the best on the market:\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala is airing from 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT on E! (in addition to E! Online and the likes of Peacock and NBC News).\n\nE! is available on a wide variety of cable plans. Or if you've already cut the cord and still want to watch on TV, you can watch E! on a live TV service like Sling TV, Fubo, YouTube TV, Hulu With Live TV or DirecTV Stream.\n\nOf these options, we recommend Sling TV and Fubo, two of our favorite cable TV alternatives.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Met Gala, a pinnacle event in the fashion world, is all set to take over the internet. The Met Gala, often hailed as 'Fashion's Biggest Night', will uphold its tradition by returning on the first Monday of May. This year's theme is 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion'. Unlike previous themes, this year's focus will be on reviving unique garments from various centuries, offering a novel perspective to fashion enthusiasts.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will be held on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In India however, it will fall on May 7. The official time for the event is 2:30 pm. However, it will be around 5:30 p.m. ET and 3:00 a.m. in India.\n\nWhile much of the red carpet action will be across social media, the elite event which is invite-based only and has maintained its exclusivity over the years will livestream on DirecTV, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, and Sling in the US. Meanwhile, it will not be broadcast in India but those who wish to watch it can do so via social media platforms and YouTube.\n\nAbout the Met Gala 2024\n\nBehind the scenes, meticulous planning begins immediately after the previous gala, with approximately 100 people working year-round to orchestrate the event. From the seating chart, meticulously crafted to foster networking opportunities, to the menu selection, personally curated by Anna Wintour, no detail is left to chance.\n\nWhile the gala will celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,' the official dress theme is 'The Garden of Time.'\n\nThis year's exhibition will feature significant pieces spanning over 400 years of fashion history, showcasing iconic designers such as Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, and Hubert de Givenchy.\n\nZendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny will serve as the night's co-chairs. The theme aims to celebrate delicate pieces of fashion that are often deemed too fragile for wear, affectionately termed the 'sleeping beauties'.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yves Saint Laurent (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_de_Givenchy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert de Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/rihannawatchmet_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 653}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 740, "textEnd": 745}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

When she was initially asked about her look for the occasion, Lopez wouldn't share too many details.\n\n\"I can't tell you anything about it, you'll have to tune it to see,\" she said. \"It's exciting, it's a fun night for sure for fashion.\"\n\nHowever, the singer did acknowledge that her outfit wasn't easy to move around in. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight, she said: \"Barely, ever.\"\n\nLopez then expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that, quipping: \"The Met Gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\nEarlier in the interview, the Atlas star described how she's looking forward to co-hosting the 2024 Met Gala with her fellow co-chairs: Zendaya, Bad Bunny, and actor Chris Hemsworth.\n\n\"I was really honoured to be asked to host it,\" Lopez said. \"Anna was gracious enough to ask me. And we're going to have a good time. It's always a nice time there. It's such an interesting mix of artists and business people. It's not just music or film, you know, it's everybody. And you get to have some really interesting interactions.\"\n\nAlthough we don't yet know what Lopez will be struggling to walk in tonight, the Met Gala always comes with its own dress code. For this year's event, attendees must follow a dress code loosely labelled, \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nIn line with the forthcoming exhibit -- which is centred around 50 historically significant pieces, some of which are far too fragile ever to be worn again -- the dress code takes inspiration from a short story of the same title, written by JG Ballard in 1962.\n\nAnd therefore Met Gala guests must follow a dress code that resembles fleeting beauty. Of course, attendees can embrace the obvious by wearing florals -- or even real life flowers -- to represent an actual garden. For this option, Vogue recommended looking at the \"Sleeping Beauties\" exhibition itself, which has a black evening coat by Charles Frederick Worth from 1889 on display.\n\nThe annual fashion event, which takes place on the first Monday in May, will coincide with the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute exhibit, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period.\n\nLast week, Zendaya's stylist - Law Roach - also opened up about her highly-anticipated look for the 2024 Met Gala. In a new interview with The New York Times published on 2 May, the fashion icon revealed that he didn't spend that much time preparing the actor's look for the star-studded occasion.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_raiken@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Amber Raiken", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Roach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frederick_Worth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Frederick Worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

These days, the entry price for one ticket has skyrocketed up to $75,000 in 2024, marking a colossal increase from 2023's fee of $50,000.\n\nThis year's dress code theme is the elusive 'The Garden of Time,' tied to the institute's forthcoming spring exhibition, entitled 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.'\n\nIn the past, the likes of Kim Kardashian, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Naomi Campbell have all graced the Met's glitzy red carpet, as well as LGBTQ+ fan favourites Lil Nas X, Troye Sivan, Kim Petras and Hunter Schafer.\n\nThough this year's details are relatively few and far between, Vogue's editor Anna Wintour named the four co-chairs for this year's event as being Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya.\n\nAnd, as with most red carpet events, there's an LGBTQ+ fanbase at the helm of the Met Gala. There's the unlimited chance for fresh pop culture, meme-worthy moments (as in 2019, when various celebrities completely butchered the 'camp' theme and chose to wear black), as well as the hidden messages behind various fashion choices.\n\nNotably, for his first Met Gala attendance after coming out as trans in 2020, Elliot Page wore a suit with a brooch that was interpreted as paying homage to queer history, while Cara Delevingne previously wore a military-style vest adorned with the words 'peg the patriarchy.'\n\nRobyn Electra, founder and director of transgender lingerie and swimwear brand Gaff and Go, follows the Met Gala each and every year, dissecting the ultra-glam celebrity looks.\n\n'The Met Gala is regarded as the world's most prestigious and glamourous fashion event, bringing together the biggest names in show business,' 27-year-old Robyn, who is based between London and Liverpool, tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n'I am a big fan of the Met Gala and I follow it every year. Every year's theme and fashion is different, with lots of celebrities on the red carpet showcasing glamorous and fabulous couture pieces.'\n\nAs a transgender woman, the Met Gala holds a special place in Robyn's heart - and reminds her of some of the show-stopping looks showcased on the runway of cult TV show, RuPaul's Drag Race - a dynasty followed by countless LGBTQ+ fans.\n\nMore broadly, fashion is hugely important to Robyn, and she has a huge room full of unique pieces with shoes and bags to match.\n\n'The right clothes can make a difference, and the right clothes help save lives,' she says. 'Wearing tucking underwear that will tuck you properly when you are wearing a bodycon dress while in public will keep you safe and keep you out of harm's way, especially from people who are constantly attacking us trans women.'\n\n'Our community is a very diverse, colourful, proud and vibrant one. We love the drama and eccentric fashion showcased on the red carpet. We love the outgoing bold pieces and statement pieces worn by celebrities on the Met Gala red carpet, as it reminds us of how beautiful, bold and strong we are,' she adds.\n\n'We love to express ourselves; we take care of our fashion and what we wear, and we do this with particular designs; we search what we wear with great care. And that is why the Met Gala is like an inspiration to us and it's the talk of the town, as it showcases to us fabulous and dramatic designs that greatly inspire us.'\n\nEach year, together with her trans sisters, Robyn hosts a party in which they dissect the various looks on the runway.\n\n'We host our Trans Fashion Tea Party, where we sit together and spill the tea on the red carpet looks being worn by celebrities,' she shares.\n\n'We take our time to analyse each individual piece and also scrutinise every aspect of these dresses by positively adding/suggesting alternatives as in how it could be styled differently, etc. We also talk about how we could improve certain fashion dresses on the red carpet so as to give the wearer that glamorous, chic look.'\n\nLikewise, superfans 42-year-old John Bruce and 46-year-old Paulo Ribeiro also watch the Met Gala each year, describing it as one of the 'greatest moments of the year in fashion.'\n\nThe founders of PRM model agency, one of the most diverse modelling agencies in the world, John and Paulo represent an array of LGBTQ+ models, refugees and over 40s.\n\n'Paulo is always excited to see all the super models - especially Giselle Buchanan - and exactly what they're wearing. He guesses which designer has dressed them and describes the event as \"Anna Wintour's day of the year\",' John tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n'She [Wintour] is a such powerful figure in our industry... what she represents and has done to our world at the helm of Vogue,' he adds.\n\n'Guessing together beforehand what look celebs might go for on the night, or which designer they've chosen to work with, is also something we like to do. We love seeing new designers who end up making it really big at the following year's fashion week. It can put a new designer on the map and for us that's super exciting.'\n\nAnd, like Robyn, the pair have historically hosted parties to celebrate the Met Gala, sharing their takes on the red carpet looks with friends.\n\n'A few years ago, we hosted a viewing party. Staying awake until 1am on a Monday night wasn't a big deal,' Paulo adds.\n\n'It's even more fun having some champagne, and also helps to give us inspiration for fashion weeks, with some of the models judging and discussing the looks of everyone with a bunch of friends while dressing up.'\n\nAll in all, John and Paulo believe that the Met Gala means so much to the LGBTQ+ community because it's characterised by 'glamour, drama, beauty and magic' - a truly unique and fun combination.\n\n'The Met Gala for us is an incredible combination of both the LGBTQ+ community and the fashion industry, which we are part of,' Paulo reflects.\n\n'Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga [who have all graced the Met Gala carpet in the past] are massive icons for the LGBTQ+ community, so to see all of those incredible individuals on one night, in one place, all sharing the love for the entertainment industry in all its glitz and glamour is such a treat and highlight for us and a lot of our friends.'\n\nMORE : I Kissed A Girl conversation about the word 'lesbian' is leaving people in tears\n\nMORE : Hollywood icon reveals most 'nerve-wracking' part of the Met Gala", "source": {"uri":

A parade of A-Listers dress according to the theme inspired by the Costume Institute's latest exhibition (some more than others) and walk the steps up to the museum before disappearing inside to enjoy the galleries, dinner and drinks.\n\nThe Met Gala is taking place on Monday night and it's time to place your bets: Which showstopping archival piece will Zendaya wear? Who will pull off the most uncanny stunt, topping Jared Leto's \"twin\" or Doja Cat's feline prosthetics? Inside, which celebs will flout the no-photos rule to sneak bathroom selfies? How late will Rihanna show up?\n\nWhat is this year's theme and who are the co-chairs?\n\nThis year, the theme for the red carpet is \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing a 1962 short story of the same name by British author J.G. Ballard. Like the New Wave sci-fi story, which takes place in a garden of time-bending florals, the museum's exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" highlights connections between nature and technology, using AI, CGI and other tools to breathe new life into hundreds of fragile archival pieces spanning hundreds of years. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, curator-in-charge at the Costume Institute.\n\nExpect fantastical fashion with floral and sci-fi motifs on the red carpet, and stylists working with luxury houses to resurface famous older looks. The first celebrities to appear will be Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, the last of whom is making his Met Gala debut.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nA frenzy of A-List arrivals and photographs, the red carpet portion of the evening's proceedings last for a few hours, but that's the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and have a seated dinner. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has \"final say\" over every guest in attendance, the New York Times has previously reported.)\n\nInside the Met Gala, only professional photos are technically allowed. Anna Wintour tries to keep the event social-media free, and discourages phone use at the table.\n\nThough the red-carpet and afterparties get the most attention of the night, the gala is above all, a fundraiser, whose five-figure tickets raise millions of dollars for the museum each year -- setting a record at nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the recently-released book \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nWhat was last year's theme?\n\nThe conceptual theme is expected to be a change of pace from last year, when the dress code was set to honor the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019. Over the decades, tributes to the legacies of individual designers have included Rei Kawakubo, Charles James, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace, with the last two scheduled shortly after the designers' untimely deaths.\n\nLast year, guests paid tribute to the late Karl Lagerfeld by mimicking his personal style, wearing his designs and channeling his cat, Choupette. (Angela Weiss / AFP / Getty Images via CNN Newsource)\n\nTo celebrate Lagerfeld, celebrities including Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman and Jenna Ortega flocked to the event in designs by Chanel, Fendi and Chlo\u00e9, where he left his indelible mark, but some paid a cheeky tribute to Lagerfeld's cat Choupette as well (hence Doja Cat's whiskered beauty look). Not all were pleased with the theme to honor the controversial designer, however, given his history of disparaging remarks about women's bodies and his refusal to champion more inclusive beauty standards.\n\nWhen did the Met Gala start?\n\nThe Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the nascent Costume Institute, organized by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet reportedly cost US$50 each.\n\nOver the decades, the gala has transformed from an industry fete at off-site locations like Manhattan's Rainbow Room into an A-List phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the fashion world and New York society. Wintour, her successor, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, turning the gala into one of the most-watched events of the fashion calendar -- and the year. In 2023, the software company LaunchMetrics found that the Met Gala generated nearly double the \"media impact value\" for brands than the Super Bowl, at US$995 million.\n\nWhat was the first Met Gala theme?\n\nThe first theme was \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, tied to a retrospective of the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga; the event was attended by guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nEarly themes included \"Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,\" \"The Glory of Russian Costume,\" and \"The 18th-Century Woman.\" But gala-goers mostly kept to conventional eveningwear until the 2000s, when some guests began to have more fun with the themes -- and the internet allowed more eyes on the arrivals. The most memorable themes from the past decade have included \"China: Through the Looking Glass,\" \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and the divisive \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" thanks to celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners, who use the red carpet to put on a show.\n\nWho is banned from the Met Gala?\n\nEach year rumors fly about who may be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to any offense towards the event or Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor has only explicitly spoken about one guest she would \"never invite back\" in public -- Donald Trump, whom she mentioned on James Corden's late night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names.\n\nOther previous guests have sworn it off, however, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after she made an appearance at the event, Fey said on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that the gala is a \"jerk parade.\"\n\n\"If you had a million arms, all the people you would want to punch in the whole world -- they're all there,\" she said. \"I mean I was there, clearly I was one of them.\"\n\nSome celebrities backtrack, however. Gwyneth Paltrow famously called the Met Gala \"un-fun\" in 2013 and said she'd \"never\" go again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019).\n\nWhat shouldn't you do at the Met Gala?\n\nMet Gala guests have often broken the no-social-media rule to give a more candid glimpse of who is hanging with who and what goes on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson lit up cigarettes in the museum bathroom (to the ire of the museum's donors, reportedly).\n\nDespite what the Jason Derulo meme would have you believe, he -- nor anyone else -- has taken a tumble down the stairs. But some guests have famously rumbled -- this year marks ten years since the infamous after-party elevator fight between Jay-Z and Solange.\n\nA final faux pas? Wearing the same outfit, of course. While it's been reported that Wintour not only arranges the guest list but also has a hand in their fashion choices, last year, Olivia Wilde and departing \"Vogue China\" editor Margaret Zhang showed up in the same throwback Chlo\u00e9 violin dress in different color schemes. The pair took it in stride, sharing memes on social media about the accident. \"Great minds,\" Wilde wrote on Instagram. \"If you're gonna twin with anyone, make it @margaretzhang.\"", "source":

The fashion event of the year, held every May at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is attended by only the glitziest A-list celebrities and biggest names in fashion. The red carpet photos are legendary, the yearly themes are always highly anticipated, and getting a ticket makes the Taylor Swift Ticketmaster debacle look like a cake walk. Presiding over the entire affair is Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who plans the event down to the tiniest detail and has singlehandedly turned the Met Gala into the media maelstrom that it is today.\n\nHow much does a ticket to the Met Gala cost?\n\nAccording to the BBC, inflation has really come for the Met Gala as the price for a ticket in 2024 is $75,000, which is up from the 2023 price of just $50,000 per person (what a steal!) But, just because you've got $75K lying around somewhere does not guarantee you a ticket. In fact, in nearly every case, having the money doesn't really matter at all.\n\nRelated: All the Best Looks from the 2022 Met Gala\n\nAnd how do you get a ticket to the Met Gala?\n\nThere are several ways to even earn the ABILITY to purchase a ticket to the event. The first is by being a mega donor to the Met Museum, and the second is by being a reputable fashion house or massive corporation that secures a table. Both of these are completely subject to Wintour's discretion though, so just because you've donated $1 million to the Museum or own Frito-Lay does not mean you'll get an invite.\n\nHow much does a table cost at the Met Gala?\n\nWhile some people get individual invites, most tables are bought for $350,000 by companies like Gucci, Prada or Amazon, who then get to choose which celebs they would like to sit at their table/wear their designs. However, even those selections are subject to Anna Wintour's approval, so if Jeff Bezos wants to bring his aunt as a guest, that might get nixed.\n\nTL;DR the Met Gala tickets are $75,000, but you can't get one anyways so it doesn't really matter. You're better off just following Parade's coverage instead.\n\nNext, Everything You Need to Know About the 2024 Met Gala", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_huff@postandcourier.com", "name": "Matthew Huff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Editor-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whirlpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parade (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frito-Lay", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frito-Lay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/07/c07c2bfb-6925-540f-83f2-e1733842ecc7/6639387087a03.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They'll enter the museum for a high-profile celebration of fashion -- sponsored by TikTok this year -- that remains entirely out of sight of the public's gaze, so that all we see will be the arrival of the beautiful and wealthy. This is the Met Gala, and for an event that is theoretically just for fashion nerds and doesn't even get televised inside, it has a remarkable cultural cachet.\n\nThe Gala, which falls on the first Monday of May, purportedly celebrates the Anna Wintour Costume Center's keystone exhibit every year. It's overseen by the Center's eponymous queen: Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. This year, the exhibit is called \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and features some of the museum's oldest and most fragile garments. Guests have accordingly been asked to follow the dress code \"Garden of Time,\" after a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard, with moody florals, clock motifs, and even outstanding archival pieces all expected to fit the theme.\n\nWintour notoriously guards the guest list, but Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth are all celebrity co-chairs of the party. This year, exploding protests over the war in Gaza and a possible strike by Cond\u00e9 Nast workers also threatens to cast a shadow on the rarefied gathering.\n\nWhen the Met Gala was first instituted in 1948, it would not have boasted such an A-list roster of hosts, nor such a trendy corporate sponsor (albeit one currently in crisis). The Gala has always been glamorous, but it used to be a local event, primarily a showcase for the society ladies of the Upper East Side. It took decades of careful strategizing and alliance-building with Hollywood to make the Met Gala the pop cultural phenomenon it is today.\n\nNow, the Met Gala shines because it is an unparalleled occasion for celebrity image-building. It is a showcase for both the illusion of accessibility and unreachable glamour at the heart of modern celebrity.\n\nHere's how it got there.\n\nThe Met's Costume Institute was born out of the Museum of Costume Art, a library devoted to the art of theatrical costumes. In 1946, Lord & Taylor president Dorothy Shaver decided to bring the collection to the Met. Fashion, she felt, needed the cultural power that comes from allying with a major museum. It needed its history preserved and its present recognized to be respected as a major and vital art form. The Met agreed to take the collection -- with the caveat that the American fashion industry would be responsible for raising the funds for the Costume Institute's entire annual operating budget. The Met Gala was conceived out of this grim necessity.\n\nAt the time, the party was planned by publicist Eleanor Lambert, and it didn't even take place at the Met. It was a midnight breakfast hosted at Manhattan institutions like the Waldorf Astoria, Central Park, and the Rainbow Room. It was a glamorous affair, but it was for local society and fashion insiders only.\n\nIn 1974, Diana Vreeland arrived at the Met as special consultant for the Costume Institute from Vogue. There, she had been editor-in-chief and was fired, according to rumor, for refusing to mind her budget. Rumor also had it that New York society royalty Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Babe Paley campaigned for her to take the new post.\n\nVreeland brought with her a new edge. She introduced the concept of linking the gala to an Institute exhibit via a theme, the first one being \"The World of Balenciaga.\" Her parties were lavish and romantic. \"There was evocative music and sometimes even fragrance was pumped into the air,\" so that \"regardless of the fashions being presented, it always felt like a delicious opium den,\" recalled designer Steven Stolman in Town and Country in 2018.\n\nThe opium was sometimes close to literal. New York magazine reported in 2005 that Vreeland liked to use a signature perfume in the galleries for each party, and for a 1980 exhibit on China, Vreeland scented the air with the YSL eau de toilette Opium. When guests complained, she explained that the fragrance was needed to create the appropriate air of \"languor.\"\n\nAlong with instituting the iconic theme, Vreeland first brought celebrities to the Met Gala. Under her watch, major popular artists including Andy Warhol, Diana Ross, and Cher rubbed shoulders alongside politicians like Henry Kissinger.\n\nAfter Vreeland's death in 1989, the fate of the Gala was up in the air. Wintour was brought in to host for the first time in 1995, shortly after her arrival as Vogue's editor-in-chief. The next year, however, the honors went to Wintour's rival Elizabeth Tilberis, fellow British expat and editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar. It was Tilberis, in many ways, who created the first modern Gala.\n\nTilberis's Met Gala was sponsored by Dior, which had just named a newly ascendant John Galliano artistic director. Diana, Princess of Wales, attended that year, fresh off her divorce from now-King Charles, appearing in a Galliano-designed blue satin slip gown. The look caused a sensation.\n\nThe dress, tame by the standards of today, represented Diana freeing herself from the strictures of royal life with a slinky, neglig\u00e9e-inspired look that surely would have been frowned upon by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nFor Diana, the gown was a piece of image-making that allowed her to make a statement without having to say a word. For Galliano and Dior, it proved their cultural relevancy and their ability to make clothes that spoke for the wearer. For the Met Gala itself, the moment was a breakthrough. It showed how important the Met could be when it came to both fashion and celebrity: a place where two symbiotic institutions could meet and be celebrated in the best possible light.\n\nAfter Tilberis died of cancer in 1999, Anna Wintour took over the Met Gala on a permanent basis. And Anna Wintour understands the value of star power.\n\nWintour has always had a canny sense of how closely fashion and celebrity are intertwined, and how much each depends upon the other. Under her reign, the cover stars of Vogue went from models to actresses. The Met Gala has followed suit. It's become a coveted celebrity ticket -- not least because going to the Met Gala and, ideally, serving as a co-host gives you a better shot of landing that Vogue cover. Wintour also makes sure that she and the Gala retain control over just how all those celebrities make their fashion statements. Frequently, she's the one who matches celebrities with designers.\n\nYou can track the slow evolution of the Met Gala brand under Wintour's watch. In 2005, a mere six years into the Wintour era and less than a decade after Diana's newsmaking moment, New York magazine allowed that Wintour's camp \"like[d] to think of the Costume Institute Ball, held this year on May 2, as a sort of Oscars for the East Coast.\" By 2019, 20 years into Wintour's reign, that nascent ambition was now conventional wisdom. The Sydney Morning Herald declared the Met \"the fashion Oscars\" without irony.\n\nWintour was helped along in her quest for relevance by the advent of streaming video and social media, both of which helped reinvigorate red carpet coverage. It was common now for pop culture die-hards to follow along on the internet with celebrity arrivals at major award shows and events, and to share their opinions of the fashion on Twitter and Instagram. Celebrities add to the intimacy of the affair by letting viewers into their prep process in streams and Instagram stories.\n\nIf modern technology is central to the Gala's relevance, it also provides a venue for Wintour to show off the Gala as a financial powerhouse. Every year the Gala has a new heavyweight corporate sponsor, frequently from the tech sphere. (This year's is TikTok; in the past they've included Instagram, Apple, and Amazon.) It still makes enough money to provide the Costume Center's entire annual operating budget. Last year, the gala brought in almost $22 million, with tickets selling for $75,000 each and tables for brands to buy starting at $350,000.\n\nThe Met Gala is now the event where celebrities come to reveal a new image or refine an old one, and where the public follows along on the internet with bated breath. Zendaya announced her transition from Disney star to adult actress by acting out a Cinderella transformation on the Met steps in 2019. Rihanna proved she had the fashion cred to read a theme with nuance and the charisma necessary to pull off a dramatic look when she showed up to the 2015 Met Gala, themed to the influence of Chinese fashion on the West, in an enormous imperial yellow fur cape from Chinese couturier Guo Pei. Kim Kardashian built parallels between herself and Marilyn Monroe when she arrived at the 2022 Gala in Marilyn's iconic \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress.\n\nThe Met Gala continues to fascinate in part because of the alchemy Wintour has created: an assemblage of dozens of celebrities at the height of their fame, taking full advantage of fashion as an art form for image-making. Yet at the same time, the Gala remains a highly alluring mystery. Only Vogue is allowed to take photos inside the party, with the occasional highly curated exception (many attendees have made a tradition of bathroom selfies, where we see a Mad Libs-y melange of A-listers that only add to the party's mystique). The event itself is not televised. It is not livestreamed. It is not accessible to anyone who is not explicitly invited, which includes most of us.\n\nThe Gala is thus both highly visible and still a black box -- no small feat in an age of overexposure. It allows celebrities to speak to their public without words and then vanish off again into the night, unknowable and unreachable, the way almost nothing else in the social media era does.\n\nSometimes, though, the heady, decadent fantasy of the Met Gala can become a liability. This year, protests over the war in Gaza are raging across the city as the museum prepares for the Gala, with police arresting dozens of student activists on college campuses. Meanwhile, the Cond\u00e9 Nast union, locked in a bitter contract dispute with company management, is threatening one of Cond\u00e9's most lavish showcases with the possibility of a strike on the day of the Gala. Since Cond\u00e9 Nast includes Vogue, the potential for disarray at the Gala itself is high. It remains to be seen whether the public can remain enamored with celebrity opulence when real-world concerns are just outside, waiting to crash the party.", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "constance_grady@vox.com", "name": "Constance Grady", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Vreeland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana Vreeland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Editor-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Shaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dorothy Shaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vox (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The most hotly discussed topic? Whether or not the celebrities blessed with an invitation have dutifully followed the theme closely enough to the internet's liking.\n\nThe most memorable Met Galas are the ones that produced the most viral and 'on theme' moments. Last year's 'Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty' exhibit, and dress code In Honour of Karl, gave us Jared Leto dressed as Lagerfeld's famous cat, Choupette. 2019's 'Camp' theme featured Lady Gaga in not one, not two, not three, but four outfit changes on the Met steps. The year prior, Rihanna dressed as the Pope in honour of 'Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination'.\n\nEach year, equal time is spent discussing those who missed the mark, seemingly ignored the prompt or otherwise failed to meet the internet's expectations. Karlie Kloss \"looked camp right in the eye\", and Twitter lost its mind. It's all in good fun, but it's hard not to feel like it's flattening true fashion appreciation and critique.\n\nThis obsession with the themes, and the celebrities' keenness to go viral, has turned Met Gala commentary into a machine, where everyone's a critic and there's little room for nuance. Magazines and sites like Vogue.com are in the business of this commentary, too, except that, unlike the internet, their stories are less about quick-hit memes and more about showcasing celebrities, designers and the stories behind their looks.\n\nThe Met Gala's dress codes can often come across as esoteric, which is perhaps why some attendees misinterpret them or 'get them wrong', but they're important and romantic reminders of what the Met celebrates, which is not just fashion and its curation, but an annual exhibition by the Costume Institute. What I've always taken from the idea of a dress code is that it enables each night to differentiate itself from the last, and allows the Met Gala to stand out from any other red carpet for its ripeness for storytelling through fashion.\n\nAll of this said, the Met Gala theme has never been compulsory or mandatory, but rather a suggestion to guests and an opportunity to show up and show off.\n\nA quick history lesson: the Met Gala began in 1948 when publicist Eleanor Lambert -- who also founded the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1962 -- took it upon herself to throw a benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in the form of a private dinner somewhere in the city, not at the museum itself. Then came former Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, who took over in 1971, revamping the Met Gala and turning it into a glitzy and glamorous affair. She began hosting it at the museum, introduced themes and invited celebrities from Cher to Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John. The Met Gala as we know it started in 1995 when Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue and creative editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, took charge.

If your brand plays in this space, you can't afford not to take part,\" Talley told Forbes.\n\nHowever, Michael Burke, the ex-chief executive for Louis Vuitton, called Met Gala \"the pinnacle\" of his business and a \"very serious promotion machine.\"\n\nCelebrities across the US are set to make an appearance for New York City's largest fashion event on May 6.\n\nThe annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is themed as \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". The grand event will honor the fragile items, 50 antique designs conserved and maintained by the Costume Institute. Over 250 outfits will be on show, some of which have been recreated using sound scaping and digital animation.\n\nAlso Read: Who is Eugenio Casnighi? Italian model claims he got fired from Met Gala for stealing spotlight from Kylie Jenner\n\nNow, the question arises how the Met Gala makes money and how much does it cost to attend the fashion show.\n\nWhile Wintour chooses the guests, this does not imply that they will attend the ceremony for free.\n\nThe Met Gala exists to ensure longevity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. This party raises funding for the organisation's annual operating budget.\n\nWhen the Costume Institute joined the Met, it agreed to pay for itself. But surprisingly, the Met Gala generates so much revenue that a portion of it is returned to the museum.\n\nWhile the institute earned $22 million during the Met Gala 2022, prices go up every. Last year, the Met's official seat price was $50,000. It is now $75,000.\n\nYou must be wondering that you can just multiply the number of attendees by $75,000 to calculate the total revenue. No, that's not the case how it is done.\n\nThe minimum cost of the table at the Met Gala is $350,000, according to the New York Times. Do celebrities who attend the event as \"guests\" pay for the seat? While every ticket costs $50,000 this year, it does not mean that celebrities will pay the expensive price. According to WWD, designers typically purchase a table at the event and populate it with among the celebrities they are getting styled. Even on some occasions a person who bought an individual ticket get a chance to be seated on a table purchased by a brand.\n\nMoreover, this year's gala is dedicated to Lagerfeld, and Wintour's guests are already requested to adhere to a certain dress code. According to Vogue, there are \"wonderful ways\" for attendees to \"salute one of fashion's greats\" such as dressing in a \"modern-day\" style from Chanel or Fendi.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_Leon_Talley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louis Vuitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Wear_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Wear Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fendi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/06/1600x900/MET_GALA_1715002695243_1715002699491.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 673, "textEnd": 678}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The event will also kick off the latest costume exhibition titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" with \"The Garden of Time\" as the dress code.\n\nThe institute was renovated in 2014 as the Anna Wintour Costume Center with the help of the Vogue editor-in-chief whose name is at its doors. A trustee of the Met, Wintour has spent decades growing the gala into what the museum calls one of the \"most visible and successful charity events in the world.\"\n\n\"It was a society event. People weren't very excited about going to it,\" Wintour recounted to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in 2023. \"To take it over and try to make a night out of it was quite intimidating.\"\n\nWhat is the Met Gala, exactly?\n\nThe Met Gala is a fundraiser that brings together some of the biggest names in the most famed industries. Guests flock to New York City on the first Monday in May to show off collaborations with famous designers and brands on looks that take months to make.\n\n\"The Met Gala, it has always had one mission, and that is to raise money for the important work,\" Wintour said.\n\nGuests follow a yearly theme and work to reference historic garments, incorporate innovative ideas and execute intricate concepts that resonate beyond the walls of the Met.\n\n\"We are always interested in trying to reflect a cultural moment and what we feel is happening at the world in any given time,\" Wintour said about the invitees.\n\n\"Every year is different and we try and curate the guest list in a way that makes sense for whatever the theme of the exhibition is,\" Wintour said.\n\nIt's been the setting of notable and much-discussed pop culture highlights, from Rihanna's 2015 arrival in a lengthy Chinese cape, to Lady Gaga's multi-faceted reveals at the 2019 Camp-themed gala. Within the last decade, fashion nerds, critics and consumers review the red carpet with keen precision to understand, through photos and videos, the efforts -- and at times, mistakes -- that go into preparing for the event.\n\nWhat does inside the Met Gala look like?\n\nThough many have walked the steps into the museum and visited its exhibits, very few have done so wearing the finest pieces to party and spend thousands (sometimes millions) among titans in film, sports, business, music and society. That rarified allure is what draws many to follow and dissect the gala.\n\nHanan Besovic, the post-pandemic viral voice behind Instagram's @ideservecouture, will have a seat adjacent to the action. He will join a handful of influencers at the Mark Hotel -- where many gala-goers prep and primp for the event -- on the day of the gala in the Upper East Side, five blocks from the Met.\n\nThere, Besovic will watch the arrivals and make social content alongside a room of other fashion-obsessed creators hosted by Meta.\n\nAs the hotel's guests exit their temporary lair at the Mark after spending hours on hair, makeup and styling, they exit to a crowd of fans and press awaiting a first glimpse of their attire, before it's time to line up by the museum's steps.\n\n\"Everybody has one minute of our attention and then there's the next person,\" Besovic said.\n\nUsually, the first to show up are the event chairs. This year Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez co-chair with Anna Wintour.\n\nOne by one, celebrities are carefully shuffled through the carpeted steps of the Met, where thousands of global outlets standby to photograph and record every angle. The seamless choreography is seen by what Vogue says is millions via its viral streams.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala after the red carpet?\n\nWhat happens next is what fuels the most intrigue. In a vast contrast to what goes on outside, most of what occurs inside of the Met is not recorded.\n\n\"Those tickets are crazy expensive. The brands buy out tables,\" Besovic said.\n\nIt's widely known the night includes a dinner and a performance. Cher, Rihanna, Madonna and Lady Gaga have performed in years past, among the world's most coveted art and notable artists.\n\nVogue is usually the only publication with the inside scoop. In 2023, they previewed the gala's dinner portion, guided by what they say was one of Karl Lagerfeld's most famous gatherings: Paloma Picasso's wedding reception.\n\nThose dishes look dainty, colorful and healthy in Vogue's images, featuring chilled spring pea soup and \u014cra King salmon served on vintage plates with an assortment of fruit and vegetables for last year's attendees.\n\nAre pictures allowed inside the Met Gala?\n\n\"The only snippets that we get are from social media,\" Besovic says about the event's exclusivity.\n\nViral bathroom videos and selfies taken by celebrities are the only view inside. Katie Perry rushing back into her campy burger outfit for the 2019 gala after running into Jennifer Lopez near the stalls. The Kardashians posing with Paris Jackson and a gaggle of supermodels. Lil Nas X, Erykah Badu and Jack Harlow posing for a picture. Or, celebs post elevator videos, such as the viral moment with Reese Witherspoon chatting with Cara Delevingne, Zooey Deschanel and Kate Upton. These end up being the only glimpses inside the gala to scroll through before common folk hit the hay.\n\nWhat else do they do at the Met Gala?\n\nAs the gala ends, guests rush to the after-parties, many of whom bounce around New York City all night long. The Standard Hotel's \"Boom Boom Room\" usually hosts A-listers -- in 2023, singer and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e was at the helm, according to Women's Wear Daily.\n\nBrands and designers also unleash more fashion moments during the after-parties.\n\nIn 2016, when model Karlie Kloss hit the town after the gala, American designer Brandon Maxwell adapted her outfit for the \"afters\" by cutting her structured gown into a mini. This year, designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Shayne Oliver will debut a capsule collection, featuring about 50 pieces in the collaboration.\n\nA young boy's generosity, rewarded\n\nUkrainian who fled

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Met Gala 2024 is days away. Ahead of the star-studded event, there's one question that many people are asking about this year's guest list: Are the Kardashians invited?\n\nMembers of the Kardashian-Jenner family have been a mainstay at the Met Gala for the last 11 years. Last year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall graced the white, blue, and red carpet, honouring Chanel's long-time designer, Karl Lagerfeld. However, there's no guarantee any or all will show up on 6 May 2024 to celebrate the opening of the spring exhibit, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\".\n\nAccording to a 13 April Page Six report, Kendall Jenner is rumoured to be there alongside Rihanna, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, A$AP Rocky, Uma Thurman, and Cara Delevingne.\n\nAfter Vogue announced this year's theme, fans thought Kim may not attend for the first time since 2013 because the concept seemed like a dig at her. The exhibit will feature 250 designs, some so fragile they can never be worn again - the \"sleeping beauties\". The idea is for the historical pieces to be celebrated, preserving and reimagining them in new ways.\n\nIn 2022, Kim wore Marilyn Monroe's iconic \"Happy Birthday Mr President\" dress, borrowing the 1962 garment from Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum in Florida. The reality star only wore the dress to walk the steps, changing into a replica inside, but fans slammed her for exposing the piece to a different environment and accused her of damaging it. While Ripley's confirmed that the dress was perfectly fine after Kim wore it, people still shamed her for putting the latent delicate piece of history at risk.\n\nKim Kardashian, Kendall and Kylie Jenner all walked the Met steps for the 2023 Met Gala \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\". Kim wore a pearl look by Schiaparelli. The gown included a draped skirt and top made from over 50,000 freshwater pearls and over 16,000 crystals.\n\nKendall wore a black leotard with a matching cape by Marc Jacobs while Kylie wore a red Jean Paul Gaultier asymmetric dress with a matching two-toned robe.\n\nKim confirmed she'd be attending the 2023 Met Gala in an April Instagram post featuring none other than Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette.\n\n\"Had a date with @choupetteofficiel in Paris,\" she captioned the post, which featured photos and video of Kardashian with Lagerfeld's famous feline. \"We then spent some time at @karllagerfeld's office to get a little inspiration for the Met.\"\n\nPhotos in her Instagram post also showed Kardashian preparing for her Met Gala look, which is likely to be inspired by Lagerfeld's archival looks from his time as creative director of Fendi or Chanel.\n\nThere had been much speculation over whether the famous Kardashian-Jenner clan would be invited to the annual fashion event, which takes place every first Monday in May. Early 2023 reports seemed to indicate the Kardashians didn't make the cut because Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who is in charge of the guest list, was allegedly \"cracking down\" on who can attend the exclusive event. However, a source close to the Kardashian family told Page Six that the rumours weren't true.\n\nAnother source told Page Six on 13 April 2023 that Kim would indeed attend alongside another unnamed member of the Kardashian-Jenner family. We now know that was both Kendall and Kylie.\n\nKendall's appearance was less than shocking considering the supermodel has attended the Costume Institute's fundraiser since 2014. The 27-year-old model also posed for the cover of Vogue's May 2023 issue, which paid tribute to legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld ahead of this year's Met Gala. Jenner was among 10 models enlisted for the cover, including Gigi Hadid, Naomi Campbell, Anok Yai and Devon Aoki.\n\nSince 1995, the exclusive Met Gala guest list has been carefully presided over by Wintour. Tickets for the annual event - which raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute - go for $30,000 (\u00a323,000), while tables cost $275,000 (\u00a3211,000).\n\nKim attended her first Met Gala in 2013 alongside then-husband, Kanye West. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, who was pregnant with North West at the time, hit the red carpet in a floral Givenchy dress.\n\nKendall made her Met Gala debut the following year wearing a satin, custom made Topshop dress with Chopard jewellery. Kim and Kendall were joined by their famous momager Kris Jenner in 2015, while Kylie first walked the Met Gala steps in 2016 wearing Balmain.\n\nIn 2022, sisters Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian Barker attended the Met Gala for the first time. The Poosh founder arrived with her then-fianc\u00e9, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, where they gave their obligatory kiss for the cameras. Meanwhile, the Good American designer donned a gold Moschino gown for her first Met Gala.\n\nDespite attending the 2022 Met Gala, rumours circulated that Khloe Kardashian was allegedly banned from the fashion event. However, the reality star has since shut down speculation that she was forbidden from the Met Gala on Twitter.\n\nIn September 2021, a fan tagged Khloe and tweeted, \"Khloe now that you are online please tell [if] the Met Gala rumours are true,\" adding: \"Please clarify, thank you.\"\n\n\"Absolutely NOT true,\" she replied.\n\nKim turned heads at last year's Met Gala when she wore a bedazzled sheer beige floor-length gown previously worn by Marilyn Monroe. According to Vogue, the Skims mogul came up with the idea to wear the gown during the previous year's Met Gala, which celebrated the first part of the theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"\n\nLast year, celebrities and fashion lovers gathered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to honour the late Karl Lagerfeld. In September 2022, Vogue announced that the theme of the 2023 event will be \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\", which will \"examine the life\" of the late designer's fashion legacy. Along with Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, there will be four co-chairs of the event: Dua Lipa, Michaela Coel, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and Roger Federer, as announced by the publication on 18 January.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashian_family", "type": "wiki",

Granted, awards aren't being handed out, but that's only formally. Online, superlatives will fly around with wild abandon: best dressed, most on theme, biggest disappointment, etc. And so, while the 2024 Met Gala is May 6, many will be waiting for the next day to take in the deluge of posters on TikTok, Twitter, Insta, and wherever else exists to tell them what to think. But if you wanna judge everybody without external opinions you could also just ... watch the red carpet live. Pick your poison! Below, all the details about the 2024 Met Gala you need to celebrate (but mostly judge) the biggest fashion event of the year.\n\nThe Met Gala red carpet will be livestreamed exclusively by Vogue. That includes on Vogue's YouTube channel and on TikTok. This year's carpet coverage will be hosted by Gwendoline Christie, LaLa Anthony, and Ashley Graham, which, yes, is a confusing trio. Interviews will be conducted by influencer and coffee-brand owner Emma Chamberlain, as Vogue's \"special correspondent.\"\n\nSo there's two answers to that question: The exhibit the Gala is celebrating is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which celebrates garments that are too delicate to be worn again. The dress code is related, but not the same (which makes sense seeing as the garments are ... too delicate to be worn again). Celebs and their associated fashion houses will be following the \"Garden of Time\" theme. Expect lots of leaves.\n\nThe red-carpet stream begins at 6 p.m. ET on Monday, May 6.\n\nThe guest list is under wraps, but we do know that the co-chairs will be present. They include Anna Wintour (duh), Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth, Bad Bunny, and Zendaya, fresh off the Challengers press tour.\n\nMere days before the event, the Cond\u00e9 Nast union was threatening to picket the Met Gala because the bosses at Vogue's publisher wouldn't agree on a contract. Luckily, in the early morning on the day of the event, the unionreached a tentative agreement with Cond\u00e9, preventing the Met Gala from being picketed ... this time.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_p_frank@vulture.com", "name": "Jason P.

Not to mention, Met trustee and Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour, who will be joined by two honorary chairs - Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.\n\nThe annual event - undoubtedly the most iconic in the fashion calendar, is most known for its red carpet, with celebrity guests in their hundreds getting creative with the official dress code - announced each year.\n\nThe 2024 theme is \"The Garden of Time\", inspired by the 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. And judging by the famed work, we can expect a lot of gothic and dark florals on the red carpet.\n\n\"More modern, less delicate pieces imbued with the same spirit as the spotlit fashions,\" Vogue has written about the theme. \"Think melancholic florals (as moody florals aren't moody enough).\"\n\nBut most importantly, which A-list faces will be taking to the red carpet in the first place?\n\nThere is a lot of speculation around a potential surprise appearance from Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, and fans are hoping that Ryan Gosling might make his Costume Institute Benefit debut. But some of the biggest talk surrounds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, with hopes that royalty may grace the Met Gala.\n\nYes, social media sleuths have been predicting a Met Gala appearance from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but on closer inspection it could be unlikely, with only two members of the British royal family having ever attended in its history.\n\nThe first Mountbatten-Windsor to attend the Met Gala was Princess Diana, who famously arrived at the 1996 Costume Institute Benefit in a navy lace-trimmed silk slip dress from John Galliano's debut couture collection for Dior.\n\nOver 20 years later, Princess Beatrice became the second member of the British royal family to attend the Met Gala, making a surprise appearance in 2018 in an Alberta Ferretti gown.\n\nWill the third royal Met Gala appearance take place this year? Only time will tell.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loewe_(fashion_brand)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loewe (fashion brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

A parade of A-Listers dress according to the theme inspired by the Costume Institute's latest exhibition (some more than others) and walk the steps up to the museum before disappearing inside to enjoy the galleries, dinner and drinks.\n\nThe Met Gala is taking place on Monday night and it's time to place your bets: Which showstopping archival piece will Zendaya wear? Who will pull off the most uncanny stunt, topping Jared Leto's \"twin\" or Doja Cat's feline prosthetics? Inside, which celebs will flout the no-photos rule to sneak bathroom selfies? How late will Rihanna show up?\n\nWhat is this year's theme and who are the co-chairs?\n\nThis year, the theme for the red carpet is \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing a 1962 short story of the same name by British author J.G. Ballard. Like the New Wave sci-fi story, which takes place in a garden of time-bending florals, the museum's exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" highlights connections between nature and technology, using AI, CGI and other tools to breathe new life into hundreds of fragile archival pieces spanning hundreds of years. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, curator-in-charge at the Costume Institute.\n\nExpect fantastical fashion with floral and sci-fi motifs on the red carpet, and stylists working with luxury houses to resurface famous older looks. The first celebrities to appear will be Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, the last of whom is making his Met Gala debut.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nA frenzy of A-List arrivals and photographs, the red carpet portion of the evening's proceedings last for a few hours, but that's the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and have a seated dinner. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has \"final say\" over every guest in attendance, the New York Times has previously reported.)\n\nThough the red-carpet and afterparties get the most attention of the night, the gala is above all, a fundraiser, whose five-figure tickets raise millions of dollars for the museum each year -- setting a record at nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the recently-released book \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nWhat was last year's theme?\n\nThe conceptual theme is expected to be a change of pace from last year, when the dress code was set to honor the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019. Over the decades, tributes to the legacies of individual designers have included Rei Kawakubo, Charles James, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace, with the last two scheduled shortly after the designers' untimely deaths.\n\nTo celebrate Lagerfeld, celebrities including Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman and Jenna Ortega flocked to the event in designs by Chanel, Fendi and Chlo\u00e9, where he left his indelible mark, but some paid a cheeky tribute to Lagerfeld's cat Choupette as well (hence Doja Cat's whiskered beauty look). Not all were pleased with the theme to honor the controversial designer, however, given his history of disparaging remarks about women's bodies and his refusal to champion more inclusive beauty standards.\n\nWhen did the Met Gala start?\n\nThe Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the nascent Costume Institute, organized by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet reportedly cost $50 each.\n\nOver the decades, the gala has transformed from an industry fete at off-site locations like Manhattan's Rainbow Room into an A-List phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the fashion world and New York society. Wintour, her successor, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, turning the gala into one of the most-watched events of the fashion calendar -- and the year. In 2023, the software company LaunchMetrics found that the Met Gala generated nearly double the \"media impact value\" for brands than the Super Bowl, at $995 million.\n\nWhat was the first Met Gala theme?\n\nThe first theme was \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, tied to a retrospective of the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga; the event was attended by guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nEarly themes included \"Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,\" \"The Glory of Russian Costume,\" and \"The 18th-Century Woman.\" But gala-goers mostly kept to conventional eveningwear until the 2000s, when some guests began to have more fun with the themes -- and the internet allowed more eyes on the arrivals. The most memorable themes from the past decade have included \"China: Through the Looking Glass,\" \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and the divisive \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" thanks to celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners, who use the red carpet to put on a show.\n\nWho is banned from the Met Gala?\n\nEach year rumors fly about who may be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to any offense towards the event or Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor has only explicitly spoken about one guest she would \"never invite back\" in public -- Donald Trump, whom she mentioned on James Corden's late night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names.\n\nOther previous guests have sworn it off, however, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after she made an appearance at the event, Fey said on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that the gala is a \"jerk parade.\"\n\n\"If you had a million arms, all the people you would want to punch in the whole world -- they're all there,\" she said. \"I mean I was there, clearly I was one of them.\"\n\nSome celebrities backtrack, however. Gwyneth Paltrow famously called the Met Gala \"un-fun\" in 2013 and said she'd \"never\" go again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019).\n\nWhat shouldn't you do at the Met Gala?\n\nMet Gala guests have often broken the no-social-media rule to give a more candid glimpse of who is hanging with who and what goes on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson lit up cigarettes in the museum bathroom (to the ire of the museum's donors, reportedly).\n\nDespite what the Jason Derulo meme would have you believe, he -- nor anyone else -- has taken a tumble down the stairs. But some guests have famously rumbled -- this year marks ten years since the infamous after-party elevator fight between Jay-Z and Solange.\n\nA final faux pas? Wearing the same outfit, of course. While it's been reported that Wintour not only arranges the guest list but also has a hand in their fashion choices, last year, Olivia Wilde and departing \"Vogue China\" editor Margaret Zhang showed up in the same throwback Chlo\u00e9 violin dress in different color schemes.

Regardless if a celebrity is dressed on theme or not, it's the place to be seen when it comes to high fashion and celebrity culture.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRihanna, Kim Kardashian and Sarah Jessica Parker are just a few of the celebrities who attend the annual event, and the looks they show up in usually end up going viral. More is more at the Met Gala.\n\nAnd while these rich and famous celebrities get dressed to the nines for this exclusive party, we at home watch the red carpet at home and only wonder what it would be like to walk the red carpet at the esteemed Met Gala. If only!\n\nThe Met Gala takes place on Monday, May 6 and the theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and dress code is \"Garden of Time It will be interesting to see just how on theme some of the designers and celebrities will go, but regardless, it will be a feast for the eyes.\n\nSo in honor of the annual event, let's take a look back at some Met Gala looks from year's past that had our eyes wide open and jaws on the floor. Yes, these looks are that stunning and memorable.\n\nRihanna (2015)\n\nWhenever I think of Rihanna at the Met Gala, this is the first look that comes to mind. And honesty, that's saying a lot considering she knocks it out of the park every year she attends. The theme was \"China: Through The Looking Glass,\" and Rihanna made such a memorable impact with this entire concept and look.\n\nB\u00e9yonce (2015)\n\n2015 mst have been a good year, because B\u00e9yonce also killed it with that year's theme. From the high pony tail to the sheer fabric of the dress, she looked absolutely stunning.\n\nMadonna (2013)\n\nThe Queen of Pop has made some questionable fashion moments at the last few Met Gala's she has attended, but she really showed up in 2013 when the theme was \"PUNK: Chaos to Coulture.\" It was a fashionable choice for the theme, and one that Madonna has experimented in before. Way to go, Madge.\n\nKim Kardashian (2021)\n\nKim Kardashian has had MANY memorable looks over the years at the Met Gala. She's worn a dress once owne by Marilyn Monroe, worn a dress that made her look naked and walked the runway with Pete Davidson. Despite that, nothing was crazier than when she showed up in a Balenciaga gown that covered her from head to toe. Was it really her? Who cares! The insane moment instantly became iconic.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker (2014)\n\nSJP attends almost every Met Gala, so she has a lot of fabulous looks to chose from. While there are many, the \"Sex and the City\" star looks most like herself in this gorgeous gown. Oscar de la Renta designed this cupcake of a gown.\n\nKacey Musgraves (2019)\n\nWhen the theme for 2019 was camp, a lot of the attendees missed the mark. Camp is about being over-the-top and not afraid to reference. That's why when Kacey Musgraves showed up to the Met dressed as a real life Barbie, she instantly became one of the best dressed that year.\n\nLady Gaga (2019)\n\nLady Gaga was one of the few other celebrities to play into the camp theme. While it would have great if she went just a little bit further, but she really did a wonderful job of being over-the-top and dramatic when she entered the red carpet. She basically made it her own show.\n\nKaty Perry (2010)\n\nHer dress literally glowed. Obsessed!\n\nChadwick Boseman (2018)\n\nWe couldnt' have this list without at least one man on it, and no man has looked sharper on the red carpet at the Met Gala than Chadwick Boseman in 2018. From the fit to staying on theme, he really looked fantastic that evening.\n\nBillie Eilish (2022)\n\nBillie Eilish has attended the last few Met Galas, and she really brings it every time. Her 2022 dress was giving Gilded Age drama as the theme was about American fashion.", "source": {"uri": "local10.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPLG"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jessica_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Jessica Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponytail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ponytail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chadwick Boseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Eilish", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billie Eilish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kacey_Musgraves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kacey Musgraves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balenciaga", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balenciaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex and the City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_de_la_Renta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar de la Renta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Monroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katy Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Formal_Wear", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Formal Wear", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Fashion", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Theme_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Theme Songs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/J2KWQEWKAJF75LFXJHPKJ7OSDI.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1001, "textEnd": 1006}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

She's expensive, period.\"\n\nREAD MORE: AI predicts Met Gala looks: From Zendaya's stunning return to controversial Harry Styles", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Monday_in_May", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The First Monday in May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Styles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Styles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/1200x630/5358070.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

He carried a 26-foot cape with flower details and finished the look with pearl stud earrings.\n\nIt was designer Simone Porte Jacquemus' first time at the Met Gala and he told Vogue he knew who he wanted to bring as his guest.\n\n\"Bad Bunny is my favorite artist, it's a dream to dress him for my first Met Gala,\" Jacqumeus said in the interview. \"I was so inspired by him, he is the ultimate Jacquemus muse.\"\n\nMichaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings.\n\nThe \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who told Vogue she \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\"\n\n\"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover of American Vogue,\" Coel said in a behind-the-scenes interview as she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\"\n\nHer fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.\n\nLove it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.\n\nDoja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like.\n\nThe Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\"\n\nChoupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, has her own Instagram account with more than a quarter million followers.\n\nBlake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier Versace gown for the 2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"\n\nLively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.\n\nHusband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.\n\nLively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece.\n\nSpeaking of epic entrances, Lil Nas X put on a show at the 2021 Met Gala with three distinct looks from Donatella Versace.\n\nHe started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.\n\nThe fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"\n\nThe artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.\n\nNobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best.\n\nHer outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.\n\nReed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"\n\nIman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie.\n\nMaluma was the first reggaet\u00f3n artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope.\n\nHe joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.\n\n\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"\n\nHe also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.\n\nZendaya joins Bad Bunny as this year's co-chairs, and the fairy princess is quickly becoming a queen of the Met Gala. First there was Joan of Arc in 2018, then her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"\n\nWith the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.\n\nRoach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.\n\nAs for this year's look, he says Zendaya's dress won't even be fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview published Thursday. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"\n\nTime to work their Met Gala magic.\n\nThe Kardashians walked The Met steps together for the 2019 Met Gala and posed for an epic family photo.\n\nKim Kardashian donned a skin-tight corset dress from Thierry Mugler that looked as though she had just emerged from water. She was accompanied by her then-husband Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.\n\nHer sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott.\n\nAnd of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that was reportedly a last-minute suggestion from Kylie.\n\nThe Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021.\n\nOh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages.\n\nPorter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, he told Vogue that \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\"\n\nPorter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look.\n\n\"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said.\n\nBefore Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme.\n\nLady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath.\n\nThen she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots.\n\nThe whole theatrical performance lasted about 15 minutes and sent the crowd into a frenzy.\n\nCardi B made a bold statement in head-to-toe ruby red at the 2019 Met Gala. Her feathered gown featured a hood, giant train and reportedly 44 carats worth of rubies on the bodice.\n\nDesigner Thom Browne told Vogue he created this dress for her because she \"has the ultimate beauty in a woman's body.\"\n\nThe Bronx rapper was also covered in jewels at the 2018 Met Gala, when she was several months pregnant with her first child, daughter Kulture.\n\n\"Wifey is the truth, she just killed the Met Gala,\" her then-husband, Migos rapper OFFSET, posted on social media after the 2019 gala.\n\nJared Leto has been known for his extreme costumes, and the 2019 Met Gala was no different. He turned heads with a lifelike prop that looked much like his own head.\n\nAccording to Vogue, Leto took a page from Gucci's Fall 2018 runway show when model Unia Pakhomova carried a replica of her head as a clutch. His red gown and crystal harness were designed by Alessandro Michele for the fashion house.\n\nLeto outdid himself in 2023 when he showed up in a fluffy, full-body cat suit.\n\nSadly for his fans, he is reportedly sitting out the 2024 Met Gala because his band, \"30 Seconds to Mars,\" is touring in Europe.\n\n\"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" was the Met Gala theme in 2018, and Katy Perry soared in a giant set of angel wings from Versace.\n\nShe rocked a platinum blonde pixie cut with a gold mini dress and thigh-high boots. On top of that sat her huge wings that stretched from the floor to well above her head.\n\nThe singer pulled up in a vintage convertible before posing with the wings on The Met steps.\n\nThen, who could forget her outfit the following year, when she wore a crystal chandelier on her head and then dressed in a burger suit for the afterparty.\n\nFrances McDormand had the most fun with a whimsical headpiece from Valentino at the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nThe Oscar winner was photographed striking her best movie-star-pose as the massive headpiece nearly covered her whole face.\n\nShe was later seen in a social media video rocking out to the song \"Where's Your Head At\" inside the museum.\n\nTwo years later, McDormand appeared on the cover of Vogue, telling the publication, \"to still be culturally relevant as a 63-year-old female is so deeply, deeply gratifying.\"\n\nIt was almost impossible to pick the best Rihanna look, but her arrival for the 2015 Met Gala stole the show.\n\nThe giant yellow gown was designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei for that year's theme, \"China: Through the Looking Glass.\" Her dramatic train seems to have ushered in era of these dresses and their grand entrances.\n\nRihanna had back-to-back hits for the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: The Art of the In-Between\" theme in 2017 and for \"Heavenly Bodies\" in 2018.\n\nThen, of course, in 2021, she walked the red carpet with her partner, A$AP Rocky, while pregnant with their first child, RZA, and again in 2023 while expecting their second son, Riot Rose.\n\nThe naked dress isn't exactly new, but jaws dropped when Beyonc\u00e9 walked in wearing this to the 2015 Met Gala.\n\nThe floor-length dress from Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci featured strategically placed jewels but was otherwise see-through.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's stylist Ty Hunter says her 2015 gown was the heaviest one to wear.\n\n\"A lot of the rhinestones and gems, the rocky crystals, they were very heavy,\" he told Women's Wear Daily. \"It looked like the lightest ones because she looked naked under it, but it was one of the heaviest.\"\n\nQueen Bey's younger sister also made the list for the 2015 Met Gala with a head-scratching mini dress.\n\nSolange Knowles sported a futuristic design from Giles. While she told Refinery29 the dress \"gave the illusion of the fan,\" others compared it to an oyster, a sting ray or a computer background.\n\nSolange is known for taking fashion risks, and in 2018 she made headlines for asking her followers to vote for her outfit.\n\nAndre Leon Tally was a fixture at the Met Gala since 1974 and he hosted its red carpet correspondence until 2018. The former Vogue creative director died of a heart attack in 2022 at the age of 73.\n\nHe is seen here leaving The Mark Hotel as he prepares to host the 2015 Met Gala. That year, he praised Rihanna's gown as \"indulgent\" and \"luxurious,\" calling her the \"queen of the night.\"\n\nTalley's fashion career began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute where he took an unpaid apprenticeship under Diana Vreeland. Those who knew him said he didn't merely study fashion, he was obsessed with it since his childhood. He went on to work for Women's Wear Daily and Vogue, ultimately becoming the first Black man to be named creative director.\n\nSupermodel Kate Moss was the darling of the 2009 Met Gala in a metallic mini dress and matching headwrap from Marc Jacobs. That year's theme was \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion,\" and she couldn't have been more right for the part.\n\nMoss and Jacobs have worked on runways and campaigns together since the 1990s, dating back to his controversial grunge collection.\n\nMoss also gets points for her 1995 Met Gala look, when she wore a pale yellow Calvin Klein slip dress with a plunging back.\n\nIt goes without saying, but Sarah Jessica Parker is always one to watch at the Met Gala. Her career has seen countless head-turning looks, from a thrifted dress for her first Met Gala in 1995 to her oversized mohawk for the 2013 theme \"Punk: Chaos to Couture.\"\n\nOne look that stands out is her outfit for the 2006 Met Gala theme \"Anglomania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion.\" She walked in with Alexander McQueen wearing a short dress while he wore a jacket, tie and kilt, and they both had coordinating plaid sashes.\n\nParker later told Vogue she was nervous because she deeply admired the late designer and even kept scraps of fabric he used from their dress fittings.\n\nThe 1999 Met Gala theme was \"Rock Style,\" so who better to make a splash than Liv Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, and Stella McCartney, daughter of The Beatles' Paul McCartney?\n\nThe duo attended the gala together in matching shirts with the words, \"Rock Royalty\" scrawled on them. McCartney told Vogue she took a pack of Haynes shirts to a vintage shop in Little Italy, where she helped customize the final design.\n\n\"I didn't come at it intentionally to be rebellious at all. I didn't know what people wore,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't really appropriate that we wore those shirts. Officially, we weren't following the honors of the dress code. It was very cool and rebellious of Stella,\" Tyler added.\n\nFrom rock to royals, Princess Diana's appearance at the 1996 Met Gala goes down in history as one of the most memorable moments. The theme that year was \"Christian Dior.\"\n\nPrincess Diana made a statement in a blue floor-length silk slip dress from John Galliano for Dior and a pearl choker. Vogue described it as her \"most un-royal look to date,\" and said it signaled her freedom after her divorce and departure from the royal family.\n\nDozens of other royals have attended the gala over the years, including the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece who made multiple appearances in 1989, 1995 and 2001.\n\nVersace's designs have come up several times on this list, and the siblings behind the brand are on here for their leather and gold look at the 1996 Met Gala. That year's theme was Christian Dior.\n\nGianni Versace was the theme the following year, months after he was murdered outside his Miami Beach home.\n\nHis sister, Donatella Versace, took over the fashion house and has been a staple of the Met Gala since the 1990s. She dressed some of the biggest stars, and early photos show her arriving with Naomi Campbell in 1995 and posing for a photo with Madonna and Cher in 1997.\n\nSpeaking of Naomi Campbell, she made quite the entrance in this shimmering, floor-length gown at the Met Gala in 1995, themed \"Haute Couture.\"\n\n\"I loved this dress. It was slim-fitting and body-hugging, and just glistened,\" she told Vogue in a 2020 interview. \"I remember when I saw this dress for the first time, I thought, wow, Gianni, is that for me? It seemed like one of those dresses that you read in those fairytale books.\"\n\nCampbell made her Met Gala debut in 1990 wearing a multi-colored mini dress also from Gianni Versace.\n\n\"I was in such awe to first be invited by Gianni Versace through my new roommate, Christy Turlington,\" she said. \"You dressed up in the '90s... Enjoy your clothes, enjoy your accessories, enjoy your hair.\"\n\nCampbell said her most fun look was from 2019 when she wore a sheer Valentino Couture gown with a feathered cape and lace stockings that came together just hours before.\n\nCher, the woman who needs no last name, took the 1985 Met Gala theme, \"Costumes of Royal India,\" to the next level. She wore a sparkling gold and silver body suit with a large matching ear cuff.\n\nOther notable guests in attendance that year included Henry Kissinger, Raquel Welch and Barbara Walters.\n\nCher may have also been the first to wear a \"naked dress\" at the Met Gala when she made her debut in 1974. The dress had feathered sleeves and she wore her long, dark hair down loose.\n\nThe Queen of Motown, Diana Ross, was photographed wearing a flowing, strapless feather gown at the 1981 Met Gala. That year's theme was \"The Eighteenth-Century Woman.\"\n\nRoss sported a similar feathered jacket for the 2014 American Music Awards, when she presented Taylor Swift with the first-ever Dick Clark Award of Excellence.\n\n\"I'm so blown away to just have received an award from Diana Ross,\" Swift said at the time.\n\nBianca Jagger, a 1970s muse turned social activist, is seen here wearing a dark strapless dress with a full skirt and detailed embroidery at the 1981 Met Gala.\n\nHer classic Dior style inspired Kaia Gerber to recreate the look in 2021. Oscar de la Renta designed a similar gown, and Gerber wore her hair in waves parted to the side.\n\nGerber, who is the daughter of Cindy Crawford, described the dress in one word: \"elegant.\"\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former U.S. first lady, was known for her fashion that shaped the nation. She first attended the Met Gala in 1979 (\"Fashions of the Habsburg Era: Austria-Hungary\") and later served as co-chair.\n\nIn 2001, the Met Gala theme paid tribute to the style icon with \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years.\"\n\n\"Jacqueline Kennedy is one of history's great style icons,\" Vogue's European editor-at-large Hamish Bowles said in a statement at the time. \"Her profound influence on the way an entire generation wanted to look, dress, and behave cannot be overestimated. She set the standards that American women strove to follow, and, on the world stage, provided a visual metaphor for the youth and promise of the Kennedy administration.\"", "source": {"uri":

But sometimes, there are a few attendees whose arrivals are just as unexpected as the looks themselves.\n\nAhead of the 2024 Met Gala on May 6, we're looking back at the most surprising guests to have walked the famous steps in years past.\n\nRelated: All About the 2024 Met Gala, from the Co-Chairs to the Theme\n\nFashion royalty met actual royalty when Princess Diana graced the carpet back in 1996. For her first and only time at the Met Gala, Princess Diana wore a Dior navy lace slip by John Galliano. On her neck lay a sapphire brooch, a wedding gift from the Queen Mother, transformed into a dazzling necklace pendant strung with pearls.\n\nNo matter where they were, you could count on 3LW's Naturi Naughton, Kiely Williams and Adrienne Bailon-Houghton to bust out their highlights, crop tops and abs, which they did in 2001. What more could you ask for with an early aughts Met Gala?\n\nHillary Clinton, a two-time attendee, made her debut in a gold ballgown to support fellow former first lady, the late Jacqueline Kennedy, who was the honoree of the 2001 \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\" exhibit.\n\nDon't be fooled, this photo of Marilyn Manson and his now ex-wife Dita von Teese wasn't taken at a Halloween party. It was actually snapped at the 2007 Met Gala, where the rock musician wore his signature makeup with von Teese in a matching red lip.\n\nThe 2012 Met Gala was burnin' up extra hot when all three of the Jonas Brothers -- yes, Nick, Joe and Kevin -- showed face in coordinating tuxedos. This was the first and last time Kevin attended.\n\nBefore Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn broke up in 2015 after three years of dating, they were able to experience one date night at the Met Gala in 2013. They ditched their golf polos and ski suits in exchange for black-tie style.\n\nDerek Jeter and his wife, Hannah Davis, at the Met Gala is as unexpected as catching a flying baseball from the stadium stands. However, their debut in 2015 earned them a second invite the following year.\n\nThere's a small group of twins who've walked the red carpet: Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jared Leto and Alessandro Michele (they're not related, but passed as fraternal siblings once) and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who've been three times. Fun fact: the brothers -- who once claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook -- bumped into actor Armie Hammer, who played both Tyler and Cameron in The Social Network, at the 2017 Met Gala.\n\nRelated: Can You Guess How Many of These Celebs Have (or Haven't!) Attended the Met Gala?\n\nControversial news correspondent turned podcaster Megyn Kelly attended twice in 2016 and 2017. She hasn't been back since -- and described last year's Met Gala affair as \"trashy.\"\n\nEvery so often politicians make an appearance on the carpet, but Mitt Romney's night out on the town was the most surprising -- especially since he bought his tux on Amazon instead of going designer.\n\nJames Charles provided an eye-catching amount of influencer style to the Met Gala in 2019.\n\nThere wasn't any dancing involved, but Addison Rae's debut in 2021 still made a mark since she became one of the only TikTokers to attend. She returned the year after wearing Michael Kors.\n\nYouTuber Jackie Aina is considered one of the OG social media influencers of our time. But she didn't make her Met Gala debut until 2021.\n\nAnother TikToker who ruffled some feathers was Dixie D'Amelio. Although a newbie to the scene, she channeled a timeless look reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's when she arrived on the Met steps in 2021. She said on The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show that the ensemble wasn't the one she originally planned on wearing.\n\nPete Davidson's got jokes -- and style too, so much in fact that he's attended three Met Galas in a row! He made his debut in 2021 solo, then was accompanied by his now-ex Kim Kardashian (who can forget their Marilyn Monroe and her bodyguard moment), and then attended by himself again in 2023. That year, he reunited with the SKIMS mogul inside the f\u00eate.\n\nOn a rare occasion a parent will tag along as their kid's Met Gala date, such as when Elon Musk brought his mom, Maye Musk, in 2022. What also added to the shock factor: the tech titan flashing a duck face for the cameras.\n\nIn 2023, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes made their debut in coordinating black-and-white looks inspired by Karl Lagerfeld. Now that he's a three-time Super Bowl champ and she's Taylor Swift's BFF, will they be gracing the carpet once again?\n\nRelated: Met Gala Co-Chairs Through the Years\n\nThe same year the Mahomeses went, WNBA star Brittney Griner made her debut with her wife, Cherelle, just months after returning home from Russian imprisonment in December 2022. \"It's everything just to be here with my wife,\" Brittney told Vogue.\n\nOkay, so athletes at the Met Gala isn't groundbreaking, but having a sports star helm as co-chair with Anna Wintour is a rare occasion. Tennis champion Roger Federer took on the role alongside Dua Lipa, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Michaela Coel in 2022, making him the only sportsman to do so besides Tom Brady, who co-chaired in 2017.",

The couple attended a dinner hosted by Anna Wintour, where they showed off some fun and matching looks as they get ready for today's awaited Met Gala.\n\nHemsworth and Pataky wore striking looks. In the case of Hemsworth, he wore a dark blue jacket with a leopard print, which he matched with a silk black shirt and matching pants. Adding some color and vibrancy were some red tinted sunglasses. Pataky opted for a similar print and tone, wearing a dark purple crocodile-effect jacket that she paired with a light purple silk shirt and some shorts. She rounded out the look with heels and a matching crocodile-like clutch purse.\n\nThe Met Gala dinner was attended by the hosts of this year's Met Gala, including Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny.\n\nThe Met Gala will take place today, the first Monday in May, as it has occurred over the past years. While the party has long remained a mystery to audience members and fashion fans, the red carpet has become a highly entertaining moment, where celebrities show off some of their coolest and craziest looks.\n\nThe Met Gala red carpet kicks off today at 5:30 pm E.T. This year's theme will be the name of the new exhibition at the Costume Institute, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The exhibit will showcase \"clothing and fashion so fragile that it can't ever be worn again -- and are thus sleeping beauties in the scrupulous archives of the Costume Institute,\" per Vogue. The dress code of today's show is \"The Garden of Time,\" a name that's borrowed from a J.G.

With its extravagant themes, A-list attendees, and iconic red carpet-moments, it's a night that fashion enthusiasts eagerly anticipate.\n\nOf course, the red carpet itself is central to this spectacle -- a runway where celebrities showcase their interpretation of the year's theme with jaw-dropping couture. But when does this glamorous parade of fashion and celebrity begin?\n\nThe Met Gala red carpet officially kicks off at 5:30 p.m. E.T. Hosted annually at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, this event marks the beginning of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibition.\n\nAs the clock strikes half-past five, cameras flash, and the world's attention turns to The Met's grand steps, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the stars. Fans of the show can tune in to E! News or Vogue's official channels.\n\nWhile the red carpet action starts in the early evening, preparations begin long before. Media personnel set up their equipment and stake their positions hours ahead, ensuring they capture every moment as celebrities make their grand entrances.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the Met Gala is its fluid schedule. Unlike other red-carpet events with strict timelines, the Met Gala operates on celebrity time. While the official start time is 5:30 p.m., there isn't a set end time. Celebrities are known for arriving fashionably late, adding an element of unpredictability to the proceedings.\n\nRegarding the Met Gala, being fashionably late is not just acceptable; it's almost expected. Iconic late arrivals, such as Beyonc\u00e9 in 2015 and Rihanna on numerous occasions, have become legendary moments in Met Gala history. In 2023, Rihanna, accompanied by A$AP Rocky, made a dramatic entrance around 10 p.m.\n\nWhen it comes to late arrivals, Rihanna has a master's degree. Even Vogue's Editor-in-Chief, Anna Wintour, humorously acknowledged that Rihanna is exempt from the punctuality rule. The Barbadian singer consistently pushes the boundaries of fashion and timing, solidifying her status as a Met Gala icon. Wintour also has a special place for the singer in her heart.", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E!

Dozens of the most stylish stars will descend on the Met steps on Monday night for the 2024 Met Gala, celebrating the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute's new exhibit \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nThis year's dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same name. The exhibit, which opened for press previews on Monday morning, features approximately 250 rare items drawn from the Institute's permanent collection. Spanning over 400 years of fashion history, the pieces include designs by Schiaparelli, Dior, Givenchy, and more.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala hosts are Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth. For the most part, however, the 450-plus person guest list is kept completely under wraps. That being said, stars such as repeat attendees Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Blake Lively, Bradley Cooper, Billy Porter and others can be expected to be in attendance.\n\nOf course, for those tuning in from home, the most exciting part of the night is the red carpet, during which the attendees make their grand entrance and debut their themed looks. It's also the only part of the night that is broadcast to the public. Once the attendees enter the museum for the dinner and performance, pictures and video are strictly prohibited.\n\nThe best way to catch the red carpet arrivals online is on \"Live from E!: 2024 Met Gala,\" which airs on May 6 on E! from 3 p.m. PT/6 p.m. ET to 6:30 p.m. PT/9:30 p.m. ET. Those without cable can access E!'s coverage on a variety of live TV streamers such as DirecTV, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV and Sling.\n\nThe entire 2024 Met Gala red carpet will also be available on Vogue's TikTok and Youtube channel live streams, hosted by Gwendoline Christie, La La Anthony and Ashley Graham. Emma Chamberlain returns as the Conde Nast publication's special correspondent.\n\nOn Monday morning, after more than a year of talks, Cond\u00e9 Nast management inked an employment pact with hundreds of union workers at Vogue and other publications -- heading off a strike that threatened to disrupt Monday night's gala. Before the two sides reached an agreement on the terms of a new contract early Monday morning, Cond\u00e9 Union leaders had explicitly threatened to stage a picket line at the 2024 Met Gala. That would have presented the prospect of celebrities having to cross the picket line to get into the event. \"We're doing whatever it takes: Meet us at the table or meet us at the Met on Monday,\" the union said in a post on X Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type":

I like the idea of coming up with a way to dress that's more comfortable, that looks cool, that sounds good to me.\n\n'But other than that, I don't care.'\n\nShe said it was 'like punishment,' saying 'it's people doing an impression of having a conversation ... I don't like the farce. We're dressed up like a bunch of f***ing a**holes.' She attended again in 2017.\n\nSpeaking with Schumer, Lena Dunham said, 'You and I were literally sitting across from each other at the Met Ball, and it was like a crazy countdown to when we could escape.'\n\nShe then said of Kim Kardashian's ex Odell Beckham Jr: 'It was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards ... I was like, \"This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes.\"'\n\nDemi Lovato had 'a terrible experience,' when she went in 2016. 'This one celebrity was a complete b***h and was miserable to be around. It was very cliquey. I remember being so uncomfortable that I wanted to drink.' She went to an AA meeting afterwards.\n\nPriyanka Chopra said: 'The Met's always like, so much work for just that carpet moment...But..I have a complaint.\n\nShe is loved, but this look was maybe too Vegas showgirl: Celine Dion at the 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes On Fashion on May 6, 2019\n\nThis was a very different look for Taylor Swift.

No bread for dinner, I was so hungry after.'\n\n'My husband [Nick Jonas] ordered pizza by the time we got back to the hotel, so we were fine.' She then quipped: 'There goes my invite for next year.'\n\nLizzo said the event was 'really stingy with the liquor.'\n\nSza says she 'snuck out the back as soon as Lenny Kravitz hit the stage because I was feeling very like, \"Whoa, my anxiety's going crazy.\"'\n\nMadonna's daughter Lourdes Leon was grateful to attend in 2021 but said: 'You're just shoved into a room with all these famous people and you're supposed to talk to them and be their friend, even though you don't f***ing know them. That's not my vibe.' She added: 'I'm sure it's fun if you're someone who is friends with a lot of famous people, but I'm not. I didn't know who the f*** to talk to. I felt so awkward that I literally called my boyfriend in the middle of it.'\n\nTin a Fey said: 'It is such a jerk parade. If you had a million arms and all the people you would punch in the whole world, they're all there.'\n\nThe star who are banned from the Met Gala are Tim Gunn and Donald Trump.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ AT THE MET OVER THE YEARS\n\nBy Heidi Parker\n\nThe Bronx native has been at the splashy Met Gala in New York City many times over her career.

Garner stunned in a red Valentino gown.\n\nBut after making her first Met Gala appearance, she never returned. And it's not because she broke any of the Gala rules, or because she was never extended another invite.\n\nIn fact, Garner has revealed that the decision to not attend another Met Gala was one she made on her own.\n\nWhile talking with Vogue in December, Garner admitted, while getting ready for the day, that she doesn't attend the Met Gala because it scares her.\n\n\"I went to the Met Ball exactly one time. I found it a little scary so I haven't been back,\" she explained to Vogue.\n\nBut despite finding it unnerving, that doesn't mean Garner doesn't have any fond memories from that time. As she continued, that gorgeous red gown she wore is something she will always remember.\n\n\"But I wore that night, this magical red Valentino gown and I was [Valentino's] date and that was really majestic and special,\" she added.\n\nIt's unclear if Garner will ever make the decision to return to the Gala at least one more time.\n\nThis year, the Met Gala is celebrating its \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibit which is an ode to nature, and pays tribute to the \"natural world,\" according to Vogue. The Gala is also pulling inspiration from J.G. Ballard's short story from 1962 titled \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"The Garden of Time\" can be interpreted many different ways. But there is some consensus that Ballard's short story is a metaphor for the importance of preserving history and the affect time has on the past.\n\nThe night of May 6, the Met will hold its annual Gala which began in 1948. This year it is hosted by Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_vallone@miamiherald.com", "name": "Sara Vallone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valentino (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(American_magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seventeen (American magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Keepsakes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Keepsakes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/hl56tn/picture288345060/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/jen%20garner%20met.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1712, "textEnd": 1717}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Weeks before the event, many visit plastic surgeons for the \"Met Gala Glow\" cosmetic treatment. Here's what it entails.\n\nCelebrities want to look their best at the Met Gala, as it's the ideal opportunity to represent high fashion. And many A-listers visit estheticians and plastic surgeons before the event to ensure they look their best. Tara Adashev, a head nurse at Neinstein Plastic Surgery in Manhattan, spoke to The Sun about what celebrities are getting done before heading to the Met Gala.\n\n\"Many celebs have the same fears and worries about their appearance as normal people,\" Adashev shared with the publication. She noted that famous folks often opt to receive the \"Met Gala Glow\" to give their skin a \"glassy glow.\"\n\nSo, what does the \"Met Gala Glow\" entail? \"It's a cocktail that's completely just for your skin type,\" Adashev said. \"We're treating the needs of your skin -- not mine, not someone else's.\"\n\nTypically, the treatment begins with a $400 AquaGold facial. AquaGold is a 24-carat gold medical facial device that offers a microneedling procedure to deposit hyaluronic acid and fillers into the skin. This helps reduce pore size and texture. Patients who receive the procedure love it for its natural look. Celebrities receiving an AquaGold facial have it done 24 to 48 hours before an event (such as the Met Gala). The results last three to four weeks.\n\n\"By the time that kicks in, your skin is glowing, and your makeup goes on nice and smooth,\" Adashev explained. \"Everyone's really into the glassy skin, the doughnut glaze look.\"\n\nThe \"Met Gala Glow\" also includes the Lutronic Ultra laser, which costs about $800 per treatment. \"This is good seven to 10 days leading up to the Met Gala for skin tightening, skin brightening, anti-aging, pores, wrinkles,\" the nurse said of the procedure.\n\nFinally, celebrities typically top off their looks with Botox.\n\nNew York-based plastic surgeon Dr. Ryan Neinstein also discussed caring for celebrity clients before the Met Gala in 2023. He told DailyMail.com that he had to open up space the weekend before the Met Gala to ensure all of his A-list patients could be cared for.\n\n\"I am usually busy around this time of year, but for the Met Gala, we had to open up all weekend, as guests are trying to get their last-minute touches,\" he told the publication. In addition to Botox and fillers, the surgeon explained that famous folks wanted lymphatic drainage massages to release excess water and decrease swelling.\n\nTara Adashev, the head nurse who spoke to The Sun in 2024, also discussed the booming business in 2023. She explained that celebrities received Botox at the base of their nose before the event. \"An injection of 2-4 units will help the nose from down turning when you smile,\" she explained.\n\nNeinstein added that many of his clients were men in 2023. \"The male audience for these procedures has gotten bigger and bigger, and for this year's Met Gala, we are close to 50% male clients,\" he added.\n\nThe Met Gala typically hosts around 450 attendees; fans can't wait to see which celebrities attend the 2024 event. Unfortunately, the guest list is top secret until the event begins. But we know Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth will host this year.\n\nA fan on Reddit released additional names of celebrity attendees. They include Kylie Jenner, Cillian Murphy, Olivia Rodrigo, Hyunjin, Hailey Bieber, Lalisa Manobal, Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, Ryan Gosling, and Sabrina Carpenter.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com",

Bush Hager specified that during her longer interview with the Vogue editor-in-chief, which wasn't aired on Today, she asked if Swift was going to be at the Met Gala.\n\nAccording to the TV host, Wintour played it coy when responding to this question and said: \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\"\n\nBush Hager then addressed how Wintour's remark could add fuel to the fire of rumours about Swift making an appearance at the Met this evening. \"So that could be yes, that could be no,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Wintour didn't confirm if the \"Anti-Hero\" singer will be at the fashion extravaganza, there have been various reports that Swift won't make it. According to a report shared by TMZ last month, Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, both received invitations to the event, which is in support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's coveted costume institution.\n\nHowever, Swift will not be attending because the gala falls during the same week her Eras Tour will be returning from its break with a concert in Paris. This is no definitive reason why Kelce will not be going to the Met Gala, but TMZ reported he's likely skipping it because his girlfriend won't be there.\n\nAlthough it's uncertain if Swift and Kelce will in the Upper East Side tonight, other celebrities are confirmed to be there. The 2024 Met Gala co-chairs - Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - are guaranteed along with the event's hosts and sponsors: Loewe's creative director, Jonathan Anderso, and TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew.\n\nHours before the event, Lopez appeared on Good Morning America and even made a quip about her outfit. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at at the Met Gala, she said: \"Barely, ever.\" However, Lopez expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that, quipping: \"The Met Gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\nAccording to Page Six report shared last month, Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri are two newcomers to the Met Gala invite list this year. Additionally, a source speaking to the outlet said Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps too. Barry Keoghan is said to have gotten an invite for the second year in a row. We also know thatVogue's two red carpet hosts, La La Anthony and Emma Chamberlain, will be back again too.\n\nThough it's not been confirmed yet, the Kardashians and Jenners, Kim, Kylie, and Kris will most likely be in attendance as they're known to elicit buzzy red-carpet moments. Additionally, designers such as Stella McCartney, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, and Tom Ford are expected.\n\nAs set by Wintour, this year's dress code is \"The Garden of Time.\" Inspired by the 1962 JG Ballard short story, guests are expected to illustrate fleeting beauty like Count Axel's dwindling garden. The Elizabethan era is likely to be tapped, mimicking the concept of preservation, as well as organic elements, like floral embellishments.\n\nThe annual fashion event will also coincide with the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute exhibit, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Vogue. \"And invites us to discover the many facets of a work, to learn more about its history and, ultimately, to better appreciate its beauty.\"\n\nBut before celebrities show off their flower power, keep reading to get the Met Gala 2024 details.\n\nThis year's Met Gala celebrates the Costume Institute's new exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nHowever, this is not a reinvention of a Disney princess. It's about honoring clothes that are so fragile that they can never be worn again. Thus, these diaphanous fabrics and unique constructions are considered \"sleeping beauties\" in the museum archives.\n\nAs Andrew Bolton, chief curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said Vogue\"It's truly an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion.\"\n\nThe exhibition will also have three main zones highlighting the elements of the Earth: Earth, Sea and Sky.\n\nWhat inspired the 2024 Met Gala theme?\n\nFashion extravagance draws inspiration from everything from legendary designers to religion and futurism. But this year's Met Gala pays homage to the 1962 short story, \"The Garden of Time,\" written by author JG Ballard.\n\nThe book follows Count Axel and his wife as they listen to Mozart in their beautiful villa surrounded by a crystal flower garden. But outside their golden cage, an angry mob approaches their place of solitude. To keep the army at bay, Axel must go back in time by picking his flowers, one by one, until there is nothing left.\n\nWhat is the dress code for the Met Gala 2024?\n\nThe dress code for the 2024 Met Gala is \"The Garden of Time,\" which is inspired by the title of JG's short story. Although the theme can be interpreted in different ways, it is likely that we will see designs inspired by plants, flowers and other plants.\n\nFlowers ? For spring?

Her tour is set to resume May 9 in Paris.\n\nBut will she?\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Swift and Kelce for comment.\n\nSwift last attended the Met Gala in 2016 and wore a platinum short dress and bleached-blond hair for the \"Manus x Machina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology\" theme.\n\nThe singer hasn't returned to the event since. In that time, she has released six original albums, re-recorded four and launched two worldwide tours.Swift and Kelce, who went public with their relationship in September 2023, have yet to make their official red carpet debut, although they've appeared together at events -- like Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes' annual charity gala -- on several occasions.\n\nAfter Paris, the European leg of Swift's \"Eras Tour\" will be in full swing with concerts most weekends until Aug. 20.\n\nThis year's Met Gala dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" in honor of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition theme, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

A look at the price of entry for fashion's biggest night", "body": "Even the 2024 Met Gala isn't immune from inflation, it seems. The cost of attending the annual black-tie event, dubbed \"fashion's biggest night,\" is up sharply this year, with the price of an individual ticket soaring above the average down payment on a house.\n\nOfficially called The Costume Institute Benefit, the gathering of celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, design, sports and other industries supports the Metropolitan Museum of Art's acquisitions and exhibitions related to fashion. Attendees often wear outlandish attire in keeping with the event's theme.\n\nThe co-chairs of this year's benefit, held on May 6, are Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Wintour and Zendaya. It celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The dress code? \"The Garden of Time,\" according to The Met.\n\nThe exhibit's description provides some clues as to how to translate that into fashion. Hint: Pick styes that evoke nature. It features 250 garments spanning four centuries, which are \"visually united by iconography related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion and a vehicle to examine the cyclical themes of rebirth and renewal,\" The Met notes.\n\nBut because the gala is a fundraiser, the price of admission doesn't come cheap, even if you're on the exclusive guest list.\n\nFor invited individuals, the cost of entry to this year's gala is $75,000, The Met told CBS MoneyWatch. That's up 50% from last year's $50,000 price tag.\n\nA 10-person table starts at $350,000, according to The Met.\n\nWell, first they have to be invited. Not just anyone can buy a ticket or a table to the event.\n\nMeanwhile, many celebrities don't pay full freight. Instead, a design house typically springs for a table and invites guests they wish to host, one attendee confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch. So for some particularly glittering guests, attendance is free.\n\nAnna Wintour, who is Cond\u00e9 Nast's chief content officer, global editorial director at Vogue and a Met Trustee since 1999, controls the event's guest list. To date, under her leadership the event has raised more than $223.5 million for The Costume Institute, according to The Met.\n\nLast year's Met Gala raised raised nearly $22 million.

The exhibition endeavors to reanimate these artworks by re-awakening their sensory capacities through a diverse range of technologies, affording visitors sensorial 'access' to rare historical garments and rarefied contemporary fashions,\" curator Andrew Bolton told CBS News.\n\n\"By appealing to the widest possible range of human senses, the show aims to reconnect with the works on display as they were originally intended -- with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life.\"\n\nThe theme goes hand-in-hand with a dress code, dubbed 'The Garden of Time.'", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Museum_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Museum Stores", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2023/05/02/348974-untitled-design-2023-05-02t113316073.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

How It Has Become A Tradition in Fashion Now - News18", "body": "Fashion's biggest night out -- the Met Gala 2024 -- will see stars of film, fashion, music, sports, politics and social media descend on the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 6 to be part of the new exhibit - 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion'.\n\nThe theme will feature about 250 items drawn from the Costume Institute's permanent collection, many of which will be publicly showcased for the first time.\n\nLet us give you the lowdown of the biggest starry event of 2024.\n\nThe Met Gala is a charity event and fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. It has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition. It was first hosted in 1948 as a society midnight supper.\n\nAlthough the purpose of Met Gala is to raise money for the Met's Costume Institute, which was nearly $22 million last year, its red carpet has always drawn the world's attention, with 400-plus guests.\n\nPuerto Rican singer Bad Bunny, sensational Jennifer Lopez, Marvel stars Zendaya and Chris Hemsworth and Vogue Editor Anna Wintour have been spending a lot of time in the desert lately.\n\nIn the past, tech leaders including Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook have attended the gala, this time, the primary sponsor of the Costume Institute's exhibition is Show Chew, the chief executive of TikTok.\n\nThough the guest list is still a guessing game, but some of the biggest names in the business who regularly attend the gala are Beyonc\u00e9 and Gigi Hadid to Madonna and Rihanna. You'll also see designers attend with their muses: Marc Jacobs and Kate Moss, or Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re and Emma Stone.\n\nIndian film actor Alia Bhatt will also be attending the event. Reports suggest that she left for New York at night of May 4 to make her second appearance this time.\n\nOther high-profile partners who are likely to attend since their significant others are hosting are Ben Affleck and Tom Holland.\n\nOscars nominee Lily Gladstone has said she will attend and has teased a fashion collab involving a major designer and an \"unbelievable Indigenous artist\".\n\nReports say that German supermodel Gisele Bundchen will attend the event with her boyfriend jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. Kendell Jenner will be seen again, however, attendance of other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family remain uncertain.\n\nJoining this illustrious lineup are stars such as Olivia Rodriogo, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson and Cara Delevingne.\n\nThe dress code this year is 'The Garden of Time', inspired by JG Ballard's short story of the same title, written in 1962. So, floral and botanical looks can be seen at the Met Gala Red Carpet.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" the title of the accompanying exhibit, refers to garments from the Costume Institute's collection that have been \"in slumber\" and now will be on display, some too fragile to hang upright lest they disintegrate. Curator Andrew Bolton picked 250 pieces spanning four centuries.\n\n\"We have pieces of a dress, but it'll be great. It'll be great. It'll be great and if it's not great, I'm just going to keep reminding people of, you know, how great I did on the 'Dune' press tour,\" Zendaya's stylist Law Roach told news agency The Associated Press.\n\nNot the common man, companies buy tables for the rich and powerful people who get the invite. For example, a fashion label will host its desired celebrities for the event. A table of 10 starts at $350,000 this year. Meanwhile, tickets are set to be priced at $50,000 per person with prior approval.\n\nMet Gala 2024 will start streaming at 3:30 am IST on May 7. The star-studded occasion will stream on Vogue Magazine's YouTube channel, Instagram and site's homepage.\n\nIt is widely known that the night includes a dinner and a performance. Cher, Rihanna, Madonna and Lady Gaga have performed in years past, among the world's most coveted art and notable artistes.\n\nLast year's gala dinner included \"dainty, colourful and healthy\", featuring chilled spring pea soup and Ora King salmon served on vintage plates with an assortment of fruits and vegetables, as mentioned in a CBS report.\n\nEntering the museum, guests walk past what is usually an impossibly enormous flower arrangement in the lobby, with perhaps an orchestra playing nearby, and over to cocktails. Or, they head to view the exhibit. Cocktails begin a half-hour earlier this year, so they start at 5.30 pm, and last for about two hours, followed by dinner, as mentioned in an AP report.\n\nThe New York Times reported, \"The spring 2022 dress code, 'gilded glamour', had little to do with the corresponding exhibition, while the next year's dress code -- 'in honor of Karl' (Lagerfeld, of course) -- was a perfect match for the 2023 exhibition, dedicated to that designer's 65-year career\".\n\nThe 2019's 'Camp' theme featured Lady Gaga in not one, not two, not three, but four outfit changes on the Met steps. The year prior, Rihanna dressed as the Pope in honour of 'Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination', as described by Vogue.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's also invite-only and comes with a hefty price tag.\n\nThis year's exhibition pays tribute to the natural world. \"It is very much an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion,\" Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, told Vogue about the exhibition, which is shaped around three main \"zones\" -- land, sea and sky.\n\nWhile the theme is up for interpretation, expect to see co-chairs of the gala, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, dressed to impress.\n\nAs for other attendees, the guest list is usually kept hush, hush, with people wondering who they will see walk the iconic (and long!) carpet. Among the questions asked ahead of the first Monday in May are: Will Taylor Swift make an appearance at the Met Gala? Will she bring her boyfriend, Travis Kelce? Will the Kardashian-Jenners turn heads and will Rihanna once again be among the best dressed?\n\nFollow along as TODAY.com shares updates in real time about celebrities getting ready, arrivals, unexpected moments and more.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/iconic-met-gala-cz-240430-a676a6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 435, "textEnd": 440}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

While reflecting on her first-ever Met Gala appearance, she explained that even though the event is really fun, it's also quite nerve-racking.\n\n\"I first went when I was 18 years old, and Law [Roach] and I, my stylist, we've been working together since I was like 14 years old. But I remember being 18 and it was such an exciting and new experience,\" she said about the Met Gala. \"But still terrifying.\"\n\nAs the Euphoria star described some of the specific things she's nervous about leading up to the 2024 Met Gala, she also noted that this is her first time attending the star-studded event since 2019.\n\n\"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years,\" she explained. \"So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while.\"\n\nAfter Kelly Ripa suggested that designers \"must fight to the death to dress\" Zendaya for the event, the actor said that the TV host would \"have to talk to\" her stylist about that.\n\nZendaya then described how she looks at fashion \"as creativity\" during every occasion, whether she's walking the red carpet at a movie premiere or the red steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n\"Even in press tours, it's a way to continue the creativity from the film,\" she said. \"I like to just create characters, because ultimately sometimes, doing this for a living feels a little weird and awkward and I'm more of a shy, introverted person, so I get to create these characters. And like, 'I'm this woman today who wears a green suit.' You get to embody this character for a day and clothes can do that for you.\"\n\nThroughout the last month, Zendaya has been unofficially deemed a fashion icon for her tennis-themed outfits during the press tour for her new film, Challengers, where she plays a tennis player turned coach. With the help of her stylist, Zendaya has stunned in various green and white looks, from a dazzling dress with a silhouette of a tennis player on it to a gown embroidered with mini tennis rackets.\n\nThe Dune star will be attending the Met Gala for a sixth time next month, as she first walked the red carpet at the event in 2015. While she made an appearance at the four following Met Galas after that, she specifically turned heads in 2019, when she dressed up as the iconic Disney princess Cinderella. While walking the pink carpet at the time, she was accompanied by Roach, who was dressed as her fairy godfather and waved a wand that emitted dramatic wisps of smoke around her.\n\nBack in November, Vogue announced that the upcoming theme for the annual fashion fundraiser will be \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". According to Vogue, the exhibit will be centred around 50 historically significant pieces, some of which are far too fragile ever to be worn again. These are the \"Sleeping Beauties\".\n\nNearly 250 items will also be drawn from the Costume Institute's permanent collection, featuring designs from Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Givenchy to span 400 years of fashion history.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Ripa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Ripa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yves Saint Laurent (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Princess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney Princess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silhouette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/24/18/GettyImages-2148907923.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Maybe something, as these 13 former couples could prove\n\nThe Met Gala is a big night for the stars -- and not just because of the fashion.\n\nFrom on-the-carpet costume changes to engagement announcements and baby bump reveals, celebrities often use fashion's biggest night to make a statement -- sartorial or otherwise. And it's become one of the most important nights of the year for our favorite celebrities to reveal another thing that everyone is dying to know (besides who they're wearing): their relationship statuses.\n\nBut are celebrity couples who make their red carpet debut at the Met Gala doomed? It's possible: these 13 famous pairs made the Met Gala red carpet their first together, only to break up not long after.\n\nKim Kardashian and Pete Davidson first sparked relationship rumors in October 2021 when around Halloween, the pair was seen holding hands on a ride at Knott's Scary Farm.\n\nWhile the couple's first official red carpet was technically at the 2022 White House Correspondent's Dinner, the pair made their wildly buzzy Met Gala red carpet debut together not long after, in May 2022.\n\nThat Gala was also the one at which Kardashian sparked controversy for wearing one of Marilyn Monroe's most iconic dresses -- the \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress -- that the Gentleman Prefer Blondes actress wore to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to President John F. Kennedy in 1962. For his part, Davidson let his love shine at the event, showering Kardashian in kisses and helping her navigate the famed Met Gala stairs in the super-delicate dress.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2023, however, PEOPLE confirmed that Kardashian and Davidson had parted ways, with a source citing their \"busy schedules\" as a reason for the split.\n\nThe singer stepped out at the 2018 Gala with Bieber (then Baldwin) on his arm, causing fans to wonder if they were possibly making their red carpet debut as a couple (though they were both guests of designer Tommy Hilfiger that night, Mendes later told PEOPLE).\n\nMendes later clarified the pair's relationship in an interview with Rolling Stone.\n\n\"I think it was more of a zone of limbo,\" Mendes said in the interview. \"She's still one of the f---king coolest people ever -- she's not just a beautiful person visually, but she's one of the most beautiful hearts I've ever met. I think I'm an idiot to not, you know ... But you can't control your heart.\"\n\nThe 2018 Met Gala might just have been the catalyst for the end of the IRL \"Bughead.\"\n\nLili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse -- who met while playing lovers on-screen in the CW drama Riverdale and dated in real life for nearly three years -- made their Met Gala debut in 2018, confirming what fans had been speculating for some time.\n\nThe pair went on to date for two more years afterward, with Sprouse calling the relationship \"as real as it gets\" in an interview with GQ after the couple's 2020 split.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk and Canadian electronic singer-songwriter Grimes were first linked as a couple when they made their appearance at the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nIn a Vanity Fair interview in 2022, Grimes revealed that she and Musk were back together after a 2021 breakup. In the interview, Grimes called the relationship \"very fluid.\"\n\nHowever, the same day that the Vanity Fair story was released, Grimes posted to Twitter (now X) to say that the pair's relationship status had changed since the interview.\n\n\"Me and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he's my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now, I think Devin wrote that part of the story rly well. Sique - peace out,\" she wrote.\n\nThe pair have three children together, X \u00c6 A-Xii, Exa Dark Sider\u00e6 and Techno Mechanicus.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez had a history of making moments on the Met Gala red carpet.\n\nThe newly minted couple made their debut at the 2017 Met Gala, where Lopez stood out in a flowing mint-colored dress straight out of Old Hollywood.\n\nTwo years later the pair debuted another relationship milestone on the red carpet: their engagement! Lopez stood out again, but onlookers' eyes were only drawn to her 16-carat engagement ring.\n\nIn between these two events, the couple attended the Met Gala together again in 2018.\n\nBut the pair announced that they had called off their engagement in 2021, saying in a statement that they had \"realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so.\"\n\nAfter meeting for the first time at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2015, where they both performed on the runway, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd were spotted a year later on a dinner date at Giorgio Baldi in L.A. -- after the stars had split from their respective partners, Justin Bieber and Bella Hadid.\n\nThe singers made their relationship official on the red carpet at the 2017 Met Gala, one year after The Weeknd made his debut with Hadid.\n\nIn October, just five months after attending the Gala together, sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the pair had split.\n\nZayn Malik and Gigi Hadid -- who share daughter Khai, now 4 -- were an on-again/off-again couple from 2015 to 2021. The ex-One Directioner and the supermodel split officially in 2021 after Malik was accused of \"striking\" Hadid's mother, Yolanda Hadid.\n\nBut long before that, in the early stages of their relationship, the two walked the red carpet at the 2016 Met Gala, making their red carpet debut as a couple. The pair's outfits were complementary, both on point for the event's theme of \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.\"\n\nAlex Rodriguez is no stranger to gracing the Met Gala red carpet.\n\nIn 2016, the baseball player walked the red carpet with his then-girlfriend, 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki, reportedly arriving together in the same car as Wojcicki's ex, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nThe pair dated through 2016, but split up. The next year, Rodriquez was back at the Met sans Wojcicki, this time attending with J.Lo.\n\n\"He is on a press tour and she is working on her new album. And I think it's timing,\" said the source. \"They've been all over the place. They have not seen each other in probably two months.\"\n\nAfter beginning their relationship in February 2014, this couple made their official debut that May at the Met Gala.\n\nSarah Silverman and Michael Sheen went on to date for nearly four more years, eventually breaking up in late 2017 over Christmas.\n\nIn 2018, Silverman appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where she discussed her past relationship with Sheen.\n\n\"He moved back to the U.K. and his life is really there and my life is really not there, but I love him to pieces,\" she explained. \"If he's in town and we're both single, we will make love.\"\n\nChristina Ricci and Chris Evans dated for a brief period of time, appearing together on the red carpet at the 2007 Met Gala. However, the sparks fizzled soon after.\n\nIn July 2004, however, it was confirmed that the pair had called it quits.\n\n\"Kirsten and Jake remain the best of friends. Details regarding when and why their romantic relationship stopped are not being provided, but suffice it to say it happened some time ago. They are still very close,\" Gyllenhaal's rep confirmed to PEOPLE.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Sprouse", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Sprouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday,_Mr._President", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Happy Birthday, Mr. President"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Monroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Happy Birthday to You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Streams will also be available to US viewers on NBC's Peacock streaming platform and E!.\n\nInternational viewers can tune in via TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and X.\n\nYou can follow the BBC's live blog for updates.\n\nThe gala and its explosion in popularity has been overseen by Vogue's global editorial director Anna Wintour.\n\nWhat is this year's theme?\n\nThe Met Gala's theme often serves as a prelude to the Costume Institute's spring 2024 exhibition - and this year is no different.\n\nThe exhibit - Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion - uses technology to \"breathe new life\" into garments from the Met's archives so fragile they can no longer be worn and must remain under glass.\n\nArtificial intelligence, computer-generated imagery, X-rays and soundscapes will be used in \"creative and immersive activations designed to convey the smells, sounds, textures, and motions\" of these items, according to the museum's website.\n\nThe dress code for Monday's red carpet is The Garden of Time, which shares its name with a dystopian tale written in 1962 by JG Ballard, in which the last bastion of the super-rich is overrun by a working-class mob of the \"great unwashed\".\n\nCommentators are calling it an exploration of rebirth and renewal, and of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction.\n\nFor an event that celebrates affluence and excess in an age of economic uncertainty and global volatility, the theme may sound a little on the nose.\n\nCan I get tickets?\n\nThe short answer is no. Fashion's biggest night is a cocktail and dinner party for about 400 to 450 invited guests.\n\nWealthy celebrities and brands snap up all the available tickets and tables at the charity benefit.\n\nAn individual ticket goes for around $75,000 (\u00a360,000), more than the average down payment on a house.\n\nA 10-seat table starts at $350,000.\n\nIn 1995, Ms Wintour's first year overseeing the event, a ticket cost just $1,000.\n\nThe gala raised about $22m last year, when its theme paid tribute to late design legend Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nWho is hosting?\n\nMs Wintour has recruited four big names to serve as co-chairs at this year's event.\n\nThey are Latino music stars Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, US actress Zendaya and Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, making his debut at the gala.\n\nCo-chairs help promote the event, plan its theme and dinner, and arrive at the beginning of its red carpet portion.\n\nServing as honorary chairs are Shou Zi Chew, chief executive officer of TikTok, and Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of the Loewe's fashion house.\n\nTikTok - currently under the threat of a nationwide ban - and Loewe's are also sponsoring the gala and exhibition.\n\nWhat is the guest list for this year?\n\nThe guest list is always top secret, but several celebrities have already confirmed their attendance.\n\nRihanna has said she will be there, and we can expect her to be accompanied by her rapper-partner A$AP Rocky.\n\nPower couple Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not tipped to attend. Neither is Jared Leto, who often stands out among the male attendees.\n\nSpeculation is also rife over the likelihood of appearances by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is facing multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits, and Kendrick Lamar, who is locked in a heated war of words with rival rapper Drake.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

The charity event fundraises for the museum's Costume Institute. Usually, it also marks the opening of an annual fashion exhibition which guests get a preview of. This year's exhibition theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" Using nearly 250 items from the Met's permanent collection, each piece will be displayed in a new way, relying on digital elements like video animation, CGI and artificial intelligence to alter the appearance. The pieces span 400 years of fashion history and are divided by land, sea and sky zones to pay tribute to the natural world.\n\nJust as there is an exhibition theme, there is also a red carpet theme that guests will interpret and make their own, arriving with elaborate looks. The 2024 red carpet theme is \"The Garden of Time,\" after a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. While costumes are up to guests and designers, fashion lovers are anticipating lots of floral and botanic looks.\n\nExpect to see some big names on the carpet who attend every year: Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Gigi Hadid and Blake Lively.

News.\n\nAccording to Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the theme is \"very much an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion.\"\n\nDrawing inspiration from J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same name, the gala pays homage to a world where time and beauty intertwine in a lush garden setting.\n\n'The Garden of Time' dress code invites attendees to explore the theme through botanical-inspired creations, promising a red carpet adorned with florals, plants, and other elements of nature.\n\nFrom ethereal gowns to avant-garde designs, guests are encouraged to interpret the theme in their unique way, adding to the eclectic tapestry of fashion at the gala.\n\nJoining Anna Wintour as co-hosts for the evening are industry icons Bad Bunny, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nWith each bringing their flair and style to the event, the lineup promises an unforgettable evening of fashion and entertainment.\n\nBeyond the glitz and glamour of the gala itself, attendees will have the opportunity to explore the 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion' exhibition, which runs from May 10 through September 2 at the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nFeaturing approximately 250 garments and accessories spanning over 400 years of fashion history, the exhibition offers a sensory journey through the evolution of style.\n\nAs per E! News, visitors can expect to engage with the exhibits through various immersive experiences, including sensory capabilities such as smelling hats with floral notes and touching walls adorned with embroidered fabrics.\n\nNotable pieces by designers such as Schiaparelli, Dior, and Givenchy will be on display, alongside innovative presentations of garments too fragile to be worn again.\n\n\"By appealing to the widest possible range of human senses, the show aims to reconnect with the works on display as they were originally intended--with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life,\" Andrew Bolton expressed in a press release obtained by E! News.\n\nAs the fashion world eagerly awaits the unveiling of this year's Met Gala, anticipation is high for an evening that promises to blend art, culture, and style in a celebration of creativity and innovation.\n\nWith 'The Garden of Time' as its backdrop, the 2024 Met Gala is poised to transport attendees to a realm where fashion becomes an enchanting journey through the ages.

Since she burst onto the scene in the mid-2000s, the pop star has made six appearances at the A-list event, donning stunning gowns from designers like Oscar de la Renta and Louis Vuitton. Her first appearance at the annual Met Gala celebrating the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute was way back in 2008, when Miss Swift was still in her very first era.\n\nSince her Met Gala debut, Taylor Swift has appeared on the Met's steps six times from 2008 to 2016, when she co-hosted the event (and supposedly met Tom Hiddleston and Joe Alwyn). Given her star power, it seems highly unlikely that she has not been invited most, if not every, year since that last showing. Yet for reasons unknown, Swift has not walked the red carpet on the first Monday in May since, and perhaps never will.\n\nRelated: See Taylor Swift Through the Years\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will be held on May 6, with the theme \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and a dress code of \"The Garden of Time.\" Anna Wintour will be presiding over the event as she has for decades now, and we're certain to see plenty of stunning looks on the red carpet for fashion's biggest night.\n\nHere's everything we know about a potential appearance by Taylor Swift in 2024 and Swift's history at the Met Gala:\n\nWill Taylor Swift be at the 2024 Met Gala?\n\nWhile you can never count out a surprise, it looks like Taylor Swift will not be attending the Met Gala for the eighth year in a row. People confirmed that Swift would not be making an appearance as she is prepping for the European leg of her Eras Tour which begins on May 9 in Paris, France. According to air traffic records, her jet is currently in Paris, which confirms that she won't be attending. TMZ did report, however, that Swift was invited to the Gala this year, and Wintour pretty much confirmed the invitation in an interview with Today's Jenna Bush Hager.\n\n\"And [Wintour] said, 'I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit,'\" Bush Hager said. \"So that could be yes, that could be no, which is what the reports are saying.\"\n\nRelated: What to Know About Taylor Swift's New Album 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nEvery Look Taylor Swift Has Ever Worn to the Met GalaTaylor Swift Met Gala Looks\n\nAll six of Taylor Swift's Met Gala outfits ranging from her first appearance in 2008 at her most recent outing as a co-chair of the 2016 Met Gala.\n\nTaylor Swift first arrived on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a guest of the 2008 Met Gala. Only 18, Swift was fairly new on the scene, winding down the promotion of her self-titled debut album and no doubt already plotting the arrival of Fearless later that year. On her first outing, Swift stuck with her early career signature gold curls and a simple gold gown from Badgley Mischka. The theme of the year was \"Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy,\" but Swift played it fairly safe.\n\nIn 2010, at the end of her Fearless era, Swift made her second appearance at the Met Gala, which offered the fairly vague theme of \"American Woman: Fashioning A National Identity.\" Not one for taking big fashion swings, Swift appeared in a simple, cream Ralph Lauren gown. This is also the first appearance of Swift's signature red lip at the Met.\n\nSwift, and her red lip, returned to the Met Gala the following year, only a few months after the release of Speak Now. Stepping outside of her comfort zone a bit for the \"Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\" theme, Swift donned this J. Mendel gown, which included mesh and lace layers. It's easily one of her more interesting red carpet looks.\n\nAfter taking a year off, Swift returned to the Met Gala in 2013, as a guest of J. Mendel for a second time. This time, during the RED era, Swift donned a black gown with cutouts and a jewel collar. While not the most out-of-the-box look to walk the \"PUNK: Chaos To Courture\" carpet, it was quite dramatic for the pre-Reputation Taylor.\n\nThe following year, post-haircut and pre-1989, Swift wore this sumptuous pink Oscar de la Renta dress for the \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\" theme. This is Swift's most \"Met Gala\" look with its long train and stunning detailing. Swift kept her red lip, but paired it with the bob haircut that would define the era.\n\nThe 2016 Met Gala is one that will live forever in the minds of Swifties. To start, after five appearances in the previous eight years, Swift was asked to be a co-chair for the \"Manus x Machina\" technology-inspired gala. With her new platinum blonde hair, dark lipstick and metallic dress, Swift executed one of the most daring and iconic looks of her entire career. While her breakup with Calvin Harris, International Snake Day feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, and her disappearance from the public would not take place for several months, her Louis Vuitton ensemble seem to somehow predict the upcoming Reputation era. While still publicly with Harris, this Met Gala is also supposedly where she met not one, but two of her future boyfriends, Tom Hiddleston and Joe Alwyn. The 2016 Met Gala is also noteworthy as Swift has not appeared back at the event since. Will she ever return? Only time will tell.\n\nNext, 'Mastermind' Indeed!

Famous folks will dress to celebrate the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's latest exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" Kim Kardashian typically attends the Met Gala but has yet to confirm her attendance in 2024. Here's why fans suspect she'll arrive in style.\n\nKardashian-Jenner fans are eager to see which family members arrive at the Met Gala on May 6, 2024. Kim Kardashian has attended the event since 2013, when she first arrived pregnant with her daughter, North, and her then-husband, Kanye West. In 2022, she made a statement with a vintage Jean Louis dress once worn by Marilyn Monroe. In 2023, she wore a Maison Schiaparelli piece containing 50,000 pearls.\n\nIt's unclear if Kardashian plans on attending the Met Gala in 2024. So far, only Kendall Jenner is confirmed to have been invited. However, the Instagram account KimKJet tracks Kardashian's jet activity, and evidence suggests that Kardashian may be headed to the Met.\n\n\"Kim Kardashian's jet landed in Teterboro, New Jersey, United States. Apx. flt. time 4 h 13 min.\n\n2,459 mile (2,137 NM) flight from LAX to TEB,\" the account posted early on May 6, 2024. This location is just 30 minutes away from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. An earlier post from the evening of May 5, 2024, showed Kardashian's jet taking off from Los Angeles.\n\nGiven the theme, fans wondered whether Kim Kardashian would attend the Met Gala in 2024. The \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibit shows 250 historically significant designs that can no longer be worn due to their delicate nature.\n\nFans who keep up with the Met Gala remember Kardashian's infamous 2022 design. She wore Marilyn Monroe's \"Happy Birthday Mr. President\" dress, prompting ridicule. Headlines suggested Kardashian ruined the dress after photos of missing clamps and rhinestones hit the media. Later, the rumors that Kardashian ruined the garment were debunked, but the chatter affected her.\n\nAccording to The Independent, fans think that Anna Wintour and the decision of this year's theme aimed to dig at Kardashian's past choices.\n\n\"It's so ironic how this year's Met Gala theme is about fragile historic garments, but Kim Kardashian wore and destroyed the Marilyn Monroe dress to the Met two years ago, the call is coming from inside the house,\" a fan wrote on X.\n\nKim Kardashian posted about attending the Met Gala in the past. In 2023, she posted photos to Instagram of her with the late Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette Lagerfeld. In the caption of the photos, she explained that she was finding inspiration for her look.\n\n\"Had a date with @choupetteofficiel in Paris,\" she captioned the post. \"We then spent some time at @karllagerfeld's office to get a little inspiration for the Met.\"\n\nKardashian didn't post any evidence of Met Gala preparations in 2024. On May 5, 2024, she posted photos of her in Santa Barbara, California, next to her Tesla Cybertruck. The images show her wearing a low-cut, off-white, translucent dress.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_weiler@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Lauren Weiler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Monroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Schiaparelli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maison Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choupette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Choupette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Lagerfeld", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Lagerfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday,_Mr._President", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Happy Birthday, Mr. President"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kim-Kardashian-Met-Gala.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Ballard -- give designers creative freedom to actualize the theme in various ways, from more literal looks anticipated to incorporate floral embellishments or timepieces, to more abstract interpretations.\n\nWhat happens inside\n\nThe Met Gala's best-kept secret is what, exactly, goes on inside the museum's walls throughout the evening, with most of the fanfare occurring on the front steps ahead of the fundraiser that typically raises eight figures in donations from its 450-long guest list every year, according to Vogue.\n\nThe organizers enforce a strict no-phone policy, although a few sneaky snaps have made their way onto social platforms in years past.\n\nThere are, however, permitted photographers who release images after the gala and give eager outsiders a peek at the action, which typically involves a musical guest, dinner and a viewing of the spring exhibition.\n\nThe co-chairs\n\nEvery year, the Met Gala employs four celebrities to co-chair the event. This year's committee selection includes \"Challengers\" star Zendaya, multi-hyphenate Jennifer Lopez, actor Chris Hemsworth and singer Bad Bunny to co-pilot the evening alongside Anna Wintour, the global chief content officer of Cond\u00e9 Nast and editor-in-chief of Vogue who has helmed the gala since 1995.\n\nAccording to Vogue, this is Hemsworth's first-ever Met Gala attendance and Bad Bunny's third, while Zendaya has ascended the stairs five times and J.Lo 13.\n\nHonorary chairs for the night include prominent figures from the event's sponsors: Jonathan Anderson, Loewe's creative director, and Shou Chew, the CEO of TikTok.\n\nWintour's decision to invite Chew has sparked controversy, as the popular video-sharing app has fallen under intense scrutiny by the US government. Last month, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force the sale of TikTok or ban it entirely should it not be sold.\n\nTikTok has reportedly shelled out millions to support the gala, and an anonymous insider told Page Six that the \"deal was cut way before this bill passed.\"\n\n\"What does Anna do? Does she un-invite TikTok a week before? She can't,\" the unnamed source dished. \"Anna is the total dictator of this event every year, let her talk her way out of this one!\"\n\nNotable attendees\n\nEvery year, approximately 450 guests attend the Met Gala, and it's a battle of the fittest -- err, well, the most fashionable.\n\nIn addition to the co-chairs, Rihanna, a hotly anticipated guest, confirmed she would be in attendance on May 6, noting that her ensemble would be \"really, like, chill,\" in contrast to her past looks.\n\n\"I'm coming in as an extra this year,\" she said over the weekend at an event for the cosmetic line Fenty Beauty. \"I'm coming for dinner.\"\n\nShe will instead be focusing her energy on preparing for her upcoming shows for her blockbuster Eras Tour.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType":

A figure up 50 percent from last year's still astronomical $50,000 per ticket price.\n\nAccording to the Met, pricing for a 10-person table starts at $350,000.\n\nOne hotly-debated question each time the first Monday in May rolls around is: who ultimately foots the bill for the celebrities who populate the carpet?\n\nThe process begins with obtaining an invite - of course, not just anyone can purchase a ticket, even those willing to fork over handfuls of cash.\n\nAndrew Bolton, Anna Wintour and Jonathan Anderson attend the press conference for the 2024 Met Gala celebrating \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2024 in New York City\n\nOften, design houses, the backbone of the Met Gala's cultural relevancy, buy up tables and invite high-profile figures they hope to host.\n\nFor that reason, even the hottest celebrities, are rarely paying full freight for their spots atop the staircase.\n\nThe event is ultimately a fundraiser and has, to date, under the leadership of Anna Wintour, raised some $223.5million for the museum's Costume Institute.\n\nLast year, the gala raised about $22million.\n\nFamously, Anna Wintour - the frosty Cond\u00e9 Nast chief content officer, global editorial director at Vogue, and a Met Trustee since 1999 - supervises the tightly-controlled guest list.\n\nSome 400 guests attended the 2023 event, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThis year's Gala will take place around the Costume Institute's execution of its new exhibit: 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.'\n\nThe exhibit, which attendees will get an early viewing of this evening, celebrates the 'reanimation' of pieces from the institute's collection that have long-lived as 'motionless' artwork, as opposed to dynamic pieces that can be 'worn or heard, touched, or smelled.'\n\n'The exhibition endeavors to reanimate these artworks by re-awakening their sensory capacities through a diverse range of technologies, affording visitors sensorial 'access' to rare historical garments and rarefied contemporary fashions,' said exhibit curator Andrew Bolton.\n\n'By appealing to the widest possible range of human senses, the show aims to reconnect with the works on display as they were originally intended - with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life.'\n\nFamously, Anna Wintour - the frosty Cond\u00e9 Nast chief content officer, global editorial director at Vogue, and a Met Trustee since 1999 - supervises the tightly-controlled guest list\n\nChris Hemsworth (pictured) was singled out by Vogue editor Anna Wintour to co-host the 2024 Met Gala, in addition to Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and a small handful of other fashionable names\n\nThe Gala is also being honorarily co-chaired by Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew\n\nGuram Gvasalia and Doja Cat at the Monse Maison Pre-Met Cocktail Celebration ahead of Monday's event\n\nLineisy Montero at the Monse Maison Pre-Met Cocktail Celebration held at La Mercerie on May 5, 2024\n\nZendaya, currently in the middle of promoting her high-profile new film Challengers, will make a triumphant return to the Gala's red carpet\n\nJennifer Lopez seen leaving Anna Wintour's pre-Met Gala dinner. 05 May 2024 - the superstar actress and singer is one of Monday night's co-event chairs\n\nThe dress code for tonight's celebration follows the 'sensorial' appeal of the exhibit, as well as the concept of time as it relates to fashion and specific pieces of clothing.\n\nGuests have been asked to dress with the idea 'The Garden of Time' in mind.\n\nSome 250 garments from the institute's 33,000 pieces will be on display - many of them have never been shown before, and some, are reportedly too delicate to hang, lest they fall apart completely.\n\nHence, the exhibition's title 'Sleeping Beauties,' refers to the fact that some of the extremely delicate pieces will be displayed lying in glass cases, like the fairytale princess did.\n\nMax Hollein, the Met's Director, said: '\n\nThe Met's innovative spring 2024 Costume Institute exhibition will push the boundaries of our imagination and invite us to experience the multisensory facets of a garment, many of which get lost when entering a museum collection as an object.\n\n'Sleeping Beauties will heighten our engagement with these masterpieces of fashion by evoking how they feel, move, sound, smell and interact when being worn, ultimately offering a deeper appreciation of the integrity, beauty and artistic brilliance of the works on display.'\n\nMonday night's spectacle is being co-chaired this year by Chris Hemsworth, Bad Bunny, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, as well as Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type":

The stunning ensemble featured a sheer pink floral top embroidered with butterflies, which is most likely a nod to this year's dress code being \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by a short story by JG Ballard.\n\nThe Dune star completed the glamorous get-up with a pair of white Christian Louboutin pointed heels, wearing her hair in loose waves around her shoulders.\n\nMeanwhile, Lopez opted for a black strapless gown designed by Diana Qerimi. The dress featured crystal-like detailing all over and she added some extra height with a pair of black Casadei platform heels. The singer completed the look with a chic ponytail and a pair of dangling diamond statement earrings.\n\nHemsworth, who attended the dinner with his wife Elsa Pataky, 47, looked dapper in an animal-print design blazer that he wore over a black satin shirt for the dinner. The Thor actor added a pair of dark trousers and some orange-tinted glasses.\n\nPataky opted for a glittering blue sequin blazer and matching hot pants that she teamed with a purple silk blouse and a high ponytail for the evening.\n\nCo-chair Bad Bunny was also pictured arriving for the dinner wearing a dark blazer that he teamed with a simple white T-shirt. He wore the casual, but chic get-up with a baseball cap and glasses.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: Every Time Jennifer Lopez Went to the Met Gala\n\nSienna Miller, 42, and her boyfriend Oli Green, 27, were also among the attendees, with the pair enjoying a rare date night at the glitzy event. Miller donned a green suede one-sleeve mini dress for the dinner, that she teamed with some sheer black tights and a pair of pointed white heels.\n\nMeanwhile, Miller looked dapper in a black suit and white shirt that he left open at the top. It was revealed in January that the pair had welcomed their first child together. The actress is also mom to daughter Marlowe, 11, whom she shares with ex Tom Sturridge, 38.\n\nIn November 2023, Vogue confirmed that the 2024 Met Gala theme would be \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which is also the title of the corresponding Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibit, set to run from May 10 to September 2, 2024.\n\nLast month, co-chair Zendaya spoke about going up the Met Gala steps after a 5-year hiatus. \"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years. So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while,\" she said during an appearance on Live with Kelly and Mark on April 23.\n\nSpeaking about her stylist Law Roach, who she's been working with since she was 14, the star said, \"It's fun in the sense that I like to look at fashion as creativity.\"\n\n\"Even in press tours, it's a way to continue the creativity from the film. ... I like to just create characters, because ultimately sometimes, doing this for a living feels a little weird and awkward and I'm more of a shy, introverted person, so I get to create these characters. 'I'm this woman today who wears a green suit.'

Tonight, on May 6th, the fashion world will converge for a night of opulence, creativity, and philanthropy at the Costume Institute Benefit. With a theme that promises to ignite curiosity - \"The Garden of Time\" - this year's gala is poised to be nothing short of enchanting.\n\nAs the clock ticks closer to the event, anticipation is palpable among global fashion critics and enthusiasts. Speculation runs rampant about who will grace the red carpet, with names like Rihanna, Blake Lively, Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian, and Lady Gaga swirling in the rumour mill.\n\nBehind the scenes, meticulous preparations are underway for an evening that transcends mere glamour. Led by the indefatigable Anna Wintour, the gala serves as a vital fundraising initiative for The Costume Institute, with over $223.5 million raised to support the preservation and exhibition of fashion history. Tonight, as attendees don their interpretations of \"The Garden of Time,\" they'll not only celebrate fashion but also contribute to a noble cause.\n\nHere's all you need to know about the 2024 Met Gala:\n\nFor those unable to secure a coveted ticket, fear not! Vogue's got you covered for the fourth consecutive year, offering audiences an exclusive (and free) front-row experience to the fashion spectacle. The 2024 Met Gala live stream extravaganza will grace its digital platforms, including, TikTok and YouTube, kicking off on Monday, May 6th starting at 6:00 pm ET.\n\nThe event will be hosted by actor Gwendoline Christie, producer and actor La La Anthony, and model Ashley Graham, while the versatile Emma Chamberlain returns as Vogue's special correspondent, ready to chat with the night's A-listers! Prefer the traditional TV experience? E! has got your back with a live broadcast straight from the red carpet, starting at 3 p.m. PDT. Don't forget to tune in for an evening filled with magic and fashion finery!\n\nThe Benefit (also known as The Met Gala) marks the opening of The Costume Institute's spring exhibition -- this year, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion will reactivate the sensory capacities of masterworks in the Museum's collection through first-hand research, conservation analysis, and diverse technologies -- from cutting-edge tools, artificial intelligence, and computer-generated imagery to traditional formats of x-rays, video animation, light projection, and soundscapes. Approximately 250 objects spanning four centuries will be on view, visually united by iconography related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion.\n\nBut what about the dress code, you ask? This year, it's all about embracing \"The Garden of Time,\" drawing inspiration from J.G. Ballard's evocative tale of temporal manipulation (1962). Think botanical prints, archival pieces, and perhaps a nod to Botticelli's iconic \"The Birth of Venus.\" It's a theme that invites guests to explore the cyclical nature of fashion, where the past intertwines with the present to create a timeless tableau.\n\nAnna Wintour's hand-picked class of 2024 co-chairs for the full-blown-out black-tie event of the year will head the exclusive fashion spectacle. From the captivating Zendaya to the legendary Jennifer Lopez, the dashing Chris Hemsworth, and the trailblazing Bad Bunny, this dream team is set to elevate the event to new heights, alongside Wintour. Adding to the glamour are honorary chairs TikTok CEO Shou Chew and Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of Loewe, highlighting the event's esteemed lineup.\n\nAs the countdown ticks away and the Met Gala 2024 looms closer, the excitement is palpable to see a dazzling showcase of creativity and philanthropy, where fashion history will be made amidst the enchanting backdrop of the Garden of Time.

The exhibit will feature approximately 250 items from the permanent collection, rarely seen in public before. While Hollywood A-listers Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and Chris Hemsworth will co-chair the event, the red carpet is also expected to be a star-studded gathering. The festival and the media will share exclusive visuals; however, mobile phones are famously not allowed inside the event.\n\nThis, however, brings a big question with many wondering about the reason why inside pictures and selfies remain mysteriously banned at the biggest fashion night. Notably, this is one of the many rules that the guests are expected to follow if they want to remain in Anna Wintour's good books.\n\nWhy are phones banned at the Met Gala?\n\nBack in 2015, it was reported that a ban had been put on the use of social media at the event to clamp down on the guests spending most of their time on their phones. \"The use of phones for photography and social media will not be permitted inside the gala,\" a notice was sent to all guests as quoted by the Independent. While this remains an absolute rule for everyone, guests were seen flouting the rule in the past, including beauty mogul Kylie Jenner taking a bathroom selfie in 2017.\n\nApart from that, there are also a few other absolute rules that are to be\n\nfollowed without fail. These include entry restrictions on anyone under the age of 18, a ban on smoking inside the museum, food items with onion garlic or parsley banned from the menu, and strict seating arrangements, among other things.\n\nMet Gala 2024\n\nCelebrities from the land of film, fashion, music, sports, social media, and politics will ascend the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the first Monday of May to soak in the new exhibition this year.\n\nWhile the theme of the Met Gala refers to the title of the exhibit, it is accompanied by a dress code which is 'The Garden of Time'.

I don't like ordinary things,\" Lopez told Vogue on last year's Met Gala red carpet. \"I'm an entertainer, so I love sparkle and glamour.\"\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala is set to take place May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This year's Costume Institute exhibition theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" Zendaya, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth are joining Lopez on the invite as fellow co-chairs for the night. The dress code for the gala is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by a J.G. Ballard short story. Vogue's Anna Wintour has also communicated that ensembles should convey the idea of \"fleeting beauty.\"\n\nFrom an elegant Ralph Lauren look last year perfecting the Karl Lagerfeld theme, all the way back the singer's Dolce & Gabbana 18th century inspired lacy gown at her first Met Gala 20 years ago - Lopez knows how to make a splash.

The singer told Vogue on the red carpet: \"It's a mix of Karl and Ralph and me.\"\n\nFor an atypical Met Gala in the fall due to the pandemic, Lopez stepped out in a Western-inspired Ralph Lauren look with a slew of accessories to hone in on the American theme.\n\nLopez looked ethereal in a Valentino gown, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes and Harry Winston jewels.\n\nAccompanied by the designer herself, Lopez opted for a stunning (and sheer!) custom Versace gown.\n\nIn line with the \"Punk\" theme, the star rocked a spotted Michael Kors dress and a dramatic smoky eye.\n\nLopez, joined by then-husband Marc Anthony, went with a simultaneously delicate yet extravagant Gucci gown. The floral detailing made the already vibrant red ensemble pop.\n\nDiverging from her typical form-fitting silhouettes, Lopez wore a glistening Zuhair Murad gown for the \"American Woman\" theme.\n\nWith a theme like \"Superheroes,\" Met Gala attendees had many options for interpretation. Lopez decided to stick with a subdued blue Alberta Ferretti ensemble.\n\nThe singer and actress wore a silver Marchesa gown, accompanied by Anthony. The ensemble was considered at the time to be Lopez's most extravagant Met Gala look.\n\nLopez attended her second Met in 2006, changing her look completely from her first appearance. The singer wore a simple blush pink gown by Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nMaking her Met Gala debut, Lopez joined the Dolce & Gabbana designers for the night. The star was right on theme in a lacy black Dolce & Gabbana gown fit for 18th century.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_gardner@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Chris Gardner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "nicole_fell@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Nicole Fell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Lagerfeld", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Lagerfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce_&_Gabbana", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolce & Gabbana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_(fashion_house)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valentino (fashion house)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Ferretti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberta Ferretti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Zanotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuseppe Zanotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuhair_Murad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zuhair Murad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kors", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Kors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gucci", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versace", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Versace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1147434679-copy-1.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 604, "textEnd": 609}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

E! News recently obtained an interview where Met curator Andrew Bolton shared insights into what could lead to a celebrity's exclusion from future galas.\n\nDuring a candid conversation on CBS This Morning last May, Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor-in-chief, and Bolton revealed two cardinal rules: no smoking and no touching the artwork. Bolton emphasized, \"Those would be no-nos,\" recalling past incidents where stars flouted the rules, including smoking in restrooms despite strict policies.\n\nDespite the lack of an exact formula for scoring an invite, Wintour explained that the guest list depends on various factors, including the theme of the exhibition and the cultural zeitgeist. \"We're always interested in trying to reflect a cultural moment,\" she said.\n\nHowever, securing an invitation comes with a hefty price tag. A solo ticket to the Met Gala costs a staggering USD 30,000 (over Rs 25 lakh), while a table sets one back USD 275,000 (over Rs 20 crore). Yet, not everyone has to pay their way in; Wintour often extends invitations to up-and-coming designers and celebrities showcasing designers' work.\n\nThe event's exclusivity extends beyond its price tag. Organizers strive to maintain an intimate atmosphere, with attendee numbers typically capped at 500 to ensure a personalized experience. Even celebrities must earn a plus-one invite for their partners, as per E! News.\n\nBehind the scenes, meticulous planning begins immediately after the previous gala, with approximately 100 people working year-round to orchestrate the event. From the seating chart, meticulously crafted to foster networking opportunities, to the menu selection, personally curated by Wintour, no detail is left to chance.\n\nEntertainment plays a crucial role, with high-profile performers adding to the gala's allure. However, booking such acts often entails navigating significant budgetary hurdles, as documented in the behind-the-scenes glimpse provided by the 2016 flick The First Monday in May.\n\nSecurity measures are paramount, particularly for the valuable jewellery adorning attendees. The event's security protocols, shrouded in secrecy, ensure the safety of priceless pieces and guests alike.\n\nDespite its opulent facade, the Met Gala is not immune to controversy. Guests must adhere to a strict no-selfie policy, instituted by Wintour in 2015 to preserve the event's exclusivity. However, some celebrities, like Kylie Jenner, have flouted this rule, as per E! News.\n\nAs the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 gala saw stringent health protocols, including mandatory face masks and proof of vaccination. Yet, even with these measures, controversies arose, as seen in rapper Nicki Minaj's decision to opt-out due to vaccination concerns.\n\nIn essence, the Met Gala remains an enigmatic affair, steeped in tradition and exclusivity, where adherence to rules and protocols is paramount for securing coveted invites in the future.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will be held on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The Met Gala, often hailed as fashion's biggest night, will uphold its tradition by returning on the first Monday of May. This year's theme is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. Unlike previous themes, this year's focus will be on reviving unique garments from various centuries, offering a novel perspective to fashion enthusiasts.\n\nWhile the gala will celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, the official dress theme is The Garden of Time. This year's exhibition will feature significant pieces spanning over 400 years of fashion history, showcasing iconic designers such as Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, and Hubert de Givenchy.\n\nZendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny will serve as the night's co-chairs. The theme aims to celebrate delicate pieces of fashion that are often deemed too fragile for wear, affectionately termed the sleeping beauties.\n\nExcept for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI\n\nREAD | Meet actor, who was thrown out of first film, had 10 flops in 4 years, one film changed his life, is worth Rs 1200 crore", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E!

While guests gear up with trips to their facialists, stylists, makeup artists, dermatologists and personal trainers, the hotels, bars and restaurants that welcome them are upping their games, too. There are car services to be booked, Champagne bottles to be uncorked and $500 flower arrangements to be ordered for Met-bound out-of-towners. And the evening has become a key one for luxury brands, from fashion to fine jewelry to beauty.\n\nLast year the generated $995 million in just 48 hours in Media Impact Value over a total of 115,919 placements, according to Launchmetrics. The top five performing brands at last year's gala, which honored Karl Lagerfeld, were Chanel ($110.7 million in MIV), followed by Fendi ($32 million), Valentino ($24 million), Gucci ($20 million) and Schiaparelli ($16 million).\n\nA number of stars appeared on the gala's red carpet in looks from Lagerfeld's time at Chanel, Fendi and Chlo\u00e9, personalized iterations of the designer's own black-and-white wardrobe and kitschy tributes to Lagerfeld's beloved cat Choupette. A vintage Chanel look worn and shared by Dua Lipa (one of last year's hosts) on her Instagram account amassed $1.4 million in MIV alone. Chanel looks, designed by Lagerfeld, were seen on Nicole Kidman, Jennie Kim and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, among others.\n\nThis year's Met Gala exhibition is called \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the official dress code is \"The Garden of Time.\" Fashion brands are naturally working overtime to dress celebrities for Monday night's gala, knowing that there are a lot of benefits to having a star photographed in their dress, which they hope will generate an overall boost to image and sales, especially valuable in the midst of the current luxury slowdown.\n\nRobert Burke, chairman and chief executive officer of Robert Burke Associates, the consultancy, said, \"What we've seen coming out of COVID and award seasons in general coming back is a laser focus from the brands of using this [red carpet] as a platform to tell a story about a brand, their authenticity or their heritage.\"\n\nHe said dressing celebrities for the Met Gala is a way to reach more people than they ever could through traditional media, whether it's a magazine or an ad. \"Everyone tunes in with their iPhone for the red carpet. It seems like brands really look at it as a return on their investment. They continue to make major investments. Part of this also came about because the actors were on strike for so long, so this was a major opportunity for them. It [celebrity dressing] is a revenue stream. It's a business to get your clothing or jewelry on major celebrities,\" he said.\n\nAs for whether the Met Gala red carpet is as important as the Oscars or the Grammys, Burke said, \"I think the Met Gala is starting to eclipse it in many ways. The Oscars are known for movies, Cannes is also known for the movies, Grammys is music. This is really focused on fashion.\n\n\"The jewelry brands will have the jewelry that the celebrity wore right after the Met Gala in the windows and feature it. Or they'll have the dress the celebrity wore in the window after the gala,\" he said.\n\nHe also spoke about all the New York City activity in the lead-up to the gala. \"We've seen it in the last few days, the amount of celebrities coming to the city. That certainly affects the hotels, it affects the retailers from a shopping standpoint, the restaurants are crazy busy. And I think in many ways it energizes New York, and New York is so much a part of the fashion ecosystem,\" said Burke.\n\nIt appears that companies at all price levels want a piece of the action. \"Everyone wants to get involved. The bigger houses have a lot of manpower. This year, because of the 'Sleeping Beauties' theme, I imagine you'll see dresses inspired by the house's couture or vintage, or you could see actual vintage. At the Oscars, Anya Taylor-Joy had that Dior dress, inspired by a famous 1949 dress. This means a lot to the consumer. One, it's educational, but two, it separates these big heritage legacy brands from everyone else.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"Don't underestimate the amount of accessories, and certainly fragrance and makeup, that these things can sell, from the Dior and Chanel and countless others.\"\n\nHowever over-the-top this year's red carpeted bash might seem to armchair critics and social media fans, the benefit is essential for the Costume Institute as its annual fundraiser. To date, more than $223.5 million has been raised for the Costume Institute under the leadership of Anna Wintour, who has been a trustee since January 1999. Her term is slated to end in September. Twenty-five years ago, that May's \"Rock Style\"-themed Met Gala was decidedly more dressed down, with Stella McCartney sporting a one-shoulder \"Rock Royalty\" T-shirt and pants and Whitney Houston in a bedazzled white coat and slim black pants.\n\nAlthough New York City's Economic Development Corp. has not measured the Met Gala's economic impact on the city, the many days of frenzy around it generates significant business for some sectors, and does help to attract visitors to the Costume Institute in the months that follow. However, it's likely to be less than that generated by the weeklong New York Fashion Week, held twice a year, which the EDC estimates contributes nearly $900 million annually to the city's economy.\n\nTo be sure, the Met Gala helps spark tourism, not just in early May but in the months that follow, as well as museum visits, both of which are key to the city's economy. In 2023, 62 million visitors came to the city and that figure is expected to be higher this year, according to a City Hall spokesperson. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been a part of the festivities before and may be again Monday, joining Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Wintour, the evening's co-chairs. TikTok's CEO Shou Chew and Jonathan Anderson, Loewe's creative director, are the honorary chairs. In the case of Chew, the honor has sparked significant backlash and a potential political nightmare for Wintour given the looming U.S. ban on TikTok. A few of Wintour's fellow museum trustees declined comment after being approached by WWD.\n\nThe City Hall spokesperson said, \"Thanks to our city's world-renowned arts and culture, and events like the Met Gala, we are driving nearly $74 billion in economic activity into this city [as a result of the overall growth in tourism]. We look forward to welcoming back the Met Gala for another year in the greatest city in the world and seeing everyone in their finest looks.\"\n\nAs in years past, hundreds are expected to descend on the Upper East Side hoping to get a glimpse of their favorite VIPs. The New York Police Department will once again be on hand in the lead-up to and during Monday night's event. Asked if there will be an increased police detail as a precaution for any protests, a NYPD spokesperson said, \"The NYPD will have an adequate security deployment. There are no street closures.\"\n\nUpper East Side retailers, restaurants and businesses are keen to keep the traffic flowing. Matthew Bauer, executive director of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District, said that at a recent networking event for area store managers, \"All of the stores were talking about the excitement that the Met Gala brings. How many times a year does the spotlight from virtually every media network focus specifically on fashion and in this Upper East Side neighborhood? Even if this spotlight doesn't result in sales for that particular day, it aids all of the [300-plus] businesses that are here.\"\n\nHotels in the neighborhood have been booked solid for the days leading up to the gala, and those right after, with designers using the event as a reason to come to Manhattan and do interviews, store appointments or dinners.\n\nOne beneficiary is the Mark Hotel, whose general manager Etienne Haro observed, \"Increasingly, fashion houses and brands host events around Met Gala time, making it feel like a third fashion week, and positively impacting the length of stays.\"\n\nThe Mark is fully booked, and with guests who are making their reservations further in advance, according to Haro. The early booking trend is also evident in its restaurants and bars.\n\nKnown to be a hub for celebrities and high-profile designers, The Mark has \"a strong understanding of what is required for our guests to be safe and to feel safe during this major event. Like for all other facets, we always look for ways to improve our security setup and plan for any scenario,\" he said.\n\nThe hotel doesn't shy away from its A-list status by encouraging guests and non-overnighters to check out \"The Mark Red Carpet live\" via Instagram. The Mark is also known to be a base camp for major media outlets and fashion publications all day Monday, \"making it the most watched [of the] hotel happenings in the world,\" Haro boasted.\n\nLike The Standard, the Lowell, the Carlyle and the Bowery Hotel, The Mark is at the ready for its VIPs, whether they want to hail \"The Mark Pedicab\" to wheel over to the Met, or need an all-day supply of \"the best fried chicken in town,\" Haro said. The inevitable wardrobe malfunctions can be eased with swift assistance. \"The day is all about making the impossible happen. In hindsight, it is not so dissimilar to the daily life at The Mark,\" he said.\n\nThe Lowell is also fully booked. Ernesto, director of sales and marketing, said, \"We go above and beyond for all our guests. Most requests we can't share, but we go as far as recreating ateliers for designers to work with their guests.\"\n\nCabin Creative's founder Julia Flynn, who works with brands and celebrities, said, \"Where I see companies having the largest advantages are in hospitality; no one discusses the incredible leaps and hurdles it takes to get into the actual hotels that host everyone; the Carlyle, Mark, Bowery Hotel and funny enough The Pierre. It's increasingly becoming more challenging on the Upper East Side to find lodging for the celebrities, agents, managers, makeup artists, etc.\"\n\nOscar Blandi, who brought his salon back to The Plaza seven months ago, said bookings are up 10 to 15 percent before the big event. With 150-plus clients Met-bound, many are requesting updos and more formal looks. Blandi speculated about the residual effect of the Met Gala in terms of driving tourism, fashion trends, hairstyles and color preferences: \"When the news is good, clients have the inclination to stretch. But as soon as the news is bad, people get afraid. The type of clientele that we have ranges from young to older with everything in between. So you see how much the business grows, and then when something happens it drops. But then it goes back,\" he said.\n\nFlorists are also seeing a bump in business, seemingly fitting considering this year's dress code. Ovando, which has some celebrity orders, is seeing a 40 percent two-day boost. Owner Sandra de Ovando claimed, \"When you receive flowers from Ovando, it's an experience and experiences are more valuable than things. You feel taken care of, cherished and that you're an important person. You feel loved -- and happy.\"\n\nZez\u00e9's has seen orders pick up this week, with many ordering \"very colorful\" arrangements for out-of-town visitors, according to co-owner and manager Peggy O'Dea. People are spending more, $400 to $500 as opposed to the typical $250 to $300. The floristry is an art itself with floral designer, co-owner and husband Zez\u00e9, who still amazes O'Dea with some of his creations. \"It's just a natural thing with him. It's not forced at all. It just flows,\" O'Dea said. \"He reads what people want to express on those messages on the cards and then he expresses that in the flowers. It's quite a beautiful thing.\"\n\nTo get ahead of the 100-plus demand for bouquets, Belle Fleur NYC delivered some orders Sunday, which is usually a day off, in advance of Monday's blitz. With even more orders expected Tuesday and Wednesday, co-founder and creative director Meredith Waga Perez said, \"It's not just the celebs that are spoiled with the most exquisite flowers, but there's also the post-gala thank you bouquets to grace the desks of designers, jewelers and editors.\"\n\nLast year's Belle Fleur NYC created a bouquet and a floral crown for Elle Fanning's red-carpet appearance, which \"trumped all orders and limited the quantity of deliveries,\" Perez said. \"Our gift bouquets align perfectly with this year's Met Gala's theme, embracing a secret garden aesthetic with imported blooms such as peonies, English garden roses, tulips, delicate sweet peas, button ranunculus and trailing scented jasmine vines,\" she said.\n\nEven candy is in demand. Accustomed to working regularly \"within the high-fashion circuit for all fashion weeks and special events,\" BonBon is providing candy for two designers' entire offices and the celebrities they are working with or dressing, according to Sue-Jean Kang, senior events and marketing projects manager. (The candy store is also popular on TikTok with 42.1 million views.) \"We absolutely love Met Gala week. These brands are regular, longtime supporters,\" she said.\n\nRosanna Scotto, whose family owns the restaurant Fresco by Scotto, estimated an uptick of 20 to 30 percent this week. \"There are faces that we have not seen before in our restaurant, and ones we recognize. I think they are stylists and public relations people, based on their stylishness. They have a certain stye about them. They have taken things up a notch,\" Scotto said. \"You know that this is not your regular customer, although out regular customer is always stylish. The fashionistas are doing more of the fish [choices]. They're not the pasta lovers.\"\n\nLast year Scotto, a \"Good Day New York\" host, tried unsuccessfully to crash the Met Gala with cameras in tow. The longtime New Yorker was a familiar face with many of the New York City police officers on duty. \"They just thought it was hysterical. I schmoozed my way to where I couldn't schmooze any more. I did not get to the top of the stairs,\" she said. \"I tried to pass myself off as an invited guest, but I was dressed like I was from the Amish country. Everybody was laughing around us, because they knew that I was up to shenanigans. The people at the Met Gala are very serious.\"\n\nAgreeing how the media goes into overdrive year after year over the celebrity attendees, Scotto said that she, like many, is very interested in Amazon honcho Jeff Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez. \"I want to be a friend. I don't care -- I'll find a corset. I'll do something to hang out with that woman. And she was a correspondent for 'Good Day LA.'\"\n\nBut the night really is about fashion. And across the spectrum, brands have gotten involved in red carpet dressing, and have seen the benefits.\n\nTommy Hilfiger, for example, is dressing the eight-member K-pop band and Hilfiger ambassadors Stray Kids and actor Madelyn Cline, along with his wife, Dee. The Hilfiger looks will blend classic American cool with this year's theme, while staying true to the brand's signature red, white and blue color palette. The company said it views the Met Gala as an opportunity to showcase Hilfiger's designs to a global audience of style enthusiasts, stars of pop culture and media outlets on one of fashion's biggest stages.\n\nKerry O'Brien, founder, designer and CEO of Commando, the luxury intimate brand, has supplied intimates to stylists for every major award show, NYFW fashion show and red carpet moment, including the Met Gala. Although the intimate apparel is worn underneath and isn't necessarily visible on the red carpet, she sees many benefits.\n\n\"We are honored to be the brand that stylists trust for the biggest night of the year in fashion,\" said O'Brien. While she loves the media coverage, she said her goal has always been to support the stylist community and empower their clients to feel both comfortable and confident, no matter the occasion. \"Many of those celebrities have become loyal customers over the years,\" she said.\n\n\"More recently, we are finding ourselves on the red carpet not only as the perfect invisible underpinning, but our high-waisted briefs and thongs have been visibly worn by a number of A-list celebrities under sheer dresses. Our hosiery has also taken center stage paired with our high-rise bottoms (the 'no pants' trend),\" said O'Brien. She said that celebrities wearing their product on the Met Gala red carpet \"is obviously such a great endorsement of the brand.\"\n\nClaudia Cividino, president of Jared the Galleria of Jewelry, said, \"Our Jared Atelier collection has been chosen by notable celebrities for a handful of red carpets this year. This has been a very positive affirmation for us and a signal to consumers that we are elevating the Jared brand and our product. The Met is clearly one of the pinnacle events of the year. It is one of the biggest stages for high jewelry, and a perfect venue for our offering to shine with exquisite one-of-a kind styles with natural diamonds, fancy yellow diamonds, emeralds and more. We find our customers may either want to purchase these looks or seek inspiration to create a similar look using our custom design service, The Foundry.\"\n\nSpanx, too, has benefited from the red carpet action.\n\n\"Spanx has been a mainstay on the red carpet for over two decades -- since we're the inventors of modern shapewear. When it comes to special events, like the Met Gala, it goes beyond product placement for us; it's about fostering genuine connections and loyalty. Celebrities and stylists have come to rely on us for the big and small moments. Their brand love has helped maintain our leadership in the category by building consumer trust of our product,\" said Andrea Port, vice president, brand and integrated marketing at Spanx.\n\nMichael Fisher, a stylist represented by The Wall Group, feels events such as the Met Gala have really helped his career.\n\n\"I see it as an opportunity to push myself and grow as a creative. It has also been a career booster. In 2022 ['Gilded Glamour'] my client Sebastian Stan went as a guest of Instagram, and we did something out of the box dressing him in Pierpaolo [Piccioli's] Pink PP Valentino Collection while the rest of the guys were in crisp white tie. It was a padded bomber look and the first time a man wore total PP Valentino on a carpet. It caused quite a stir with so much engagement online,\" he said.\n\n\"That traction certainly had an impact on my work and professional profile. Brands, stars and publicists took notice and it has become a 'standard' -- one that has strengthened relationships and trust between brands and clients alike. They are more open to creative collaboration,\" said Fisher.", "source": {"uri": "wwd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WWD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rosemary_feitelberg@wwd.com", "name": "Rosemary

It's a fun night for fashion,\" remarked the 54-year-old.\n\nWhen the GMA host questioned whether she would be able to walk in her look, to which the Hustlers star replied, \"Barely, ever. The Met Gala looks are not about comfort.\"\n\nWhile talking about hosting the event alongside Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, Lopez told GMA, \"I was really honored to be asked to host it alongside Zendaya and Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth.\"\n\n\"Anna was gracious enough to ask me.

News.\n\nAlso Read | Preity Zinta Is Waiting for 'Good Script' to Collab With Salman Khan, Reveals Her Fave Film With Superstar.\n\nAccording to Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the theme is \"very much an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion.\"\n\nDrawing inspiration from J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same name, the gala pays homage to a world where time and beauty intertwine in a lush garden setting.\n\n'The Garden of Time' dress code invites attendees to explore the theme through botanical-inspired creations, promising a red carpet adorned with florals, plants, and other elements of nature.\n\nFrom ethereal gowns to avant-garde designs, guests are encouraged to interpret the theme in their unique way, adding to the eclectic tapestry of fashion at the gala.\n\nJoining Anna Wintour as co-hosts for the evening are industry icons Bad Bunny, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nWith each bringing their flair and style to the event, the lineup promises an unforgettable evening of fashion and entertainment.\n\nBeyond the glitz and glamour of the gala itself, attendees will have the opportunity to explore the 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion' exhibition, which runs from May 10 through September 2 at the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nFeaturing approximately 250 garments and accessories spanning over 400 years of fashion history, the exhibition offers a sensory journey through the evolution of style.\n\nAs per E! News, visitors can expect to engage with the exhibits through various immersive experiences, including sensory capabilities such as smelling hats with floral notes and touching walls adorned with embroidered fabrics.\n\nNotable pieces by designers such as Schiaparelli, Dior, and Givenchy will be on display, alongside innovative presentations of garments too fragile to be worn again.\n\n\"By appealing to the widest possible range of human senses, the show aims to reconnect with the works on display as they were originally intended--with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life,\" Andrew Bolton expressed in a press release obtained by E! News.\n\nAs the fashion world eagerly awaits the unveiling of this year's Met Gala, anticipation is high for an evening that promises to blend art, culture, and style in a celebration of creativity and innovation.\n\nWith 'The Garden of Time' as its backdrop, the 2024 Met Gala is poised to transport attendees to a realm where fashion becomes an enchanting journey through the ages.

Celebrities, designers, and stylists alike are all in crunch mode to prepare for tonight's Met Gala, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and featuring the theme \"Garden of Time.\" Expect lots of archival pieces and nods to nature. With the 2024 Met Gala mere hours away, here's everything to know ahead of that first red carpet look.\n\nThe official start time is 6 p.m., but we'll be updating you live whenever the first celebrity (or roach) hits the carpet, both here and on our socials.\n\nCo-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth will definitely be in attendance, and thank God. I need a Zendaya Met Gala moment desperately. Hopefully, beaus Tom Holland and Ben Affleck will be present as well. Rihanna confirmed her attendance, but here's to hoping she doesn't arrive later than 10 p.m. Last year, she was so late that other guests had already begun to leave. Honorary chairs include Jonathan Anderson of Loewe and Shou Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, meaning a gaggle of Loewe celebs (Mike Faist, Josh O'Connor, Taylor Russell, and Greta Lee, probably) and maybe -- but hopefully not unless it's Addison Rae -- some prominent TikTokers.\n\nAfter last year's ode to Karl Lagerfeld, the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art decided on something a little less controversial. The exhibition put on by the Costume Institute is titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and is set to focus on forgotten and fragile garments, including current pieces by designers Phillip Lim and Stella McCartney, and archival designs from classics like Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Hubert de Givenchy, to name a few.\n\nAs for the dress code for this evening (yes, they are different), its focus is \"The Garden of Time\" and can be a chance for attendees to take it very literally and play with the garden aspect or nod to time with more archival designs and pieces.\n\nThe last Met Gala Taylor Swift attended was eight years and three boyfriends ago, but Swifties have never given up hope that she will make a big couture comeback. This would not be a bad time for it -- between her massively successful tour, impending album release, and the most public relationship of all time, Swift is having an incredible year. Of course, her fans managed to dig up a few shreds of evidence that she could be there -- Swift's tour schedule gives her time to fly to New York on May 6, and her stylist Joseph Cassell allegedly followed a Met Gala fan account in February. But TMZ claims Swift and Kelce RSVP'd \"no\" to individual invitations, denying us their long-awaited red-carpet debut. -- Danielle Cohen", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A representative from the New York Police Department said that there were no street closures planned and that the police would have \"an adequate security deployment.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the attention is riveted on the fashion. This year's theme is a nod to the delicate and often untouchable pieces that will be showcased in the spring exhibition, which opens shortly after the Gala on May 10. The exhibition will feature around 250 pieces, some of which are so fragile they cannot be worn again, symbolizing the \"sleeping beauties\" of fashion's past.\n\nAndrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's curator, wrote in an essay about the exhibition, \"The extreme fragility of these garments precludes them from being dressed on a mannequin, so in the exhibition they are displayed flat in glass cases to prevent further deterioration.\"\n\nThe event, known for its exclusive guest list of A-list celebrities from various fields, including film, fashion, music, sports, and even politics, will be co-hosted by luminaries such as Zendaya and Jennifer Lopez, who are known for their iconic fashion statements.\n\nAs the world eagerly anticipates the red carpet arrivals, the event will be live-streamed for fans to witness the grandeur and creativity that define the Met Gala. This year's dress code, \"The Garden of Time,\" is expected to inspire a myriad of nature-inspired designs, with celebrities and designers bringing their interpretation of botanical beauty to the prestigious steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe Met Gala continues to be a celebration of fashion as an art form, where the historical significance of the garments is as important as their aesthetic appeal. The event not only honors the craftsmanship and creativity of designers but ensures the preservation and curation of fashion history for future generations.\n\nAs the countdown to the Gala begins, the anticipation builds for an evening that will surely be remembered for its opulence, innovation, and homage to the timeless beauty of fashion. But hopefully, it will not be remembered for the disruption brought by contract negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_App\u00e9tit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bon App\u00e9tit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannequin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mannequin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Quilting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0426.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1432, "textEnd": 1438}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

PageSix reported, citing anonymous sources, that celebrities among the invitees include \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" star and recent Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone, recent \"The Bear\" Emmy winner Ayo Edebiri, and Rihanna -- a frequent Met Gala guest who is considered to have worn some of the event's most iconic looks. Other invitees, according to PageSix, include Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Kendall Jenner, Olivia Rodrigo, Uma Thurman and Cara Delevigne.\n\nTikTok is a sponsor of the event and its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will serve as an honorary co-chair despite the app facing legislative challenges in the United States. According to a Met Gala press release, the \"exhibition and benefit are made possible by TikTok.\" TikTok has long been scrutinized by American lawmakers for its ownership by Chinese company ByteDance, and the House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would force ByteDance to sell TikTok or else face a nationwide ban. Chew was previously grilled by members of Congress in a March 2023 testimony over the app's ties to China -- though he denied the company is linked to the Chinese Communist Party -- and again in January 2024 alongside other tech CEOs about child safety. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., slammed Chew's involvement as \"disturbing.\"\n\nThe \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibit will feature 250 objects spanning four centuries from the Costume Institute's archive, which the museum said were chosen because of \"iconography related to nature.\" Andrew Bolton, the curator of the exhibit, told the Associated Press the display will organize the items on display by the themes of earth, air and water, as well as around the senses. Bolton told the AP some garments will be accompanied by scent, meaning \"the scent of the person who wore it, the natural body odors that they emitted, what they smoked, what they ate, where they lived\" will be part of the exhibit. Though exhibit attendees will not be allowed to touch garments, some textures have been reproduced as touchable wallpapers through 3D printing, Bolton said. The museum also said artificial intelligence, alongside other technologies like X-rays and animation, will be used to display some of the objects.\n\n$50,000. That's how much a single ticket to attend the Met Gala cost last year, with entire tables costing as much as $300,000 -- though designers reportedly often purchase tickets for the celebrities they are styling.\n\nThe first Met Gala was held in 1948 as the Costume Institute Benefit, a midnight dinner party, though it did not begin to transform into its modern format until then-Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland joined as a consultant in the 1970s. Themes of recent Met Galas include \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" in 2023 and \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" in 2022.\n\nWhether any celebrities confirm they will attend the Met Gala in the coming weeks. Last year, several celebrities confirmed on social media or in interviews that they would attend, but some kept their attendance a secret until they arrived -- including Rihanna, who was one of the final celebrities of the night to hit the red carpet.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Wintour still oversees the event and decides everything from the theme to the guest list.\n\nThroughout the years, the Met Gala has transformed into a multimillion-dollar fundraiser -- last year's event reportedly raised $22 million -- filled with unforgettable fashion, controversies, and canon-level pop-culture moments.\n\nAs the world awaits all that this year's party has to offer on May 6, here's a look back at 10 memorable moments in Met Gala history.\n\nAnna Wintour co-chaired her first Met Gala in 1995 and infused the event with Vogue's youthfulness.\n\nSimply themed \"Haute Couture,\" Wintour co-chaired her first Met Gala (then known as the Costume Institute Gala) alongside Annette de la Renta and Clarissa Bronfman in 1995 and has co-chaired every Met since, with the exception of the 1996 and 1998 events, Vogue reported.\n\nAs editor in chief of Vogue, Wintour infused the event with the magazine's sensibilities, transforming the guest list with the inclusion of popular actors, musicians, and supermodels like Christy Turlington, Naomi Campbell, and Kate Moss.\n\nHer leadership has helped transform the Met Gala into the cultural phenomenon it's known as today. Its set date on the first Monday in May, dress codes, and surprise performances all took shape during her tenure.\n\nPrincess Diana attended her first and only Met Gala in December 1996 wearing a full Christian Dior look.\n\nJust months after divorcing Prince Charles, Princess Diana attended her first and only Met Gala.\n\nThe theme of the year honored Christian Dior, so Diana chose a dress designed by John Galliano, who'd just become head of the legendary fashion house.\n\nThe navy-blue slip dress with black lace detailing quickly became a key moment in fashion history, with Business Insider reporting that the dress was later displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nAnother key detail of the look was her bag; originally named the Dior Chouchou, it was renamed the Dior Lady Di bag by the fashion house in 1995, per Vogue. Dior still sells the iconic Lady Dior bag, which retails for upwards of $5,500.\n\nIn 1999, \"Rock Royalty\" Liv Tyler and Stella McCartney broke the Met's traditional dress code with their casual looks.\n\nWith the theme \"Rock Style,\" it's hard to imagine that Tyler and McCartney, the daughters of famous Aerosmith and Beatles frontmen, created this iconic fashion moment by accident.\n\nAnd yet, that's exactly what happened. \"I didn't come at it intentionally to be rebellious at all. I didn't know what people wore,\" McCartney told Vogue in a 2020 video interview.\n\nThe designer said she \"must have found out about the theme the night before,\" so the morning of the Met, she took a three-pack of white Hanes tank tops to Filth Mart, a vintage rock-and-roll store, and customized them with the owner.\n\nAfter adding some studs and ribbons to the tops, McCartney took them to Tyler, and they each created their outfits. Tyler chose a black Comme des Gar\u00e7ons slip skirt, and McCartney opted for Chlo\u00e9 trousers she'd designed.\n\n\"It was an amazing thing, in a way,\" Tyler also told Vogue. \"We were just being ourselves.\"\n\nAs a result, a moment as authentic as this will likely never happen again.\n\n\"In this day and age, people would really plan it and overthink it intentionally to get attention in the media, and like, we really didn't, and that is what is so lovely about it,\" McCartney said.\n\nIn 2009, designer Azzedine Ala\u00efa and model Naomi Campbell dropped out of the Met Gala after his work wasn't included in the exhibit.\n\nWhen you think about models as muses, Naomi Campbell's relationship with designer Azzedine Ala\u00efa instantly comes to mind. The two shared a close friendship that lasted over three decades, and Campbell even referred to the designer as \"Papa\" due to his contributions throughout her life.\n\nSo, you can imagine the duo's surprise when Ala\u00efa's work was excluded from 2009's Met Gala exhibition, \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion.\"\n\nAla\u00efa had made seven dresses for the occasion but asked models not to wear them after learning of his exclusion. He told The New York Times in 2009, \"It would have been silly to have seven girls wearing my dresses at the party and not have anything of mine in the exhibit\" and said Wintour had \"too much power\" over the museum.\n\nCampbell stood by Ala\u00efa and chose not to go entirely.\n\nA spokeswoman for Campbell told The Times, \"As Naomi has been a muse of Azzedine Ala\u00efa for 23 years, she feels she doesn't want to attend unless she can represent his work.\"\n\nTen years ago, Solange Knowles attacked Jay-Z in the elevator at a Met Gala after-party.\n\nIn 2014, TMZ released footage of Solange hitting and kicking Jay-Z in an elevator at a Met Gala after-party before being restrained by security.\n\nThe family released a joint statement to the Associated Press 10 days later, acknowledging the \"great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident,\" but said \"the most important thing is that our family has worked through it.\"\n\nThe incident, though, has reportedly been referenced several times in music released by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z in the years since.\n\nFor example, in a 2014 remix of \"Flawless\" featuring Nicki Minaj from Beyonc\u00e9's self-titled album, she sings, \"Of course, sometimes s -- t go down / When it's a billion dollars on the elevator.\"\n\nJay-Z also appeared to take responsibility for his actions in the song \"Kill Jay-Z\" from his 2017 album, \"4:44,\" where he raps, \"You egged Solange on / Knowin' it all along / All you had to say you was wrong.\"\n\nMost recently, People reported that fans have speculated that Beyonc\u00e9's lyrics on \"Cozy\" from her 2022 album \"Renaissance\" might also be in connection to Solange's actions from 2014, as she sings, \"Might I suggest you don't f -- with my sis.\"\n\nRihanna had to \"choreograph\" her entrance to the 2015 Met Gala because of her gown's large train, which in turn became a meme.\n\nRihanna is one of the Met Gala's standout attendees, thanks in large part to her consistent commitment to the theme.\n\nIn 2015, she wore a yellow gown designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei to celebrate the Met's \"China: Through the Looking Glass\" exhibit.\n\nIn an appearance on \"The Graham Norton Show\" in 2018, Rihanna said she had to \"choreograph\" her arrival on the red carpet because of the size and weight of the garment.\n\nRather than getting into her limo with the dress on, she said it actually had to be put in the car first. She then got dressed in the limo with the help of six people who also assisted her out of the car and up the Met's stairs.\n\nWhile some celebrities were criticized for cultural appropriation and insensitivity, Rihanna's look was hailed as one of the best of the night. It even became a memorable meme with fans likening the round train to things like pizzas and omelets.\n\nTaylor Swift fans believe the songs \"Getaway Car\" and \"Dress\" were both inspired by her 2016 Met Gala appearance.\n\nThe star's strikingly different appearance wasn't the only memorable moment from 2016's Met Gala. Swift, who was in a relationship with DJ Calvin Harris, turned heads with her dance-off with actor Tom Hiddleston.\n\nSwift and Harris broke up the following month and she was seen with Hiddleston in Rhode Island shortly after. What's more, Swift also reportedly met actor Joe Alwyn, whom she later dated for six years, at the same event.\n\nFans suspect these interactions helped inspire songs like \"Dress\" and \"Getaway Car\" from her 2017 album, \"Reputation.\"\n\nOn \"Getaway Car,\" Swift appears to reference Hiddleston by singing, \"You were drivin' the getaway car/We were flyin', but we'd never get far/Don't pretend it's such a mystery/Think about the place where you first met me.\"\n\nZendaya said her Joan of Arc look from 2018 is one of her \"all-time favorite Met looks.\"\n\nZendaya's Met Gala looks are always memorable, but the metallic Versace dress from 2018 is particularly iconic.\n\nIn a 2024 interview for Vogue's \"Life in Looks\" series, Zendaya said her outfit at the \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" Met Gala was one of her \"all-time favorite Met looks.\"\n\n\"It was so heavy because of the beading, but it was so beautifully constructed, and it's Versace,\" she said. \"And typically, you know, I can handle a night out with my heels and everything -- I've been wearing heels for a long time -- but I don't know, it was something about a mixture of like wearing these platforms and like the heaviness of my dress, I was struggling.\"\n\n\"But it was all worth it,\" she added.\n\nIn 2019, Lady Gaga performed a 16-minute entrance routine involving four different looks.\n\nThe theme that year was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"\n\nIn collaboration with designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga and her team created a 16-minute entrance routine that highlighted four unique looks. The routine ended with the singer wearing a black sparkly bra-and-underwear set inspired by her early days performing.\n\n\"Me wearing fishnets and a bra and panty playing piano onstage, this to me was camp because it harkens back to cabaret,\" Gaga told Vogue in a behind-the-scenes video captured for 2019's Met Gala. \"Camp becomes camp over time, so for my last reveal to be something -- that is something -- that I did 10 years ago or even more, it's campy now,\" she said.\n\nMaxwell added, \"I also love the idea of being at the Met, at this event that's all about the clothes, with, you know, no clothes on.\"\n\nBlake Lively arguably wore one of the best dresses in Met Gala history to 2022's \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" event.\n\nBlake Lively's 2022 Met Gala look was \"an homage to New York City\" and its iconic architecture. She told Vogue livestream host La La Anthony that her Versace gown was inspired by the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, and Grand Central Terminal.\n\n\"My crown has seven spikes because the Statue of Liberty, she has seven spikes representing the seven seas and the seven continents, which represents inclusivity, welcomeness, and freedom. So, I thought that was sweet,\" she said.\n\nDetermined to leave no detail unaccounted for, the actor also asked jewelry designer Lorraine Schwartz to include 25 stones on the crown to match the statue's 25 windows.\n\nAnd, of course, for the grand finale, a bronze-colored bow at her waist unraveled to reveal the dress' turquoise-blue train, replicating the oxidation of the New York City landmark.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng":

Last year, it raised about $22m for the department.\n\nThis year, tickets were reported to be selling for $75,000, up by 50 per cent on last year's price, so it is expected to be an opportunity no one will want to waste.\n\nWhen is the 2024 Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala, also known as The Costume Institute Benefit, takes place annually on the first Monday in May and marks the opening of The Costume Institute's spring exhibition.\n\nThis year's will happen on Monday, 6 May, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, with guests arriving from 6pm (local time)\n\nWhat is this year's theme?\n\nThe title of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition for 2024 is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\n\nHowever, the forthcoming show is not a reference to the Brothers Grimm or Disney, but a celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile it can no longer be worn, hence the term 'sleeping beauties' from the archives of the institute.\n\nAbout 250 pieces from the institute's permanent collection, spanning four centuries - including some garments rarely seen in public and so delicate they need to be under glass - will be on view.\n\nThey will be visually united by images related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and fleeting nature of fashion.\n\nThe exhibition opens to the public on Friday and runs until 2 September.\n\nEach year there is also a dress code for the ball tied to the museum's exhibition.\n\nThis year's theme is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by Empire of the Sun author J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same name.\n\nIt tells of a Count Axel and his wife, the Countess, who live in a villa with a terrace that overlooks a garden of crystalline flowers.

What's the theme? Who is going?", "body": "It is arguably one of the biggest fashion events of the year, with designers showing off some of their boldest designs using the biggest pop culture figures as models.\n\nHere's what to expect.\n\nOn paper, the Met Gala is a fundraising dinner for the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (better known as the MET) in New York City.\n\nIt coincides with the opening of a new exhibition in the gallery.\n\nBut it's essentially a big fashion event where celebrities dress up in elaborate outfits.\n\nIt's run by Vogue, the major international fashion magazine.\n\nThe event itself is private, with a strict no-phone and no-social-media policy.\n\nBut the guests' journey between being dropped off to entering the building is extremely public, with hordes of photographers capturing the arrivals.\n\nIt's not like your usual Hollywood awards night red carpet - the outfits tend to be pretty outlandish.\n\nCelebrities typically team up with fashion houses to create a look that fits into the dress code, which changes every year.\n\nIt's almost a competition for who can be the most creative and extra, except there are no awards.\n\nThe Met Gala is held on the first Monday of May each year.\n\nThis year, that falls on 6 May.\n\nIt'll be Tuesday morning in Australia when the guests start arriving in New York.\n\nWe'll be covering the whole thing, with a live blog kicking off tomorrow morning so you can follow along as the stars arrive and the memes take over the internet.\n\nAnd we'll have a mega-wrap of the looks for you to scroll through a little later in the day.\n\nThe magazine will be broadcasting it on its website, as well as over YouTube and TikTok.\n\nThe guest list is secret up until the night before the Met Gala, Vogue magazine says.\n\nBut we know for sure that these four big names are coming:\n\nZendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth ... because they're hosting the event this year alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour.\n\nWe also know that Gwendoline Christie, La La Anthony and Ashley Graham will be there because they're co-hosting the red carpet coverage for Vogue.\n\nAbout 450 guests go each year, with many of them being key pop culture figures - think actors, musicians, models, fashion designers, athletes and even politicians.\n\nThe magazine is being tight-lipped about who is going this year but hints that it'll be a star-studded event.\n\n\"Some of the biggest names in the business regularly attend- from Beyonc\u00e9 and Gigi Hadid to Madonna and Rihanna,\" its website says.\n\nThe theme for this year's exhibition is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\n\n\"The forthcoming show has not to do with the Brothers Grimm or Disney,\" the magazine says.\n\n\"But rather the celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile that it can't ever be worn again - and are thus sleeping beauties in the scrupulous archives of the Costume Institute.\"\n\nThe official dress code for the Met Gala is The Garden of Time.\n\nThe magazine says the dress code was inspired by a short story by J G Ballard - which was called The Garden of Time.\n\nIt's about a count and countess who live in a grand villa, which is being threatened by an encroaching mob.\n\nHere's how the story was summarised in a BBC article from 2012:\n\n\"The garden contains crystalline flowers at the tops of whose stems are goblet-shaped blossoms, which when snapped from the stem, drain the garden of time and motion.\n\n\"Each evening the count snaps off one of the time flowers.\n\n\"As he carries the crystal blossom onto the terrace, the menacing rabble retreats and he and his wife are safe for another day.\n\n\"But the stems no longer bear fruit, the flowers are being used up, and the count realises that time could not be stopped forever.\"\n\nThe theme is for the exhibition, the dress code is for the event.\n\nHowever, we're expecting the two to blend.\n\nAnd, as always, we're expecting obscure interpretations of the dress code to manifest in some fabulously ridiculous outfits.\n\nIn the past few years, we've seen iconic fashion moments from Zendaya, Cardi B, Blake Lively, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Lady Gaga ... the list goes on.\n\nHere are some of the looks we've been treated to in the past:", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La La Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwendoline_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gwendoline Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Learn more\n\nThe first Monday of May is here, which means that it's officially time for the 2024 Met Gala. We've compiled everything you need to know about the event, including who will be in attendance and where to watch a free Met Gala red carpet live stream.\n\nHosted annually by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and a slew of high-ranking cultural figures, the Met Gala has become one of the season's glitziest and most exclusive events, often referred to as the Fashion Oscars. Tickets to the event reportedly go for about $30,000 a piece, and that's only after you've been invited by Wintour.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" with a \"The Garden of Time\" dress code. Attendees dress to impress and often interpret the themed dress code in creative ways. Memorable past themes include 2018's \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and 2019's \"Camp: Notes on Fashion,\" both of which received their fair share of criticism and attention.\n\nWe've got you covered if you're hoping to catch a glimpse of the Met Gala. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about tuning in. Plus, we have details on who you can expect to see tonight (and which global pop star might be missing).\n\nThe Met Gala will live stream exclusively through Vogue. Starting at 6 p.m. ET, the fashion magazine will stream the red-carpet arrivals. You can catch the live stream through Vogue's YouTube and TikTok accounts, as well as through the publication's website itself. The red carpet typically lasts for several hours (with most guests arriving by 8 p.m. ET, but some A-listers get there even later). No live streams or public coverage are available for the famously secretive event itself, which is held inside the Met.\n\nGwendoline Christine, La La Anthony, and Ashley Graham will host this year's live stream. Influencer-turned-coffee-mogul Emma Chamberlain will return as Vogue's special correspondent, who will be tasked with interviewing the celebs as they arrive.\n\nE! will also be covering the event starting at 6 p.m. ET. Ross Mathews will conduct interviews for the network. If you don't have cable, you can live stream E! via live TV packages like Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV. For Sling TV you'll need to select Sling Blue to access E!, which is available for $40 a month (with $20 off your first month). Hulu + Live TV costs $76.99 a month and comes with a three-day free trial. Plus, you'll get Disney+, ESPN+, and regular Hulu bundled in.\n\nVogue's website, YouTube, and TikTok will also be your live streaming answer in several other countries, including the UK. It will be a bit later in England, but the bulk of the action is expected to take place from 11 p.m. BST to 1 a.m. BST (6 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET), so you can probably catch the action before bed.\n\nYou should be able to access these live streams from anywhere, but if you're traveling and, for some reason, unable to access these options, you can always try setting a VPN to a US location and streaming it that way. Our go-to pick is ExpressVPN, a beginner-friendly option with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can check out our ExpressVPN review for full details.\n\nPeople are very curious as to whether Taylor Swift will make an appearance at the Met Gala. Previously a frequent flyer at the event, Swift hasn't attended since the semi-infamous 2016 gala. While conflicting reports have emerged on Swift's possible 2024 attendance, People reports that they've confirmed that Swift won't attend this year. This would have been a tight fit, considering that the European leg of the Eras Tour picks up on May 9 in France.\n\nWhile Swift likely won't be there, several other A-listers will be in attendance. In addition to Anna Wintour, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny will co-chair the evening. Other potential attendees could be hosts and sponsors, including Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. While the guest list is famously kept tightly under wraps, you can usually expect to see at least a few members of the Kardashian-Jenner family. Rihanna is also a frequent attendee.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lillian_brown@businessinsider.com", "name":

A parade of stars dress in the theme inspired by the Costume Institute's latest exhibit (some more than others) and walk up the steps to the museum before disappearing inside to enjoy the galleries, dinner, and drinks.\n\nThe Met Gala is Monday night and it's time to bet: What stunning archival piece will Zendaya wear? Who will pull off the weirdest stunt, Jared Letos' twin or Doja Cats' feline prosthetics? Inside, which celebrities will flout the no-photo rule to sneak in bathroom selfies? What time will Rihanna arrive?\n\nThis year's red carpet theme is The Garden of Time, referencing a 1962 short story of the same name by British author JG Ballard. Like the New Wave sci-fi story set in a garden of time-changing flowers, the museum's exhibition, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, highlights the connections between nature and technology, using AI, CGI and other tools to breathe new life into it. hundreds of fragile archive pieces spanning hundreds of years. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute.\n\nExpect fantasy fashion with floral and sci-fi designs on the red carpet, and stylists working with luxury houses to revive older famous looks. The first celebrities to appear will be Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, the last of whom is making his Met Gala debut.\n\nA frenzy of arrivals and A-list photographs, the red carpet portion of the evenings lasts a few hours, but it's the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and dine seated. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has final say on every guest in attendance; The New York Times previously reported .)\n\nAlthough the red carpet and afterparties get the most attention of the evening, the gala is primarily a fundraiser, with five-figure tickets bringing in millions of dollars for the museum each year, setting a record at nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the recently published book Fashions Big Night Out.\n\nThe conceptual theme is expected to be a change of pace from last year, when the dress code was to honor the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019. Over the decades, tributes to the legacies of individual designers have included Rei Kawakubo. , Charles James, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace, the latter two planned shortly after the designers' untimely deaths.\n\nTo celebrate Lagerfeld, celebrities like Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman and Jenna Ortega flocked to the event in creations from Chanel, Fendi and Chlo, where he left his indelible mark, but some also paid a cheeky tribute to pussy by Lagerfeld, Choupette (hence Doja Cats). mustachioed beauty look). However, not everyone was happy with the theme honoring the controversial designer, given his history of making disparaging remarks about women's bodies and his refusal to advocate for more inclusive beauty standards.\n\nThe Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the new Costume Institute, organized by fashion journalist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet would cost $50 each.\n\nOver the decades, the gala has grown from an industry party at off-site venues like Manhattan's Rainbow Room to a high-profile phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland made the gala the opening night of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the world of fashion and new society. Yorkie. Wintour, her successor, favored A-list musicians, actors and entertainment figures, making the gala one of the most-watched events on the fashion calendar and of the year. In 2023, software company LaunchMetrics discovered that the Met Gala generated nearly double the media impact value for brands than Super Bowl, at $995 million.\n\nThe first theme was The World of Balenciaga in 1973, linked to a retrospective of the fashion designer Cristbal Balenciaga; the event featured guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to Fashions Big Night Out.\n\nEarly themes included romantic and glamorous Hollywood design, the glory of Russian costume and the 18th century woman. But gala attendees mostly stuck to conventional evening wear until the 2000s, when some guests began having more fun with themes and the Internet made it easier to monitor arrivals. The most memorable themes of the past decade include China: Through the Looking Glass, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination and The Divide: Notes on Fashion from Celebrities such as Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners. , who take advantage of the red carpet to put on a show.\n\nEvery year, rumors swirl about who might be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to offense to the event or to Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor-in-chief only spoke explicitly about one guest she would never invite in public. Donald Trump, which she mentioned on James Cordens' late-night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names.\n\nHowever, other previous guests have vowed to drop out, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after making an appearance at the event, Fey said on the Late Show with David Letterman that the gala was a parade of assholes.\n\nIf you had a million arms, all the people you wanted to hit in the entire world would all be there, she says. I mean, I was there, clearly I was one of them.\n\nSome celebrities, however, are backtracking. Gwyneth Paltrow famous called the Met Gala was no fun in 2013 and declared it would never come again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019).\n\nMet Gala guests often broke the no-social-media rule to give a more candid insight into who's hanging out with who and what's going on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson lit cigarettes in the museum's restrooms (to the anger of museum donors, reportedly).\n\nDespite what Jason Derulo meme would have you believe, neither he nor anyone else fell down the stairs. But some guests grumbled that this year marks the tenth anniversary of the infamous elevator brawl between Jay-Z and Solange.\n\nOne last misstep? Wear the same outfit, of course. So that it makes reported While Wintour not only curates the guest list but also participates in their fashion choices, last year Olivia Wilde and Vogue China editor-in-chief Margaret Zhang showed up in the same Chlo violin dress in different combinations of colors. The couple took it in stride, sharing memes on social media about the accident. Great minds, Wilde wrote on Instagram.

The fashion world is converging on New York to get ready for one of its biggest nights -- the annual fundraising event in favor of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, famously organized by Vogue.\n\nAnd then there's everyone on social media, anxiously waiting to give their opinions on the looks sported by the many high-profile celebrities in attendance -- all while wearing their comfiest loungewear or pajamas, as one should for any and all big red carpet events -- and whether or not they have honored the year's theme.\n\nThe theme this year is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" to celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition of the same name, and the official dress code is \"The Garden of Time.\" So hopefully, stylists have managed to pull out every single striking archive piece they could get their hands on. And now that the anticipated strike announced by the union of Cond\u00e9 Nast workers has seemingly been averted with a tentative deal between representatives of the union and Cond\u00e9 Nast itself, everything seems to be ready to go.\n\nOnly two questions remain, really -- who are the celebrities attending? And among those celebrities, will there be any K-Pop idols like in the previous years? Let's see what info we have at the moment.\n\nAmong the most hotly rumored attendees are Ros\u00e9 and Jennie of BLACKPINK, one of the biggest girl groups in the entire K-Pop scene. Both idols have already made their Met Gala debut -- Ros\u00e9 in 2021, the first female idol to so do, and Jennie in 2023 -- and are pretty big ambassadors in the world of fashion, tied to the Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel brands respectively.\n\nIt only makes sense for fans to speculate that they're finally gonna walk up the Met steps in 2024, especially since they have been spotted in New York together. Then again, Ros\u00e9 did post a pretty cryptic Instagram story with the caption \"Bye NY, until next time\" on Sunday evening, so we'll just have to wait and see once the Met Gala actually starts.\n\nThere's a third BLACKPINK member currently stateside and that's the youngest of the group, the main dancer Lisa. She attended the Miami F1 Grand Prix on Sunday, so it's not a stretch to think she might make an appearance in New York this evening. She's also the ambassador of several high-end brands, particularly Celine, so her attendance would very much be justified.\n\nAll eight members of the boy group Stray Kids, one of the most famous currently active on the scene, could also be gearing up to attend this evening's fashion event. In an Instagram live recorded at the beginning of May, member Seungmin stated that the group was getting ready for it, going through several fittings and other preparations.\n\nJust like BLACKPINK, Stray Kids also has a place in the wider fashion industry. The entire group was the Asian ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger in 2023, and members Hyunjin and Felix were chosen as the global ambassador for Versace and the house ambassador for Louis Vuitton, respectively. We'll have to see if all the rumors are true and if the entire group will really make its Met Gala debut tonight.\n\nThere have been several other K-Pop idols who have attended the Met Gala over the years, ever since PSY became the very first South Korean singer to attend the event back in 2013 -- together with Super Junior's Siwon. The 2023 edition saw Jackson Wang of GOT7 among the attendees, alongside Jennie, while Johnny of NCT made his Met Gala debut in 2022 and the iconic soloist CL -- formerly of 2NE1 -- graced the steps of the Met back in 2021. Going even further back, EXO's Lay was in attendance in 2019 and soloist Rain made his appearance in 2015.\n\nI guess there's nothing else to do but see if any of them return to the Met Gala or if any new face will appear in this year's \"Garden of Time.\" I personally will be refreshing the hashtags over on X (formerly Twitter) as soon as the clock strikes 6 PM EST, the scheduled start time for the event.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedetta_geddo@themarysue.com", "name": "Benedetta Geddo", "type": "author",

It's about honoring clothes that are so fragile, they can never be worn again. Thus, these diaphanous fabrics and one-of-a-kind constructions are considered \"sleeping beauties\" in the archives of the museum.\n\nAs Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, told Vogue, \"It is very much an ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion.\"\n\nThe exhibition will also have three main zones that emphasize the Earth's elements: Land, Sea and Sky.\n\nThe fashion extravaganza has been inspired by everything from legendary designers to religion and futurism. But this year's Met Gala pays homage to the 1962 short story, \"The Garden of Time,\" written by author J.G. Ballard.\n\nThe book follows Count Axel and his wife, who listen to Mozart in their beautiful villa that's surrounded by a garden of crystal flowers. But outside their gilded cage, is an angry mob that nears their place of solitude. To keep the army at bay, Axel must turn back time by plucking his flowers, one by one, until there is nothing left.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" which plays off of J.G.'s short story title. While the theme can be interpreted in various ways, it's likely we'll see creations inspired by plants, flowers and other botanicals.\n\nFlorals? For spring? Why, yes, it will be groundbreaking at the Met Gala.\n\nAccording to the MET, the show will feature approximately 250 garments and accessories all connected visually through nature.\n\nSo, expect to be transported, as the exhibit includes several sensory capabilities, like smelling hats with floral notes or touching walls embossed with embroidered fabrics. And prepare to gaze upon the \"illusion technique known as Pepper's ghost,\" the museum website states, which will display how the \"hobble skirt\" restricted women's strides in the early 20th century.\n\nAll in all, the exhibit will span over 400 years of fashion history and showcase designs by Schiaparelli, Dior, Givenchy and others. And the pieces that are too fragile to ever be worn again -- such as a Charles Frederick Worth gown from 1877 -- will be viewed through \"animation, light projection, AI, CGI and other forms of sensory stimulation,\" the museum website reads.\n\n\"By appealing to the widest possible range of human senses,\" Andrew said in a press release, \"the show aims to reconnect with the works on display as they were originally intended -- with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Hollein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Hollein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

A parade of A-Listers dress according to the theme inspired by the Costume Institute's latest exhibition (some more than others) and walk the steps up to the museum before disappearing inside to enjoy the galleries, dinner and drinks.\n\nThe Met Gala is taking place on Monday night and it's time to place your bets: Which showstopping archival piece will Zendaya wear? Who will pull off the most uncanny stunt, topping Jared Leto's \"twin\" or Doja Cat's feline prosthetics? Inside, which celebs will flout the no-photos rule to sneak bathroom selfies? How late will Rihanna show up?\n\nThis year, the theme for the red carpet is \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing a 1962 short story of the same name by British author J.G. Ballard. Like the New Wave sci-fi story, which takes place in a garden of time-bending florals, the museum's exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" highlights connections between nature and technology, using AI, CGI and other tools to breathe new life into hundreds of fragile archival pieces spanning hundreds of years. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, curator-in-charge at the Costume Institute.\n\nExpect fantastical fashion with floral and sci-fi motifs on the red carpet, and stylists working with luxury houses to resurface famous older looks. The first celebrities to appear will be Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, the last of whom is making his Met Gala debut.\n\nA frenzy of A-List arrivals and photographs, the red carpet portion of the evening's proceedings last for a few hours, but that's the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and have a seated dinner. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has \"final say\" over every guest in attendance, the New York Times has previously reported.)\n\nThough the red-carpet and afterparties get the most attention of the night, the gala is above all, a fundraiser, whose five-figure tickets raise millions of dollars for the museum each year -- setting a record at nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the recently-released book \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nThe conceptual theme is expected to be a change of pace from last year, when the dress code was set to honor the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019. Over the decades, tributes to the legacies of individual designers have included Rei Kawakubo, Charles James, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace, with the last two scheduled shortly after the designers' untimely deaths.\n\nTo celebrate Lagerfeld, celebrities including Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman and Jenna Ortega flocked to the event in designs by Chanel, Fendi and Chlo\u00e9, where he left his indelible mark, but some paid a cheeky tribute to Lagerfeld's cat Choupette as well (hence Doja Cat's whiskered beauty look). Not all were pleased with the theme to honor the controversial designer, however, given his history of disparaging remarks about women's bodies and his refusal to champion more inclusive beauty standards.\n\nThe Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the nascent Costume Institute, organized by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet reportedly cost $50 each.\n\nOver the decades, the gala has transformed from an industry fete at off-site locations like Manhattan's Rainbow Room into an A-List phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute's major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the fashion world and New York society. Wintour, her successor, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, turning the gala into one of the most-watched events of the fashion calendar -- and the year. In 2023, the software company LaunchMetrics found that the Met Gala generated nearly double the \"media impact value\" for brands than the Super Bowl, at $995 million.\n\nThe first theme was \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, tied to a retrospective of the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga; the event was attended by guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to \"Fashion's Big Night Out.\"\n\nEarly themes included \"Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,\" \"The Glory of Russian Costume,\" and \"The 18th-Century Woman.\" But gala-goers mostly kept to conventional eveningwear until the 2000s, when some guests began to have more fun with the themes -- and the internet allowed more eyes on the arrivals. The most memorable themes from the past decade have included \"China: Through the Looking Glass,\" \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and the divisive \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" thanks to celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners, who use the red carpet to put on a show.\n\nEach year rumors fly about who may be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to any offense towards the event or Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor has only explicitly spoken about one guest she would \"never invite back\" in public -- Donald Trump, whom she mentioned on James Corden's late night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names.\n\nOther previous guests have sworn it off, however, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after she made an appearance at the event, Fey said on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that the gala is a \"jerk parade.\"\n\n\"If you had a million arms, all the people you would want to punch in the whole world -- they're all there,\" she said. \"I mean I was there, clearly I was one of them.\"\n\nSome celebrities backtrack, however. Gwyneth Paltrow famously called the Met Gala \"un-fun\" in 2013 and said she'd \"never\" go again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019).\n\nMet Gala guests have often broken the no-social-media rule to give a more candid glimpse of who is hanging with who and what goes on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson lit up cigarettes in the museum bathroom (to the ire of the museum's donors, reportedly).\n\nDespite what the Jason Derulo meme would have you believe, he -- nor anyone else -- has taken a tumble down the stairs. But some guests have famously rumbled -- this year marks ten years since the infamous after-party elevator fight between Jay-Z and Solange.\n\nA final faux pas? Wearing the same outfit, of course. While it's been reported that Wintour not only arranges the guest list but also has a hand in their fashion choices, last year, Olivia Wilde and departing \"Vogue China\" editor Margaret Zhang showed up in the same throwback Chlo\u00e9 violin dress in different color schemes. The pair took it in stride, sharing memes on social media about the accident. \"Great minds,\" Wilde wrote on Instagram. \"If you're gonna twin with anyone, make it @margaretzhang.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

While we won't be surprised if someone makes a Sleeping Beauty reference, we can also expect the participating designers to get playful with the concept, as we've seen in years past.\n\nThe celebrity co-chairs for the 2024 gala are Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny, who will all surely make a statement when they arrive to the Met steps.

That's a whole different ballgame.\n\nA far cry from your average event, the Gala calls for hair, makeup, theatrics, optics and much, much more. It's not enough to arrive in a dress, every single detail, right down to the last thread has to be carefully thought out, which can take months, if not the entire year, to plan.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what exactly goes into Met Gala prep, read on to discover how stars get ready for the big night.\n\nFrom LED therapy to intense facials, celebrities spare no expense on their skin in the leadup to the Met. Preparation actually starts months before the big night, with many keeping their skin specialists on speed dial to ensure a clear, glowing complexion.\n\nIv\u00e1n Pol is said skin specialist for many A-listers, including Kate Hudson, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Karlie Kloss who all attend his exclusive skin spa prior to hitting the red carpet. His signature treatment, known as 'The Beauty Sandwich', is known for smoothing skin texture and helping with wrinkle reduction and tightening. Using radio frequency, the treatment provides a much-needed refreshing to have skin shimmering before stepping in front of the cameras.\n\nHailey Bieber is a fan of Dr. Barbara Sturm's Instant Glow Facial, which is said to include 'cleansing, exfoliation, extraction and a lymphatic and firming massage.\n\nWinnie Harlow and Adut Akech have both paid visits to Soma Spa to receive the 24k Gold Facial & Oxygen HydraFacial which promises to suck impurities from the skin while locking in moisture.\n\nCelebrity facialist Joanna Vargas has hosted the likes of Lili Reinhart and Constance Wu, who opted for the Supernova Facial and Triple Crown Facial -- a hydrating, exfoliating treatment offering microdermabrasion, face contouring and hydration.\n\nAccording to celebrity stylist, Jordan Foster, who has worked on several Met Galas (including Ashley Graham's 2019 look), says that outfit preparation starts well in advance of the event itself.\n\n\"The ideal preparation for the Met Gala starts weeks, if not months, before the event. However, as everyone knows, Anna Wintour approves each guest and often who they are attending with. This decision sometimes isn't made until much closer to the event, which means time to scramble and figure it out. Even when you have weeks to plan, things still usually come together at the last minute in the days leading up to the Met Gala and you're usually still perfecting things as the celebrity is getting out of the car to walk the red carpet. It's like the Oscars times 100,\" she told ELLE Australia.\n\nAs for how involved each celebrity is in their final look, it comes down to personal choice, but they put a lot of trust in their stylist.\n\n\"A celebrity can be as involved or uninvolved as they want in choosing and designing their Met Gala looks,\" Jordan explained. \"Celebrities, for the most part though, hire stylists to spearhead the project and put their trust in them. It's usually the stylist who is liaising with the designer or brands and guiding the client through the process. If a celebrity is attending with a designer and that designer is making them a custom look, then generally that designer will have a vision and you trust them on it. The stylist can make tweaks and usually accessorise as they see fit. It's a true collaborative effort. Just as with any other event, celebrities just want to look their best, feel their best, and hopefully have a look that is loved by all!\"\n\n\"It's definitely important for celebrities to stick to the theme in my opinion. Sometimes the theme can be more challenging in terms of interpretation and in those cases you at the very least give a nod to the theme with hair/makeup or accessories,\" stylist Jordan Foster added.\n\n\"In my experience, I've never had a theme completely dictate the look except for in 2019 when I styled Ashley Graham who wore a custom Dapper Dan look and attended with him. We really went with the theme in every way possible for that look. The theme should be respected though in my opinion. Hundreds of people work on the Met Gala and a lot of thought goes into the theme and the exhibition that is part of it. People often forget the Gala is a charity event to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum which is home to the yearly fashion exhibition the theme of the gala is tied to. \"\n\n\"Preparation for the Met Gala on the day of starts in the morning and a 16 hour day can go by in what feels like one hour,\" Jordan explained. \"Don't forget that celebrities also attend after parties and the looks for that are just as important to the team. So you are prepping for two looks, not just one.\n\n\"Often a celebrity is borrowing jewellery worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars and those pieces cannot be borrowed any longer than the event itself. Last minute decisions on shoes and bag are often left to the day of as well. Hair and makeup begins in the early afternoon and any last minute alterations are being done the same day. In 2019, for Ashley Graham's Met Gala look we had someone gluing rhinestones to her tights and gloves and another person sewing her into her dress literally as she was trying to walk out the door. The day is complete chaos but it's so fun and so incredibly satisfying when you see the celebrity walking the red carpet.\"\n\nMost artists will create a mood board which they'll go over with their celebrity, working together to create a look that they're both happy with. On the night, depending on how intense the end result is, it can take anywhere between 1-3 hours to create the finished look. Beauty is usually a secondary feature to the fashion, which is arguably the main event, but sometimes hair and makeup has the ability to steal the show -- it just depends what look they're going for.\n\nMany celebrities have a go-to stylist whom they trust, and they're understandably the go-to for Met Gala looks.

Remember, she looked like Cinderella!\n\nThough Zendaya has attended the Met Gala five times over her career, she has never been to the event with her longtime boyfriend, Tom Holland.\n\nActually, Tom Holland has never been to the Met Gala ever! So, seeing as his girlfriend is hosting, 2024 would seem like the perfect time for him to make his debut.\n\nExcept it's very unlikely it will happen. Don't worry, it's not because they've broken up.\n\nYou see, the Met Gala always takes place on the first Monday in May. In 2024, that means Monday May 6.\n\nStarting this spring, Tom Holland will star as Romeo in Jamie Lloyd's new production of Romeo and Juliet at the Duke of York's Theatre in London.\n\nTickets for the production sold out within minutes, as fans are dying to see Tom act up close and in person.\n\nThe production runs from May 11 to August 3, meaning his opening night is 5 days before the Met Gala.\n\nNow, is it physically possible for him to do both?

Ballard's 1962 short story) before attending the \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibit.

The theme for this year is 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion'. With approximately 250 rare items from the permanent collection on display, this year's event promises to be a visual feast for fashion enthusiasts.\n\nReportedly, Hollywood royalties including Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and Chris Hemsworth will lead the charge as co-chairs, ensuring the red carpet shines as bright as ever. While the excitement builds for this star-studded affair, there's one rule attendees must adhere to: No mobile phones allowed inside.\n\nBut why the ban on phones at the Met Gala? The answer lies in a 2015 decision aimed at curbing excessive social media use during the event. A notice sent to all guests made it clear: \"The use of phones for photography and social media will not be permitted inside the gala.\" This rule was enforced to maintain the event's exclusivity. However, it has seen its fair share of flouting, with Kylie Jenner sneaking in a bathroom selfie back in 2017.\n\nHowever, phone restrictions aren't the only rules guests must follow to stay in the good graces of Vogue's Anna Wintour. Entry is restricted to those below 18 years of age, smoking is a no-go inside the museum, and food items featuring onion, garlic, or parsley are off the menu. Seating arrangements are also strictly enforced to ensure the night runs smoothly.\n\nAs celebrities from the world of film, fashion, music, sports, social media, and politics ascend the iconic steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they'll be embracing the theme, 'The Garden of Time' for the evening's dress code.

The event will also kick off the latest costume exhibition titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" with \"The Garden of Time\" as the dress code.\n\nThe institute was renovated in 2014 as the Anna Wintour Costume Center with the help of the Vogue editor-in-chief whose name is at its doors. A trustee of the Met, Wintour has spent decades growing the gala into what the museum calls one of the \"most visible and successful charity events in the world.\"\n\n\"It was a society event. People weren't very excited about going to it,\" Wintour recounted to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in 2023. \"To take it over and try to make a night out of it was quite intimidating.\"\n\nThe Met Gala is a fundraiser that brings together some of the biggest names in the most famed industries. Guests flock to New York City on the first Monday in May to show off collaborations with famous designers and brands on looks that take months to make.\n\n\"The Met Gala, it has always had one mission, and that is to raise money for the important work,\" Wintour said.\n\nGuests follow a yearly theme and work to reference historic garments, incorporate innovative ideas and execute intricate concepts that resonate beyond the walls of the Met.\n\n\"We are always interested in trying to reflect a cultural moment and what we feel is happening at the world in any given time,\" Wintour said about the invitees.\n\n\"Every year is different and we try and curate the guest list in a way that makes sense for whatever the theme of the exhibition is,\" Wintour said.\n\nIt's been the setting of notable and much-discussed pop culture highlights, from Rihanna's 2015 arrival in a lengthy Chinese cape, to Lady Gaga's multi-faceted reveals at the 2019 Camp-themed gala. Within the last decade, fashion nerds, critics and consumers review the red carpet with keen precision to understand, through photos and videos, the efforts -- and at times, mistakes -- that go into preparing for the event.\n\nThough many have walked the steps into the museum and visited its exhibits, very few have done so wearing the finest pieces to party and spend thousands (sometimes millions) among titans in film, sports, business, music and society. That rarified allure is what draws many to follow and dissect the gala.\n\nHanan Besovic, the post-pandemic viral voice behind Instagram's @ideservecouture, will have a seat adjacent to the action. He will join a handful of influencers at the Mark Hotel -- where many gala-goers prep and primp for the event -- on the day of the gala in the Upper East Side, five blocks from the Met.\n\nThere, Besovic will watch the arrivals and make social content alongside a room of other fashion-obsessed creators hosted by Meta.\n\nAs the hotel's guests exit their temporary lair at the Mark after spending hours on hair, makeup and styling, they exit to a crowd of fans and press awaiting a first glimpse of their attire, before it's time to line up by the museum's steps.\n\n\"Everybody has one minute of our attention and then there's the next person,\" Besovic said.\n\nUsually, the first to show up are the event chairs. This year Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Lopez co-chair with Anna Wintour.\n\nOne by one, celebrities are carefully shuffled through the carpeted steps of the Met, where thousands of global outlets standby to photograph and record every angle. The seamless choreography is seen by what Vogue says is millions via its viral streams.\n\nWhat happens next is what fuels the most intrigue. In a vast contrast to what goes on outside, most of what occurs inside of the Met is not recorded.\n\n\"Those tickets are crazy expensive. The brands buy out tables,\" Besovic said.\n\nIt's widely known the night includes a dinner and a performance. Cher, Rihanna, Madonna and Lady Gaga have performed in years past, among the world's most coveted art and notable artists.\n\nVogue is usually the only publication with the inside scoop. In 2023, they previewed the gala's dinner portion, guided by what they say was one of Karl Lagerfeld's most famous gatherings: Paloma Picasso's wedding reception.\n\nThose dishes look dainty, colorful and healthy in Vogue's images, featuring chilled spring pea soup and \u014cra King salmon served on vintage plates with an assortment of fruit and vegetables for last year's attendees.\n\n\"The only snippets that we get are from social media,\" Besovic says about the event's exclusivity.\n\nViral bathroom videos and selfies taken by celebrities are the only view inside. Katie Perry rushing back into her campy burger outfit for the 2019 gala after running into Jennifer Lopez near the stalls. The Kardashians posing with Paris Jackson and a gaggle of supermodels. Lil Nas X, Erykah Badu and Jack Harlow posing for a picture. Or, celebs post elevator videos, such as the viral moment with Reese Witherspoon chatting with Cara Delevingne, Zooey Deschanel and Kate Upton. These end up being the only glimpses inside the gala to scroll through before common folk hit the hay.\n\nAs the gala ends, guests rush to the after-parties, many of whom bounce around New York City all night long. The Standard Hotel's \"Boom Boom Room\" usually hosts A-listers -- in 2023, singer and actress Janelle Mon\u00e1e was at the helm, according to Women's Wear Daily.\n\nBrands and designers also unleash more fashion moments during the after-parties.\n\nIn 2016, when model Karlie Kloss hit the town after the gala, American designer Brandon Maxwell adapted her outfit for the \"afters\" by cutting her structured gown into a mini. This year, designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Shayne Oliver will debut a capsule collection, featuring about 50 pieces in the collaboration.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news",

And you can bet that Kim Kardashian is going to be there, bringing the drama as per usual.\n\nKardashian has been attending, and turning heads, at the Met Gala since 2013, and each of her looks has made an imprint on my brain forever. From couch-like floral prints to latex sparklers, you can always count on the SKIMS mogul to get people talking.\n\nHer most recent appearances, however, have been the most controversial of all. ICYMI, Kardashian's 2022 dress went down in Met Gala infamy after she revived an archival Marilyn Monroe gown. The sequin-covered stunner sparked controversy, as many initially thought she damaged it at the event.\n\nThe following year, she traded sequins for pearls in a dramatic number that featured nearly 70,000 of the precious beads. The look inadvertently paid homage to her first Playboy magazine shoot -- another iconic throwback moment.\n\nThis year's Met Gala -- taking place on Monday, May 6 -- asks that guests come dressed for the theme \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" While the motif seems up for interpretation, Kardashian definitely knows how to \"awaken\" fashion -- or at least get the fashion group chats buzzing.\n\nWhile we wait with bated breath to see how Kim Kardashian will take on this theme, let's take a look back at her best outfits over the years.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allie_fasanella@bustle.com", "name": "Allie Fasanella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alyssa_lapid@bustle.com", "name": "Alyssa Lapid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Monroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homage (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motif (visual arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Women's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Women's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Fashion", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Advice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2023/4/10/36c9b3cb-a453-4fe4-ab77-e26bed195e96-getty-168194014.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.5347&fp-y=0.2541", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1057, "textEnd": 1062}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

(Exclusive)", "body": "Speaking with PEOPLE the morning of the 2024 Met Gala, the 'Outer Banks' star also teases what fans can expect from the couple's debut looks\n\nScoring an exclusive invite to the Met Gala is a rite of passage for many stars. The Super Bowl of style hosts the hottest celebrities from across all industries, and many spend months planning what they will wear for their moment in the spotlight on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's iconic steps.\n\nWhen actor Chase Stokes found out he was going to be on this year's exclusive guest list, he was on a wholesome date with his girlfriend, country star Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n\"This is actually a crazy story,\" the Outer Banks star, 31, tells PEOPLE exclusively ahead of his big debut at the 2024 Met Gala on May 6.\n\n\"I had just flown from Morocco to Atlanta to do re-shoots for a movie with Netflix. It was a 26-hour travel day. I worked all day and then I had the next morning to do something. I was on the way to the aquarium with my girlfriend and we got the call. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're going to the Met.'\"\n\nHe adds that receiving the news was a \"very wild moment, but nonetheless, one that I will never, ever forget.\"\n\nRelated: 'Sleeping Beauties': The 2024 Met Gala Theme Explained -- and How Stars Will Interpret the Dress Code\n\nSpeaking of the \"Heartfirst\" singer, Stokes says he and Ballerini, who confirmed her Met Gala debut on Instagram Monday morning, have \"f--king awesome looks\" that are \"very individual,\" represent both their personalities and overall mesh well together. \"I think what we like to do is just complement versus coordinate,\" he says.\n\nAs for his look, Stokes can't say too much before the red carpet reveal, which he's doing in partnership with Motorola and its Flip the Script campaign.\n\nHowever, he does tell PEOPLE that he will be wearing Michael Kors. \"We had our final fitting last night. We hung out with Michael for a little while,\" Stokes says of spending time with the legendary designer.\n\nThis year's Met Gala dress code is \"The Garden of Time\" while the theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nRelated: The Best Met Gala Looks of All Time\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nStokes admits that he's a tad \"nervous\" about the night ahead, but he's keeping an open mind going in. \"It's one of those events where you just got to let the night take it and run with it. There's just this inevitability to it. I'm staying open and trying to see where it's going to go.\"\n\nFor the rest of the day, Stokes is making sure he has a \"good vibe\" going on. He's prepping with \"style tips, good music, good people and good experiences\" -- and lots of SZA's songs on his getting-ready playlist. (P.S. Stokes says if ever runs into the \"Snooze\" singer, he promises he'll have a major fan moment. \"If I pass out and you hear that, just know, that's real.\")", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Banks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outer Banks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Stokes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsea_Ballerini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsea Ballerini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rite of passage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartfirst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heartfirst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SZA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SZA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kors", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Kors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wLhDywmNols36ceaEF3p.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/9f85f7e6d86be5bca3ece605fd9dd3f5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 743, "textEnd": 748}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe Met Gala is \"fashion's biggest night out\" and Hollywood's greatest excuse to dress completely out of the ordinary. Standard accessories include floating heads, green babies, capes, and canes, while furry catsuits, spikey head wraps, and stiff sculpture-esque garments are the norm. Year after year, a look book of bizarre glamour unfolds on the red carpet between spurts of simple tuxedos and clean-cut gowns.\n\nHonouring the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, the event is, of course, a display of opulence, gathering A-list elite and offering coveted invitations with a $50,000 price tag. But unlike the average black-tie gala, costumes and chaos are expected on the first Monday in May as the fashion emulates components of a brand-new spring exhibit - at least it's supposed to. In other words, a healthy serving of whimsical elegance is warranted so long as it is understood to be on theme and within dress code. But as the years have gone by, it's become overtly noticeable just how many attendees show up in void looks, making little attempts to dress in accordance with the motif.\n\nThis year, an ode to fashion's \"sleeping beauties\" will be paid with over 250 archive pieces, some dating back 400 years to the Elizabethan period, on display and reimagined through CGI, soundscaping, light projection, illusion techniques, and video animation. \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" will drive attention to the structural concepts of fragile pieces, emboldening the fragmented garments categorised under three main natural elements - land, sea, and sky.\n\nAccording to Vogue, invitees are meant to follow the dress code, \"The Garden of Time\" - telling the story of Count Axel, his countess, and their dwindling garden. From this, guests should know to represent fleeting beauty and refrain from wearing princess dress or pajama sets.\n\nUnfortunately, there'll likely be one (usually more than one) that'll ignore the memo and go rogue, donning a designer piece so far from the intention that it's pointless to even question their thought process.\n\nAs we ready ourselves to watch creativity and absurdity simultaneously spill out on the red carpet, speculation over who'll fall short of the mark swirls. Though the argument that every celebrity look worn to the Met Gala is subjected to criticisms and contrasting opinions, some've come out over the last 25 years that were undeniably a point of contention.\n\nHere are the most controversial and off-theme looks worn to the Met Gala over the years.\n\nKim Kardashian - 2022\n\nFor the 2022 Met Gala, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" guests were meant to pay homage to the gilded age. Finding inspiration in old Hollywood, Kim took a cue from icon Marilyn Monroe, donning the exact dress she wore when she sang \"Happy Birthday Mr President\" to John F Kennedy. The delicate nude gown, embelished with tiny jewels, had been on display inside Ripley's Believe It Or not in Orlando, Florida.\n\nKim plucked the token garmet and wore it to walk up the Met steps, prompting immediate controversy. People were angered by the Skims creator's decision to wear the actual dress, a piece that was already so fragile. Some claimed she tore the back of the dress until Ripley's confirmed the garment wasn't at all damaged.\n\nDoja Cat - 2023\n\nThe 2023 theme \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" sparked criticisms as soon as it was announced. A testament to the Chanel designer was disputed due to the sheer number of crude comments and conservative views Lagerfeld offered throughout his career. Doja Cat was one of the handful of celebrities who honoured Lagerfeld with a nod to his Birman cat, Choupette.\n\nThe \"Say So\" artist dressed in a custom Oscar de la Renta gown with more than 350,000 hand-embroidered silver beads. The dress had a hood and cat-like ears to match her makeup prosethetics designed to resemble Lagerfeld's furry friend. Not only did Doja Cat dress the part, she acted like a cat too, meowing instead of talking. Some viewers were put off by this entire facade, labelling it as the \"worst\" of the night.\n\nKylie Jenner - 2022\n\nJust six months after Off-White's creative director and founder Virgil Abloh suddenly passed away, Kylie Jenner honoured her close friend at the 2022 Met Gala. The dress code was \"Gilded Glamour,\" and the Sprinter founder wore the fall/winter 2022 finale Off-White couture wedding gown completed with an attached short sleeve T-shirt and a backward baseball hat fashioned on top of a veil.\n\nWhile Kylie's intention was to pay tribute to Abloh, wearing a design from his final collection, many questioned her for wearing the frilly-bottom gown. More specifically, critics were angered that she seemed to ignore the theme entirely knowing she could get away with it and still get invited back the next year.\n\nTaylor Swift - 2016\n\nThe Midnights performer has been criticised for her style choice on and off the red carpet for years. One of her most questionable ensembles, the custom Louis Vuitton dress for the 2016 Met Gala, majorly struck a cord with passionate fashion fans. For the \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\" theme, Swift tapped the French fashion house. The concept was centered around innovation, focusing on the future of the digital age and how it intersected with clothing design.\n\nSwift opted for an intergalactic metallic, three-tiered frill dress with leather wrap pumps. She decorated the look with a brand new bleach bob and purple lipstick. This would be a marker for the beginning of her Reputation era, and it wasn't well-received, with many divided on her \"Bleachella\" red carpet moment.\n\nFrank Ocean - 2021\n\nThe \"Ivy\" singer's 2021 Met Gala outfit has been deemed one of the most outrageous in the event's history. Ocean was accompanied by an unusual and unexpected accesory for the \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" exhibit - a plastic neon green baby. His outfit was quite simple and understated, donning a black Prada suit and vest with a plain white shirt peaking out from underneath. However, Ocean channelled a whimisical nature by bringing a doll to match his green hair. With a theme that elicited expressions to American fashion, the artist's response was largely misunderstood.\n\nAmy Schumer - 2022\n\nOn the night meant to honour the beauty of fashion through the golden age in America, the comedian donned a conservative, all-black coat dress by Gabriela Hearst. While others dazzled in sparkly garments reminscent of classic cinema and old Manhattan, Schumer looked like she was protesting the dress code choosing a dark monochromatic outfit. Fans bashed the celebrity's look online, arguing she appeared like she was attending a \"funeral\" in the double-breasted jacket.\n\nKaty Perry - 2010\n\nThe 2010 Met Gala, \"American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity,\" celebrated a cultural shift in the country at the start of a new decade. Most attendees showed national spirit in red, white, and blue, but the \"Roar\" singer went off in a different direction. The vibrant artist chose to wear a multi-colour LED strapless gown designed by Cute Circuit with a geometric pink crystal statement necklace. Her motivation was to represent fearless women with the astonishing glow-up garment. However, critics claimed her look was too loosely connected to the theme.\n\nDan Levy - 2021\n\nThe Schitt's Creek star may not have upset the masses with a plastic baby accessory, but the TV actor wasn't a favourite from the 2021 Met Gala either. Levy stepped onto the cream-coloured carpet in a Jonathan Anderson original. He embodied the globe, donning ballooned puffer sleeps, a polo shirt with an embroidered queer couple kissing in the centre, and grid leggings. The ensemble was finished with what could only be described as \"Jane Birkini-fyed\" double buckle combat boots and a piece of literature in hand. Levy's look, bedazzled with Cartier diamonds, was an ode to the LGBTQ+ community in America. The powerful message spewed on the carpet in blue, green, and pink hues.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker - 2016\n\nAs Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker usually got away with wearing almost anything (emphasis on the almost). She's a model for fashion risk-takers in television and on the street, in and out of character. But Parker seemingly misinterpreted the dress code for the 2016 Met Gala, \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\".\n\nHer take on the digital age in white capris, a matching corset, and double-breasted gold button military jacket with pleated chiffon sleeve cuffs didn't translate. The entire look, an ode toHamilton, was by Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia. Their idea played on innovation in a non-technical sense: thought and fabrication. Parker decorated the all-white ensemble with a large gold pendant necklace and blue pumps that could've been easily mistaken for the cherised blue Manolos she wears to her courthouse wedding with Mr Big in SATC.\n\nJared Leto - 2022\n\nEvidently, every celebrity at the 2022 Met Gala had a different interpretation of oppulence in the golden age. The 52-year-old musician saw a double entendre in gilded glamour. Leto showed up to the Metropolitan Museum in a get-up that excited and upset viewers all at once. He wore a tweed tuxedo with stitched flower bouquets, pink bow ties, studded hair broach, dark shades, and a red clutch with a gold metal clasp. Next to him was no plastic accessory but a real life copy. Leto brought Gucci's then creative director, Alessandro Michele, as his twin for the night.

During her conversation with Jenna Bush Hager, Wintour explained the complications with the theme of the 2024 event, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and the inspiration behind its dress code, \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,\" she said. \"When we came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties,' it's wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.\"\n\nThe editor-in-chief of Vogue recalled that when establishing the theme, she turned to curator in charge of The Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton, for advice on what celebrities could wear. She also acknowledged that amid those conversations about outfits, the public was then confused about that dress code.\n\n\"I said, 'What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?' And he said, 'Well, what about 'Garden of Time?'\" she explained. \"So, I fear that we've unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologise.\"\n\nShe then shared how she believes people will follow the dress code at the gala, adding: \"I imagine we'll see a lot of flowers.\" When Bush Hager asked her if she'd be wearing flowers, Wintour simply responded: \"Possibly.\"\n\nDuring her conversation with Bush Hager, the 74-year-old editor further detailed the theme of the event, infamously held the first Monday in May, which this year falls on 6 May.\n\nIn November, Vogue first announced the theme of The Costume Institute's 2024 exhibition as \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The reveal was met with a myriad of confused individuals online, predicting a display of designer jammies on the red carpet for the famed opening as well as a parade of princesses on the museum steps thinking \"Sleeping Beauties\" was a reference to the classic Disney animation. Yet, neither are correct.\n\nAccording to Bolton, the entire exhibit is centered around 50 historical garments, latent and so fragile they can never be worn again - the \"sleeping beauties\" of the exhibit. The main motivating piece was a Charles Frederick Worth original, an 1877 silk satin ball gown. Each delicate piece, some no longer in their true form, will be reimagined inside innovative casings made to bring the garments back to life.\n\n\"The idea of 'Sleeping Beauties' is taking these masterpieces from different periods, and because so many of them are very fragile, they are laid flat behind glass walls,\" Wintour said.\n\nRegarding what to wear, Met Gala guests must follow a dress code that resembles fleeting beauty. Of course, attendees can embrace the obvious by wearing florals -- or even real life flowers -- to represent an actual garden. For this option, Vogue recommended looking at the \"Sleeping Beauties\" exhibition itself, which has a black evening coat by Charles Frederick Worth from 1889 on display. Another motif in the Met Gala's \"The Garden of Time\" dress code is time, or the passing of it. Attendees could consider wearing items featuring clocks, such as Moschino's grandfather clock gown from Fall 2022.\n\nThe co-chairs for tonight's fashion extravaganza include Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny, while Vogue's red-carpet hosts will be La La Anthony, Gwendoline Christie, and Ashley Graham, alongside special correspondent Emma Chamberlain. Additionally, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, Cara Delevingne, and Olivia Rodrigo are rumoured to be at the gala, according to a 13 April Page Six report.", "source":

(The showing will include approximately 250 garments and accessories spanning over four centuries -- including archival pieces by Dior, Givenchy, Schiaparelli, and Saint Laurent.) After telling Vogue in April that she was \"still deciding\" on her look this year, Lopez -- who has attended the Met more than a dozen times -- dished about tonight's outfit on Good Morning America earlier today.\n\n\"You'll have to tune in to see,\" Lopez coyly said of her ensemble. \"But it's exciting, it's exciting. It's a fun night for fashion.\" Host Lara Spencer then asked Lopez if she'll \"be able to walk in your look,\" to which Lopez responded \"Barely, ever. The Met Gala looks are not about comfort.\"\n\nLopez said of co-chairing the event that \"I was really honored to be asked to host it alongside Zendaya and Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth,\" she said. \"Anna was gracious enough to ask me. We're going to have a good time.\" She added of the event that \"It's always a nice time there. It's such an interesting mix of artists and businesspeople. It's not just music or film, it's everybody -- fashion, film, music, business -- and you get to have some really interesting interactions.\"\n\nLast year, Lopez wore a Ralph Lauren midriff-baring halter gown and pink satin skirt; no word yet on who is dressing her tonight. \"I'm also one of those people who chooses at the last minute,\" she told Vogue last month. \"Like, I like choices, and then I go, 'Okay, this is how I feel today.'

The Met Gala, renowned as the pinnacle of fashion events, annually brings together the creme de la creme of the entertainment, fashion, and art worlds under one roof. With each iteration, the Gala encapsulates a theme that serves as a canvas for designers and attendees to unleash their sartorial imagination. That being said, a certain chunk of celebs have been banned from entering the elite premises, while others have shared their resentment openly. Here's a list of celebs who have been cancelled or simply won't show up.\n\nThe former US president was a frequent at the Met Gala. It was also where he proposed to his wife Melania Trump. However, when Anna Wintour appeared on The Late Show with James Corden, she confirmed that she would never invite Trump to the event again, confirming that he was banned for real.\n\nTim Gunn\n\nAuthor and fashion presenter Tim Gunn confirmed that he was banned in a 2016 interview with E! Entertainment's Fashion Police. He said, \"I was asked what is the most unforgettable thing I've ever seen in fashion and I said, 'It's easy. It was watching Anna Wintour being carried down five flights of stairs by two bodyguards -- two big hulking men -- from a fashion show.' All hell broke loose. It was insane. We've had an open war ever since.\"\n\nAmerican actor Lili Reinhart, known for portraying Betty Cooper in the series 'Riverdale' has been vocal about promoting body positivity. She missed the invitation to the 2023 Met Gala despite attending it in 2018, 2019, and 2021. This was because she slammed Kim Kardashian's extreme diet to fit into Marilyn Monroe's gown which the reality TV star wore in 2022.\n\nJosh Hartnett\n\n'Pearl Harbour' actor Josh Hartnett was rejected from the event for being irrelevant. A 2016 documentary featuring behind the scenes of the Met showed Calvin Klein asking to dress Josh and having him on his table, a Vogue employee was heard remarking, \"What has he done lately? Nothing. You guys are all set.\"\n\nFormer One Direction star Zayn Malik attended the Met in 2016 with his then-girlfriend Gigi Hadid. Two years later when he was asked if he'd make an appearance again, Zayn told GQ, \"Now it's not something I would go to, I'd rather be sitting at my house doing something productive than dressing up in really expensive clothes and being photographed on a red carpet...to do the self-indulgent 'look at me, I'm amazing' thing on the red carpet, it's not me.\"\n\nAmy Schumer\n\nActor-comedian Amy Schumer may have not been banned but she was very opinionated on what she thought of the fashion extravaganza. In an interview with Howard Stern in 2016, she said, \"It's people doing an impression of having a conversation. I don't like the farce...We're dressed up like a bunch of f***ing assholes. I don't like it. I have no interest in fashion...I don't care.\"\n\nSinger Demi Lovato who went to the Met Gala in 2016 spoke about the experience two years later in an interview with Billboard. They said, \"I had a terrible experience. This one celebrity was a complete bitch and was miserable to be around. It was very cliquey. I remember being so uncomfortable that I wanted to drink.\"", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Gunn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Gunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hartnett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hartnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_positivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body positivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayn_Malik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zayn Malik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Late Show with David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marilyn Monroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Corden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Corden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lili Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gigi Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Lovato", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demi Lovato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Klein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Klein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Direction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/celebsbannedmet_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Etienne Haro, general manager of The Mark, tells PEOPLE exclusively that they're expecting around 60 celebrity guests on May 6 in addition to their respective talent and glam teams. Previous guests on Met Gala day include Cardi B, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade and Gigi Hadid.\n\n\"The Mark is booked out well ahead of Met Gala day,\" he says, noting that the hotel's sales team starts \"receiving enquiries from the moment the annual theme is revealed.\" (The Met Gala's theme for 2024, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" was announced back in November 2023.)\n\nRelated: All About the 2024 Met Gala, from the Co-Chairs to the Theme\n\nThe sixteen-story building offers 106 rooms, 46 suites and 1 penthouse suite -- but among the busiest quarters of the nearly-century old hotel is its striking lobby, particularly in the hours leading up to the fashion f\u00eate.\n\n\"The energy on the day is incredible. It goes crescendo starting with the positioning of the red carpet early in the morning, followed by the delivery of the flowers and the arrival of the glam squads,\" Haro says. \"As the day progresses, the intensity is palpable.\"\n\nBeing fashionably late the ball is simply not an option for the Met Gala, which explains why Haro says \"there is a real sense of urgency\" up until the stars' head on their way. \"Minutes before the first departure, the lobby suddenly clears. What follows is two hours of the most incredible display of fashion.\"\n\nHaro adds: \"The Met Gala's reputation as 'fashion's biggest night' is certainly not an overstatement -- and nor is ours, as 'the starriest hotel lobby in the world.'\"\n\nRead on for everything to know about The Mark ahead of the highly-anticipated sartorial scene.\n\nBuilt in 1926, The Mark was designed in a neo-Italian Renaissance-style and erected by architects Schwartz & Gross. The landmark building blends modern luxury with quintessential charm of old New York.\n\nThe hotel is located at 25 East 77th Street, on the corner of 77th Street and Madison Avenue on New York's Upper East Side. Its neighborhood is perfectly situated near Manhattan hotspots, including the \"The Met\" and Central Park. Plus, a number of art galleries, restaurants and high-end shops are in the vicinity.\n\nRelated: Gabrielle Union Is Saving Her Met Gala Outfits for Kaavia So She'll Have a 'Little Bit of Her Mom' (Exclusive)\n\nCelebrities grace The Mark red carpet prior to hitting the Met Gala's covered steps, a tradition that began when the hotel reopened in 2009. It serves as the ultimate sartorial send off of stars following their anticipated outfit reveals.\n\nHaro tells PEOPLE the \"natural light, elegance, comfort, privacy and ultra-personalized service\" of The Mark are \"key attributes\" that celebrities and their glam teams enjoy as they prepare for the big night. Plus, he says guests can \"rest, dress and celebrate all in the same space.\"\n\nSnagging an invite to the Met Gala is hard, but booking a room on Met Gala day is equally exclusive! Haro says the hotel is \"booked out well ahead\" of the ball, with inquiries starting when the \"theme is revealed\" and the \"first guests receive confirmation of their attendance.\"\n\nThe Mark's interior houses 106 rooms and 46 suites. \"We host about 60 celebrity guests over the period,\" Haro tells PEOPLE, noting that the \"the finest talents of the fashion world\" including designers, make-up artists, facialists, jewelers and more also fill up the space.\n\n\"The 153 rooms at The Mark are a rare commodity on Met Gala day,\" Haro says. Fortunately, he praises the sales team's \"tremendous job\" throughout the booking process to understand their guests' needs and requirements ahead of the rush to \"avoid disappointment.\"\n\nParisian interior designer Jacques Grange is the mastermind behind The Mark's sophisticated, yet vibrant inside. The mesmerizing black and white striped floors synonymous with the hotel were conceived by the French visionary, who's portfolio of clients includes everyone from late fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent to the Princess of Monaco.\n\nIn addition to its 106 rooms and 46 suites, The Mark houses 1 penthouse suite. In fact, it's the largest penthouse in the United States at more than 10,000 square feet including 2,500 square feet of rooftop terrace overlooking Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and breathtaking cityscape.\n\n\"The Mark Penthouse is nothing short of spectacular!\" says Haro, noting its five-bedroom suite over two floors and panoramic views over N.Y.C. \"It is a highly coveted accommodation on Met Gala [Monday], and one of the first suites we book each year.\"\n\nHaro was tight lipped on some of the starriest celebrities who have stayed in the penthouse suite, though he revealed, \"The booker has actually been the same for the past few years and it is the venue of one of the Gala's famous afterparties.\"\n\nRelated: All of Taylor Swift's Met Gala Looks Through the Years\n\nThe Mark Restaurant By Jean-Georges and Caviar Kaspia are two high-end dining options in The Mark hotel -- and on Met Gala day, they're on go mode.\n\n\"Room Service runs on a tight flow,\" Haro says, noting that the majority of the guests remain on the property. Plus, abcV, the plant-forward concept from Jean-Georges will have a pop-up on Met Gala day, offering guests exciting, plant-based dishes.\n\nHaro pointed out a few memorable \"special requests\" guests had in years past. He said someone once asked for \"a continuous flow of fried chicken!\"\n\nAs for the \"most ordered\" item on Met Gala day? Surprisingly not champagne, says Haro, rather coffee. \"We serve an average of three cups per minute throughout the day!\" he reveals.\n\nThe elevators in The Mark are strategically monitored on Met Gala day. \"This is one of the most critical aspects of the day,\" Haro says.\n\nFrom the floors to the streets surrounding the hotel and everywhere in between, he says The Mark has a \"core team of forty collaborators\" who help coordinate a celebrity's departure from the building.\n\n\"Elevators are operated manually and sent for pick-up as soon as the floor team advises of an imminent departure,\" Haro explains. \"The celebrity's journey is monitored so that our transportation coordinators can get the right car in front of the hotel at the right time and ensure the process is flawless.\"\n\nHaro says \"timing is essential on the day,\" so for the system to work seamlessly, he says \"it requires a perfect coordination between many stakeholders.\"\n\nDue to the large number of notable names and prominent figures staying at The Mark during the Met Gala, Haro says \"securing the event is critical\" to ensure everyone \"feels safe and comfortable\" as they prepare for the big night.\n\n\"On the day itself, the street is cleared and access to The Mark is limited to our guests and their teams,\" he explains. \"The Mark has established itself as the home of many high-profile guests, so our security team is trained to handle the crowds that such a day brings.\"\n\nHaro adds, \"We also receive the support of the NYPD, whose officers do an incredible job.\"\n\nThe Mark has many standout amenities, including a salon home to the flagship of celebrity hairdresser Frederic Fekkai. \"He and his team have a very big day,\" Haro says in reference to the Met Gala.\n\nThe hotel also prides itself in providing guests the quintessential N.Y.C. experience, but making it luxurious at the same time! The Mark Hautedog Cart is among the highlights, serving up guests the classic barbecued dish but prepared in the gourmet kitchen of Jean-Georges.\n\nRelated: Zendaya's Met Gala Dress Hasn't Even Been Made Yet, According to Her Stylist\n\nAll members of a guest's family are invited to stay at The Mark -- dogs, too!

And the world is sad/heaves a collective sigh of relief.\n\nAfter taking weeks to nest with Travis out of the spotlight, the Eras superstar got back to work and Taylor Swift dropped a double album.\n\nThis is a huge time for Taylor's career. And, in between football seasons, this is a major time for Travis.\n\nSo why are they thumbing their noses at the Met Gala instead of showing up together? They have very good reasons.\n\nBoth Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce received Met Gala invitations\n\nTurns out,as TMZ reports, both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce RSVP'ed \"no\" to the biggest celebrity fashion event of the year.\n\nNotably, Taylor and Travis received separate invitations. So this would not have been a case of Taylor bringing Travis as her Plus One.\n\nSo they both, separately, turned it down. That's not quite the same as Taylor turning it down for both of them.\n\nWhy did Taylor Swift turn down the Met Gala?\n\nNo one needs an excuse to turn down an invite, even though the star-studded Met Gala is a charity event. However, Taylor has a solid reason.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala takes place on May 6.\n\nTaylor resumes her Eras World Tour on May 9 -- that same week. She'll need to travel to Europe and get everything set up in France. Especially because it's rumored she has to work in a whole new Era into the set list.\n\nYes, it's looking very plausible The Tortured Poets Department will be included for the first time in her first show back. And one does not simply slip in new music. The Eras tour is a very precise production.\n\nIn short, she's skipping the Met Gala to make sure her fans are better served!~\n\nWhy did Travis Kelce turn down the Met Gala?\n\nUnlike Taylor, Travis' professional obligations are (mostly) on pause. One of the many football facts that Taylor's fans have learned against our will is that the season ended before the Super Bowl and will not resume until late this summer.\n\nSo while Travis might be doing endorsements and other projects, he won't need to grace any sportsball fields with his presence the week of the Met Gala. You might've thought so given the big pay raise he got to play for 3 more years, but no.\n\nThe most likely explanation for Travis' absence is that he plans to travel to Europe to support Taylor as her Eras World Tour continues. He already said as much.\n\nThey may have a shared reason for turning down the invite\n\nFrom the moment that the public first linked the two, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been one of the most famous couples on the planet.\n\nTaylor of course is a household name on multiple continents. And Travis was very well-known within the subculture of sports fans.\n\nHowever, they have yet to make a \"red carpet debut\" of any kind. They've vacationed together and embraced on the field of the Super Bowl. But, if they attended the Met Gala arm-in-arm, it would be a major relationship milestone.\n\nThe Met Gala will still be a star-studded spectacle\n\nEven without Taylor Swift and her athletic arm candy, the Met Gala will boast big names -- including both fan-favorites and some exciting newcomers.\n\nTaylor would be a welcome sight. So would Travis. It would be fascinating to see if Travis would stick to the prompt or pull a \"looking camp right in the eye\" ridicule-worthy flop like Karlie Kloss did in 2019.\n\nIt would be amazing if a football player outdid a bunch of alleged fashion icons at a fashion event. Oh well -- perhaps at the 2025 Met Gala, if Taylor and Travis are still an item.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Set list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlie_Kloss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karlie Kloss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Course_Architecture", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Course Architecture", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/04/0419_taylorswift_header.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1162, "textEnd": 1167}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1208, "textEnd": 1213}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

What we like most about her 2014 ensemble is just how youthful, fresh and fun it is, particularly at an event where we secretly suspect laughs are actually few and far between.\n\nOf course, having fun with fashion would eventually become RiRi's forte, as we're about to discover later down this list...\n\nThis outfit might not be to everybody's tastes, but if anyone on earth can pull off this enormous Balenciaga coat with a matching bejeweled beanie, it's Rihanna - and we're big fans of the makeup and jewellery.\n\nIn 2021, Rih walked the red carpet with A$AP Rocky, marking their first ever public appearance as a couple, and within a few months, the We Found Love singer would confirm she was expecting their first child.\n\nA pregnant Rih certainly made an entrance when she and A$AP Rocky arrived late at the Met Ball in 2023, with most guests already seated at their tables by the time the Grammy winner made her way down the red carpet.\n\nStill, what an outfit this was. Between the massive flower coat (which turned into a completely different look when she took down the hood) and those white gloves, there was a lot to love, but we all know the true star of the show...\n\n...were those incredible sunglasses.\n\nBack in 2009, Rihanna was still in the early days of experimenting with a more avant-garde and daring style than we had been used to seeing from her at that time.\n\nMixing masculine and feminine, with her suit trousers, bow tie and towering heels, Rihanna gave one of the stand-out looks of the night that year, and she would carry on serving similar fashion moments to this while promoting her fourth album Rated R, which was released later that year.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this was the then-21-year-old's first red carpet appearance after being physically assaulted by ex-boyfriend Chris Brown just a few months earlier, making this already powerful (and, in our opinion, underrated) look even more impactful.\n\nRihanna was one of the co-chairs of the Met Gala in 2018, so the stakes were especially high when it came to the red carpet.\n\nFortunately, she more than delivered, giving us the stand-out moment of the whole night.\n\nWhat's funny about this outfit is that while some critics on social media suggested it was blasphemous or in poor taste, the Vatican actually endorsed the theme that year, and Rihanna herself borrowed part of her outfit from an actual Catholic Cardinal.\n\nThe dress that spawned a thousand memes, whether you thought it looked like a pizza, an omelette or a tribute to Big Bird, Rihanna's 2015 look was one that got absolutely everyone talking.\n\nRihanna later revealed that shex actually stumbled on the dress while Googling Chinese couture online, telling Vanity Fair: \"I'm so in love with this dress, but the train is insane!\n\n\"I can't really walk in it without any help -- but it's so worth it.

I found it online.\"\n\nIt was a big year for Rihanna at the 2015 Met Gala, not only winning the red carpet but performing during the event (in a much more stage-friendly ensemble, obv).\n\nThere are always one or two cop-outs on the Met Gala red carpet, with celebs preferring to wear something pretty or flattering rather than actually stick to the event's theme - but 2016 was next level.\n\nBecause the night was inspired by Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons, the fashion house known for their elaborate and outlandish silhouettes, many of the stars in attendance opted for something a little more simple than the invitation requested.\n\nNot Rihanna, though.\n\nShe hit the red carpet in this enormous creation, ensuring all eyes were on her and serving us a look so iconic it's literally the one that's used to illustrate the Met Gala on Wikipedia.\n\nNot only is it stunning and inventive (and actually nails that year's theme, when so many opted not to even try), it's also tonnes of fun, completely exemplifying everything we love about Rihanna's fashion.", "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Girl_Gone_Bad_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Girl Gone Bad Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umbrella (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name-dropping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Name-dropping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Rocky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASAP Rocky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Found_Love", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "We Found Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balenciaga", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balenciaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guo_Pei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guo Pei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blasphemy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wikipedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bow tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silhouette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avant-garde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio mixing (recorded music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5eac2e67220000690d827ff7.png?cache=LevH6tOlsH&ops=1200_630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Streams will also be available to US viewers on NBC's Peacock streaming platform and E!.\n\nInternational viewers can tune in via Instagram, X and TikTok.\n\nYou can follow the BBC's live blog for updates.\n\nThe Met Gala's theme often serves as a prelude to the Costume Institute's spring 2024 exhibition - and this year is no different.\n\nThe exhibit - Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion - uses technology to \"breathe new life\" into garments from the Met's archives so fragile they can no longer be worn and must remain under glass.\n\nArtificial intelligence, computer-generated imagery, X-rays, soundscapes and other formats will be used in \"creative and immersive activations designed to convey the smells, sounds, textures, and motions\" of these items, according to the museum's website.\n\nThe dress code for Monday's red carpet is The Garden of Time, which shares its name with a dystopian tale written in 1962 by JG Ballard, in which the last bastion of the super-rich is overrun by a working-class mob of the \"great unwashed\".\n\nCommentators are calling it an exploration of rebirth and renewal, and of humanity's tendency towards cycles of creation and destruction.\n\nFor an event that celebrates affluence and excess in an age of economic uncertainty and global volatility, the theme may sound a little on the nose.\n\nThe short answer is no. Fashion's biggest night is a cocktail and dinner party for about 400 to 450 invited guests.\n\nWealthy celebrities and brands snap up all the available tickets and tables at the charity benefit.\n\nAn individual ticket goes for around $75,000 (\u00a340,000), more than the average down payment on a house.\n\nA 10-seat table starts at $350,000.\n\nLast year, the gala - whose theme paid tribute to late design legend Karl Lagerfeld - raised about $22m.\n\nIn 1995, Ms Wintour's first year overseeing the event, a ticket cost just $1,000.\n\nMs Wintour has tapped four big names to serve as co-chairs at this year's event.\n\nThey are Latino music stars Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, US actress Zendaya and Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, making his debut at the gala.\n\nCo-chairs help promote the event, plan its theme and dinner, and arrive at the beginning of its red carpet portion.\n\nServing as honorary chairs are Shou Zi Chew, chief executive officer of TikTok, and Jonathan Anderson, the creative director of the Loewe's fashion house.\n\nTikTok - currently under the threat of a nationwide ban - and Loewe's are also sponsoring the gala and exhibition.\n\nThe guest list is always top secret, but several celebrities have already confirmed their attendance.\n\nPower couple Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are currently not slated to attend. Neither is Jared Leto, who often stands out among the male attendees.\n\nSpeculation is also rife over the likelihood of appearances by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is facing multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits, and Kendrick Lamar, who is locked in a heated war of words with rival rapper Drake.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Often, it's outside of the Mark and Carlyle Hotels in New York City, where countless celebrities get ready before heading to the event.\n\nThe hotels, both located on the Upper East Side in Manhattan and conveniently situated one block away from each other, have rich histories.\n\nThe Mark was built nearly 100 years ago in 1926 and began hosting Met Gala attendees in 2009. It has housed innumerable celebrities over the years, including Anna Wintour, Kendall Jenner, Selena Gomez, Cara Delevigne, Blake Lively and many more. It features an impressive 106 rooms and 46 suites.\n\n\"The energy on the day is incredible,\" Etienne Haro, the general manager of The Mark, told People in an interview published on May 6. \"It goes crescendo starting with the positioning of the red carpet early in the morning, followed by the delivery of the flowers and the arrival of the glam squads. As the day progresses, the intensity is palpable.\"\n\nLike The Mark, The Carlyle goes above and beyond to ensure that its Met Gala guests are comfortable.\n\n\"It's everything from the small touches of the pillowcases to the amenities that we place into the guest rooms, to the red carpet that goes out the morning of the Met Gala,\" hotel manager Tony Mosca told Women's Wear Daily in April 2023.\n\nEvery year, both hotels are booked months in advance by celebrities in the lead up to the Met Gala. This year is sure to have been no exception. On the day, their elevator traffic is tightly monitored to coordinate each celebrity's entrance and departure. The security outside each hotel is also heavily amped up to protect celebrities as they pass by throngs of fans and photographers behind the barricades.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kira_barrett@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kira Barrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carlyle_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Carlyle Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper East Side"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper East Side"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cara_Delevingne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cara Delevingne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Hotel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlyle Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Wear_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Wear Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Where-Do-Celebrities-Get-Glammed-Before-the-Met-Everything-to-Know-About-The-Mark-and-Carlyle-Hotels.jpg?crop=0px%2C137px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 981, "textEnd": 986}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Especially, if it's Met Gala, she has to be unique. Ahead of her red carpet appearance at the prestigious event, Natasha took to Instagram and dropped pictures of her look.\n\nNatasha donned a quilt-like gown with a thigh-high slit and a pillow attached to her back. She wrote, \"Sleeping Beauty Met Day!!! I couldn't think of anything better than this Viktor and Rolf piece from their AW2018 collection to honour the opening of The Met's latest exhibition; resuscitating iconic fashion and honouring legendary mastery in craft and design. Excited to be celebrating The Costume Institute later today!\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast year, Natasha's Schiaparelli gown, reminiscent of futuristic couture, showcased avant-garde design and bold silver hues. She opted for a sleek ponytail that she adorned with silver accessories.\n\nBefore that, she wore designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee's ensemble. Her saree with bustier and elaborate jewellery gave the red carpet a dash of Indian elegance. The designer wrote on Instagram, \"Sabyasachi contributed to Natasha's vision by celebrating Indian craftsmanship with a gold handcrafted printed tulle sari and trail embroidered with silk floss thread and embellished with bevel beads, semi-precious stones, crystals, sequins, and applique printed velvet.\"\n\nThe Met Gala, often hailed as 'Fashion's Biggest Night', will uphold its tradition by returning on the first Monday of May. This year's theme is 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion'. Unlike previous themes, this year's focus will be on reviving unique garments from various centuries, offering a novel perspective to fashion enthusiasts. While the gala will celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,' the official dress theme is 'The Garden of Time.'\n\nThis year's exhibition will feature significant pieces spanning over 400 years of fashion history, showcasing iconic designers such as Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, and Hubert de Givenchy. Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth, and Bad Bunny will serve as the night's co-chairs. The theme aims to celebrate delicate pieces of fashion that are often deemed too fragile for wear, affectionately termed the 'sleeping beauties'.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabyasachi_Mukherjee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabyasachi Mukherjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Beauty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_&_Rolf", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor & Rolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sari"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustier", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bustier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avant-garde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulle_(netting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulle (netting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_de_Givenchy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert de Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Velvet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appliqu\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appliqu\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yves Saint Laurent (designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gemstone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting_and_Crochet", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting and Crochet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/natashamet2024_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freya_Allan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freya Allan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritz-Carlton_Hotel_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Witcher (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_content_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief content officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Anderson_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Anderson (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gala (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/06/19/84521265-0-image-m-45_1715018782884.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-05-", "textStart": 2111, "textEnd": 2117}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Cue Hemsworth's 59 million Instagram followers, and that may give you a clue. Surprisingly, this is his first time attending the gala, so to be elevated straight to co-chair is quite a feat.

Rihanna's Iconic 'Omelette' Dress (2015): Rihanna turned heads in a yellow gown by Chinese designer Guo Pei, which drew comparisons to a luxurious omelette. The voluminous train and intricate detailing made it one of the most talked-about looks of the night.\n\n2. Katy Perry's Chandelier Ensemble (2019): Katy Perry lit up the red carpet in a chandelier-inspired outfit by Moschino. Complete with working lights and crystal embellishments, the whimsical ensemble perfectly captured the gala's theme of 'Camp: Notes on Fashion.'\n\n3. Bjork's Swan Dress (2001): Icelandic singer Bjork made a surreal entrance at the Met Gala in a swan-shaped dress designed by Marjan Pejoski. The avant-garde ensemble, complete with a nest-like headdress, left a lasting impression on attendees and fashion enthusiasts alike.\n\n4. Sarah Jessica Parker's Flame Headdress (2015): Known for her bold fashion choices, Sarah Jessica Parker made a statement at the Met Gala with a flaming headdress by Philip Treacy. Paired with a black gown by H&M, the fiery accessory added drama to her ensemble.\n\n5. Jared Leto's Head-Turning Gucci Ensemble (2019): Jared Leto embraced the theme of 'Camp: Notes on Fashion' with a striking Gucci ensemble that featured a replica of his own head as an accessory. The surreal look sparked a mix of awe and confusion among onlookers.\n\n6. Katy Perry's Moschino Hamburger Dress (2019): Katy Perry returned to the Met Gala in another attention-grabbing ensemble, this time dressed as a larger-than-life hamburger. Designed by Jeremy Scott for Moschino, the playful outfit showcased the singer's sense of humour.\n\n9. Billy Porter's Egyptian-Inspired Entrance (2019): Billy Porter stole the show at the 2019 Met Gala with a jaw-dropping entrance carried by six shirtless men, channelling ancient Egyptian royalty. The custom-made ensemble by The Blonds featured intricate gold embellishments and a dramatic wingspan, solidifying Porter's status as a fashion icon.\n\n10. Kim Kardashian's all-black Balenciaga look (2021): Kim caused a stir by donning a full black ensemble that concealed her well-known visage. She appeared fully made up underneath the face covering. This choice wasn't her favourite, as she resisted it initially, questioning the need to obscure her face. However, Balenciaga's creative director, Demna Gvasalia, and the team insisted that the outfit was appropriate for a costume gala, emphasizing the theme over conventional notions of beauty, as per E! News.\n\nAs we eagerly await the fashion spectacle that is the 2024 Met Gala, these unforgettable and often bizarre looks serve as a reminder of the event's ability to push the boundaries of creativity and self-expression.\n\nThe Met Gala 2024 will be held on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Ballard. Ultimately, the theme leaves plenty of room for interpretation, as attendees will celebrate nature while nodding to the exhibition itself, which spotlights historical fashion. You can expect a vast amount of archival magic - and that's a guarantee.\n\nCo-chairs for the 2024 Met Gala include Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya who join Vogue's very own Anna Wintour who are each set to welcome guests on the grand granite steps, for fashion's biggest and most celebratory night of the year.\n\nInside Vogue's May 2024 issue (with a Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda-clad Zendaya on the cover), the master photographer that is Steven Meisel profiled Elizabeth Debicki for an exceptional story shining a spotlight upon the pieces set to be featured throughout the exhibit. For example, a 2017 recreation of the iconic Junon dress from Christian Dior's Fall 2949 Haute Couture collection and the Upside-Down Rose hat from Philip Treacy's Spring 2000 Haute Couture collection.\n\nAny guesses as to who will be wearing what tonight?

Since 1948, stars have graced the Metropolitan Museum of Art with themed looks that range from dazzling to completely jaw-dropping.\n\nFans will see their favorite celebrities walk the carpet of this year's Met Gala on May 6.\n\nEach year the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York produces an exhibit honoring a theme, person, or moment in fashion. The gala itself honors the opening of the exhibit every year by creating a dress code that alignment with its subject. This year's exhibit is titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nThe actual exhibition within the museum is centered around honoring pieces of fashion that are so old or delicate that they can never be worn again. Meaning that these masterpieces have been forever put to rest or sleep.\n\nAccording to NBC News, not only is it an ode to one-of-a-kind craftsmanship, but the exhibition is divided into three sections: earth, land, and sea. Each will have unique relics dedicated to celebrating that aspect of nature, emphasizing the emotional art of design and its ties to our natural world, according to MET curator Andrew Bolton in Vogue.\n\nObviously, stars can't wear pieces that have been retired from carpet couture, although Kim Kardashian has tried. That's where the dress code differs from the theme itself. The dress code for the past several years has been created by Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and her co-hosts. The dress code aligns with the exhibition theme but it's never exactly the same.\n\nThis year's is \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\nThe dress codes are usually very illusive and interpretable, making it so that each look can be different. Too tight of a dress code makes for a boring carpet. The dress code was inspired by J.G. Ballard's short story by the same name, which is a science fiction story about the brevity of nature.\n\nOnline sleuths are already creeping on celebrity stylists to find hints about potential interpretations and celebrity appearances. Stylists could lean into the short story reference and make allusions to climate change, wilting flowers, or changing seasons. They could take inspiration from the exhibition theme itself, as some people have done in the past, with nods to floral fairytales. Or even dress as nature itself.\n\nDesigners including Alaia, Simone Rocha, Balenciaga, and Loewe are all rumored, or at least hoped to make high-fashion appearances on the red carpet this evening.\n\nOf course, we can hope, pray, and predict all we want, but the intrigue of the Met Gala is nobody knows what will happen until those stars step out onto the red carpet.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jensen_bird@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Jensen Bird", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loewe_(fashion_brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loewe (fashion brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Rocha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Rocha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balenciaga", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balenciaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fairy tale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Assemblage_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Assemblage Art", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/E21E1572-2C0F-4051-BC65-5EA71C8749C5.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 289, "textEnd": 294}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Since 2005, this event has been held on the first Monday of the fifth month of the year, so it will be tonight when the most famous figures on the international scene show off their best clothes on the famous stairs of the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\n\nThe party organized by Anna Wintour aims to raise money for the Costume Institute of the New York museum, but it also serves as the opening for the temporary exhibition that can be seen from May 10 to September 2.\n\nAs we all know, every year there is a different theme that inspires the outfits of many of the guests at the celebration. Last year, the outfits revolved around designer Karl Lagerfeld, but this time they wanted to give a title that gives rise to more interpretations. The chosen theme is titled The Garden of Time and is inspired by the story of the same name by J.G. Ballard from 1962. It should be noted that the museum's spring exhibition is called ''Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Awakens'', so expect lots of flowers and vintage clothing.\n\nThe Met Gala starts around six in the afternoon in New York City, so in Spain we can see the first shows around midnight. The event will last until dawn from Monday to Tuesday, which is why only Spaniards who go to bed late will be able to enjoy the live show.\n\nAs for the broadcast, Vogue has the exclusive, so the red carpet can be followed through its website Vogue.com and its different digital platforms (TikTok, YouTube, etc.). The event can also be seen from some media outlets such as The Associated Press or E!, which will broadcast live on their social networks.\n\nEach year, Wintour and her team choose different figures to take on the role of hosts of the Met Gala. In the last edition, Dua Lipa, Michaela Coel, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Wintour herself had the honor of playing this role.\n\nThis year, the expectation is enormous, since those chosen for said title are great figures from the world of cinema, television and music: Bad Bunny, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nAlthough the official list of attendees is a mystery that is revealed as the different figures appear on the red carpet of the event, it is expected that the hosts will bring their partners (Tom Holland, Ben Affleck and Elsa Pataky), as well as many take for granted the stellar appearance of Rihanna.\n\nThe presence of some of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters is also inevitably expected, who usually attract everyone's attention thanks to their extravagant outfits and their stunning outfits.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It was one of many iconic gowns worn by the singer at the Met Galas past: In 2015, Beyonc\u00e9 wore a barely-there, sheer gown, also by Givenchy, after arriving fashionably late (of course). The year before, she attended in Diana Ross-inspired Givenchy. (Famously, that same evening, Solange was captured on hotel security footage kicking at her sister's husband in the elevator while Beyonc\u00e9 stood to the side.)\n\nThough Page Six reports that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z may be hosting their own after-party this year, the Met Gala guest list remains a closely guarded secret. If Beyonc\u00e9 does attend, it would be for the first time in eight years.\n\nThis year's Met Gala honors the Costume Institute's 2024 spring exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The exhibition will be open to the public from May 10 until September 2, 2024, and will include roughly 250 garments and accessories spanning over four centuries.\n\nShe adds: \"However, the three sub-themes of land, sea, and sky will expand the textures and color schemes.

The model and boyfriend Green were reportedly seen pushing their newborn around in a stroller at the start of the year after the 42-year-old star previously posed with her bare bump on the cover of Vogue in December.\n\nBad Bunny kept it casual in a black and white look, capping it off with a pair of glasses and a hat.\n\nThe weekend festivities also included the Monse Maison Pre-Met Cocktail Celebration at Le Mercerie in SoHo, where Pamela Anderson stunned in a fresh-faced look and Doja Cat went pants-less.\n\nThis year's Met Gala theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" Max Hollein, CEO of The Met, said in a statement that the \"innovative\" exhibition -- and the accompanying star-studded annual fundraising gala -- will \"push the boundaries of our imagination and invite us to experience the multisensory facets of a garment.\"\n\nAccording to the announcement, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition will include garments that span over 400 years, and will be \"visually united by iconography related to nature, which will serve as a metaphor for the fragility and ephemerality of fashion.\"\n\nThe event's dress code is The Garden of Time, which is inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same title. According to Vogue, \"the most obvious interpretation would be to embrace the 'garden' part of 'The Garden of Time.' Think melancholic florals (as moody florals aren't moody enough).\"\n\nWhile the guest list is a closely-guarded secret, several stars have been seen in the Big Apple in recent days.\n\nRihanna has already confirmed her forthcoming appearance, telling British Vogue that she'll be at the swanky soir\u00e9e while teasing her red carpet look.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Pataky", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Pataky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sienna Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Roach", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law Roach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_Arabia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galliano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Galliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Louboutin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Louboutin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoHo,_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SoHo, Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "SoHo, Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miniskirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Anderson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pamela Anderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doja_Cat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doja Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The outfit was the star's answer to the theme: 'Camp: Notes on Fashion'\n\nDoja Cat: In 2023 the gala asked its guests to pay homage to designer Karl Lagerfield who passed away in 2019 from pancreatic cancer. The theme was 'Karl Lagerfeld: A Line Of Beauty' - prompting the rapper to pay tribute to his cat, Choupette. The stunning feline-inspired hooded gown was designed by Oscar de la Renta\n\nSimilarly, in 1996, a newly divorced Princess Diana sent shockwaves through the globe when she opted to go braless in a \u00a310,000 midnight blue Dior dress.\n\nTonight, the gala will have Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Zendaya and Chris Hemsworth as fashion co-chairs, along with Anna Wintour who has served as chair since 1995.\n\nAs excitement brews for the star-studded affair, FEMAIL takes a look back at the celebs who didn't disappoint and along the way have forged the most memorable looks in fashion.\n\nPrincess Diana: In 1996 a newly-divorced Diana attended the Met Gala in a Dior midnight blue dress, trimmed with black lace. The gown - rumoured to cost \u00a310,000 - was the sensation of the night. John Galliano, Dior's new designer, said that Diana had deliberately removed the interior bustier from the dress as 'it was a reflection of how she was already feeling'\n\nRihanna: The singer and mother-of two, 36, topped fashion lists in this delicately beaded ensemble by Maison Margiela complete with mitre and cropped cope. The stunning look was chosen for the gala's 2018 theme - 'Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination'\n\nBlake Lively: Also in 2018, the star actress turned heads across the globe in this gilded bodice and a sheer-panelled crimson skirt designed by Atelier Versace\n\nKim Kardashian: The reality superstar, 43, carved out a memorable fashion moment in this Balenciaga number, but the outfit choice has since received mixed reviews. The all black look, worn in 2021, included a face-concealing balaclava\n\nLady Gaga: In 2019 the Poker Face popstar commanded attention by stripping off layer after layer of haute couture clothing, all the way down to her sequined underwear. The star originally wore a fuchsia pink cape gown designed by Brandon Maxwell before undressing to reveal her lingerie\n\nCardi B: Also in 2019 The I Like It rapper struck a new chord in the fashion world when she donned this extravagant wine red number. The flamboyant gown - designed by Moschino - was complete with huge feathered shoulders and a jewelled red headpiece\n\nBeyonc\u00e9: The megastar turned heads in a striking see-through Givenchy number when she attended the Met Gala with husband Jay Z back in 2015. The theme was China: Through the Looking Glass\n\nLil Nas X: The controversial singer showed up to the Met Gala last year in nothing but a skintight silver thong to celebrate the theme: 'Karl Lagerfeld: A Line Of Beauty'. The silver body paint and encrusted jewels emphasised his sculpted physique\n\nJaden Smith: In 2017 the superstar son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett famously quipped 'Since I couldn't bring my sister as a date, I brought my old hair'. To celebrate the 'Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between' theme, the star, 25, donned a Louis Vuitton suit and heeled boots - and accessorised with his shaved dreadlocks\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham: Known for her impeccable style, Victoria opted for a sleek Giorgio Armani lace dress with silver strappy sandals despite 2008's theme being named as 'Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy'. David attended the gala in a suave black suit by the same designer\n\nRihanna: Years before she would go on to become a household name, the singing sensation made waves at her second ever Met Gala. Dressed in a fresh-off-the-runway Dolce & Gabbana suit, black leather gloves and donning a cropped haircut, the look became one of the most memorable from 2009\n\nBilly Porter: The American Horror Story: Apocalypse star, 54, stunned onlookers as he was carried by six shirtless men draped in gold Ancient Egyptian-inspired chokers, necklaces, face masks and jeans back in 2019\n\nJared Leto: 2019 saw many shocking firsts, including the actor's wild accessory - a sculpture of his head. Wearing Alessandro Michele for Gucci, the actor made a memorable mark in the red satin bejewelled number\n\nZendaya: Never one to shy away from best-dressed lists, the actress caused a stir in this illuminated Cinderella gown custom made by Tommy Hilfiger. The look was Zendaya's interpretation of the gala's 'Camp: Notes on Fashion' theme\n\nKate Moss: In 2009 the theme was 'The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion' which Kate Moss made utterly memorable in this shimmering Marc Jacobs open-back mini dress", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Actor Zendaya is co-chairing the event with Vogue editor Anna Wintour.\n\nBefore celebrities show off their impressive outfits for this year, Newsweek has taken a look at some of the most iconic Met Gala outfits that have graced the red carpet over the years.\n\nRihanna Wearing Guo Pei, 2015\n\nA variety of Rihanna's outfits could be included in this list but one that stands out the most is her outfit for the 2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass.\" For the event, the singer and businesswoman donned a canary yellow cape gown designed by Chinese couturier Guo Pei.\n\nIt took 20 months to make the embroidered fur-trimmed outfit, which weighed about 55 pounds and had a train that was three meters long. It quickly gained notoriety online, with many saying it was their favorite outfit from the event that year.\n\nBlake Lively Wearing Atelier Versace, 2022\n\nIn 2022 Blake Lively wore an Atelier Versace gown inspired by the Statue of Liberty for the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" On the night, the once bronze-colored dress changed to reveal a mint green color to show off the process of oxidation the statue has undergone.\n\nZendaya Wearing Versace, 2018\n\nFor 2018 the Met Gala theme was \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\" for which Zendaya and stylist Law Roach channeled Joan of Arc with a chain mail outfit. The custom gown featured armor-like details and a slinky train and the look was finished with an auburn wig.\n\nKate Moss Wearing Marc Jacobs, 2009\n\nFor the theme of \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion\" Kate Moss-who was the co-chair that year-wore Marc Jacobs, who was her date for the evening.\n\nThe gold metallic minidress had a matching head wrap and the outfit was finished off with custom YSL shoes. This is the perfect example of how a simple but well-executed outfit can do wonders.\n\nDoutzen Kroes Wearing Zac Posen, 2010\n\nFor the theme \"American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity\" Doutzen Kroes, a Victoria's Secret Angel at the time, created Cinderella-inspired magic with the help of designer Zac Posen. The pastel blue gown with its heavily bodied tulle skirt is a timeless piece of fashion.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Wearing Givenchy, 2015\n\nJust when everyone thought the 2015 Met Gala red carpet had finished, Beyonc\u00e9 arrived fashionably late wearing a sheer Givenchy gown that featured strategically placed crystals.\n\nLady Gaga Wearing Brandon Maxwell, 2019\n\nThe pop superstar was co-chair of the event in 2019, where she arrived in a series of outfits from designer Brandon Maxwell. While walking the red carpet Lady Gaga disrobed one layer at a time to reveal four separate outfits. The 2019 theme was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" inspired by Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on Camp.\"\n\nRihanna Wearing Maison Margiela, 2018\n\nIt's impossible to not include Rihanna for a second time in this list, as she wowed viewers with her 2018 outfit. This year the theme was \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and she went above and beyond.\n\nThe outfit was custom-made for the businesswoman and took 250 hours to sew and 500 hours to hand-embroider.\n\nEmma Watson Wearing Calvin Klein, 2016\n\nEmma Watson hit the 2016 theme \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\" on its head with her gown made from recycled plastic bottles. She collaborated with Calvin Klein and Eco Age for the outfit.\n\nElizabeth Hurley Wearing Gianni Versace, 1995\n\nBack in 1995, Elizabeth Hurley was considered one of the best-dressed stars at that year's Met Gala, then known as the Costume Institute Gala. The theme was simply \"Haute Couture\" and it was the first time that Wintour co-chaired the event.", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors":

Guests are invited to the gala by invitation and a single ticket can cost up to $50,000. Despite the price may seem steep, there are expected to be roughly 450 guests in attendance this evening.\n\nThis year's theme centers around the exhibition, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" which boasts roughly 250 rare pieces spanning 400 years of fashion history from the institute's permanent collection. The show includes pieces designed by Dior, Givenchy, and Schiaparelli, with some garments that are too fragile to be put on display, like a Charles Frederick Worth ball gown from 1877, being shown via video animation, light projection, AI, and CGI. The highly sensorial show is split into three categories from the natural world: land, sea, and sky.\n\nThe gala's official dress theme \"The Garden of Time\" was inspired by J.G. Ballard's titular short story from 1962. (The writer's texts also served as a source of inspiration for this year's Whitney Biennial.) As such, the red carpet will likely see a number of ensembles incorporating flora and fauna.\n\nThe star-studded event is expected to deliver, with celebrities Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Chris Hemsworth serving as the night's co-hosts.\n\nOf course, the entire celebration would not exist without Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who started it, and has become synonymous with the Met Gala since 1995.\n\nViewers can tune in via livestream on Vogue.com (and on the publication's associated digital platforms) to see the red carpet arrivals, beginning at 6 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "artnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARTnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "francesca_aton@artnews.com", "name": "Francesca Aton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "History of fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frederick_Worth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Frederick Worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_gown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ball gown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Biennial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitney Biennial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1486933964.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Actor Zendaya is co-chairing the event with Vogue editor Anna Wintour.\n\nBefore celebrities show off their impressive outfits for this year, Newsweek has taken a look at some of the most iconic Met Gala outfits that have graced the red carpet over the years.\n\nRihanna Wearing Guo Pei, 2015\n\nA variety of Rihanna's outfits could be included in this list but one that stands out the most is her outfit for the 2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass.\" For the event, the singer and businesswoman donned a canary yellow cape gown designed by Chinese couturier Guo Pei.\n\nIt took 20 months to make the embroidered fur-trimmed outfit, which weighed about 55 pounds and had a train that was three meters long. It quickly gained notoriety online, with many saying it was their favorite outfit from the event that year.\n\nBlake Lively Wearing Atelier Versace, 2022\n\nIn 2022 Blake Lively wore an Atelier Versace gown inspired by the Statue of Liberty for the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" On the night, the once bronze-colored dress changed to reveal a mint green color to show off the process of oxidation the statue has undergone.\n\nZendaya Wearing Versace, 2018\n\nFor 2018 the Met Gala theme was \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\" for which Zendaya and stylist Law Roach channeled Joan of Arc with a chain mail outfit. The custom gown featured armor-like details and a slinky train and the look was finished with an auburn wig.\n\nKate Moss Wearing Marc Jacobs, 2009\n\nFor the theme of \"The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion\" Kate Moss -- who was the co-chair that year -- wore Marc Jacobs, who was her date for the evening.\n\nThe gold metallic minidress had a matching head wrap and the outfit was finished off with custom YSL shoes. This is the perfect example of how a simple but well-executed outfit can do wonders.\n\nDoutzen Kroes Wearing Zac Posen, 2010\n\nFor the theme \"American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity\" Doutzen Kroes, a Victoria's Secret Angel at the time, created Cinderella-inspired magic with the help of designer Zac Posen. The pastel blue gown with its heavily bodied tulle skirt is a timeless piece of fashion.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Wearing Givenchy, 2015\n\nJust when everyone thought the 2015 Met Gala red carpet had finished, Beyonc\u00e9 arrived fashionably late wearing a sheer Givenchy gown that featured strategically placed crystals.\n\nLady Gaga Wearing Brandon Maxwell, 2019\n\nThe pop superstar was co-chair of the event in 2019, where she arrived in a series of outfits from designer Brandon Maxwell. While walking the red carpet Lady Gaga disrobed one layer at a time to reveal four separate outfits. The 2019 theme was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" inspired by Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on Camp.\"\n\nRihanna Wearing Maison Margiela, 2018\n\nIt's impossible to not include Rihanna for a second time in this list, as she wowed viewers with her 2018 outfit. This year the theme was \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" and she went above and beyond.\n\nThe outfit was custom-made for the businesswoman and took 250 hours to sew and 500 hours to hand-embroider.\n\nEmma Watson Wearing Calvin Klein, 2016\n\nEmma Watson hit the 2016 theme \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\" on its head with her gown made from recycled plastic bottles. She collaborated with Calvin Klein and Eco Age for the outfit.\n\nElizabeth Hurley Wearing Gianni Versace, 1995\n\nBack in 1995, Elizabeth Hurley was considered one of the best-dressed stars at that year's Met Gala, then known as the Costume Institute Gala. The theme was simply \"Haute Couture\" and it was the first time that Wintour co-chaired the event.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The revelation was met with a myriad of confused individuals online, predicting a display of designer pajamas on the red carpet for the famous opening as well as a parade of princesses on the museum steps thinking Sleeping Beauties was a reference to the classic Disney cartoon. Yet neither is correct.\n\nSo, if the theme doesn't involve nighties or knights, what does Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion mean?\n\nFirst, let's dive into the intention of the exhibition.\n\nThe new exhibition promises to feature 250 archival pieces from the Costume Institutes' permanent collection, some dating back 400 years to the Elizabethan period. According to Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu curator in charge of the Costume Institute, the entire exhibition centers on 50 historical garments, latent and so fragile that they can never again be worn by the sleeping beauties of the exhibition. The main motivator piece was a Charles Frederick Worth original, a silk satin ball gown dating from 1877. Each delicate piece, some no longer in their true form, will be reimagined in innovative cases designed to bring new life to the clothes.\n\nWhile the movement inherent in each piece is apparent even in a state of stillness, computer-generated images, sound design, light projection, Peppers' ghost illusion technique and video animation will be installed to propel these pieces out of their decor.\n\nJust as a 17th-century bodice is meant to be contextualized alongside a modern acquisition, each archival treasure will be juxtaposed with more current designs from renowned designers like Stella McCartney, Phillip Lim, Yves Saint Laurent, Elsa Schiaparelli and Christian Dior , all mimicking the same structural concept as its counterpart.\n\nThrough careful conservation, the organic essence of each textile piece will be classified into three zones or sections: land, sea and sky. In doing so, the idea is to highlight views of the natural world, how the perception of these spaces has changed and how they have been configured in fashion. In other words, we will be able to see the evolution of nature and how it was developed by the inventors of the industry.\n\nStandout pieces from Alexander McQueen, such as the knife-shaped dress from Voss' Spring/Summer 2001 collection and the mesmerizing butterfly dress from Sarah Burton's debut collection at the fashion house in 2011, will be featured.\n\nOverall, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion intends to unearth tangible pieces of history, some of which were buried years ago, to motivate conversation about natural elements and emotion, as well as to pay homage to the intimacy between a garment and its wearer with the transformative power of today's technology.\n\nAs for this year's dress code, Voguelooked at the romantic notion of eternal beauty with The Garden of Time. The title is the same as JG Ballard's 1962 story, inspired by a devastating dystopian vision detailing the story of Count Axel, the Countess, and their intrinsic crystalline garden with time-controlling properties. Count Axel is forced into a paradox: he must pick each flower to reverse time and prevent an angry mob from destroying the peaceful estate.\n\nDepending on the focus of the exhibition and the dress code of the gala, we can expect to see the stars attending the Met Gala, the Costume Institute's annual benefit held on the first Monday in May, in period pieces on measure or revisited that channel all or one of the sections with embellishments reflecting on the preservation of the environment.\n\nDesigners often collaborate with celebrities to create interpretations of looks from past runway shows, but this time they will most likely imagine traditional structures, constructed with organic fabrics and materials. Looks should implement a historical aspect, recalling the evolution of fashion in tandem with conversations and feelings about climate and landscape. We can see many creatives exploiting figures from the Elizabethan era, playing with long, full silhouettes. Floral details or rosettes are also to be expected. But one guarantee for the Met Gala every year is that the stars dress up with absolutely no intention of being themed. So, who knows, maybe someone will show up in their matching pajama set.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauties_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Beauties (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frederick_Worth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Frederick Worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yves Saint Laurent (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Lim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phillip Lim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bodice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_gown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ball gown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabethan era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander McQueen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pajamas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pajamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_McCartney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stella McCartney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sound design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/09/20/newFile-5.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Etienne Haro, general manager of The Mark, tells PEOPLE exclusively that they're expecting around 60 celebrity guests on May 6 in addition to their respective talent and glam teams. Previous guests on Met Gala day include Cardi B, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade and Gigi Hadid.\n\n\"The Mark is booked out well ahead of Met Gala day,\" he says, noting that the hotel's sales team starts \"receiving enquiries from the moment the annual theme is revealed.\" (The Met Gala's theme for 2024, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" was announced back in November 2023.)\n\nThe sixteen-story building offers 106 rooms, 46 suites and 1 penthouse suite -- but among the busiest quarters of the nearly-century old hotel is its striking lobby, particularly in the hours leading up to the fashion f\u00eate.\n\n\"The energy on the day is incredible. It goes crescendo starting with the positioning of the red carpet early in the morning, followed by the delivery of the flowers and the arrival of the glam squads,\" Haro says. \"As the day progresses, the intensity is palpable.\"\n\nBeing fashionably late the ball is simply not an option for the Met Gala, which explains why Haro says \"there is a real sense of urgency\" up until the stars' head on their way. \"Minutes before the first departure, the lobby suddenly clears. What follows is two hours of the most incredible display of fashion.\"\n\nHaro adds: \"The Met Gala's reputation as 'fashion's biggest night' is certainly not an overstatement -- and nor is ours, as 'the starriest hotel lobby in the world.'\"\n\nRead on for everything to know about The Mark ahead of the highly-anticipated sartorial scene.\n\nBuilt in 1926, The Mark was designed in a neo-Italian Renaissance-style and erected by architects Schwartz & Gross. The landmark building blends modern luxury with quintessential charm of old New York.\n\nThe hotel is located at 25 East 77th Street, on the corner of 77th Street and Madison Avenue on New York's Upper East Side. Its neighborhood is perfectly situated near Manhattan hotspots, including the \"The Met\" and Central Park. Plus, a number of art galleries, restaurants and high-end shops are in the vicinity.\n\nCelebrities grace The Mark red carpet prior to hitting the Met Gala's covered steps, a tradition that began when the hotel reopened in 2009. It serves as the ultimate sartorial send off of stars following their anticipated outfit reveals.\n\nHaro tells PEOPLE the \"natural light, elegance, comfort, privacy and ultra-personalized service\" of The Mark are \"key attributes\" that celebrities and their glam teams enjoy as they prepare for the big night. Plus, he says guests can \"rest, dress and celebrate all in the same space.\"\n\nSnagging an invite to the Met Gala is hard, but booking a room on Met Gala day is equally exclusive! Haro says the hotel is \"booked out well ahead\" of the ball, with inquiries starting when the \"theme is revealed\" and the \"first guests receive confirmation of their attendance.\"\n\nThe Mark's interior houses 106 rooms and 46 suites. \"We host about 60 celebrity guests over the period,\" Haro tells PEOPLE, noting that the \"the finest talents of the fashion world\" including designers, make-up artists, facialists, jewelers and more also fill up the space.\n\n\"The 153 rooms at The Mark are a rare commodity on Met Gala day,\" Haro says. Fortunately, he praises the sales team's \"tremendous job\" throughout the booking process to understand their guests' needs and requirements ahead of the rush to \"avoid disappointment.\"\n\nParisian interior designer Jacques Grange is the mastermind behind The Mark's sophisticated, yet vibrant inside. The mesmerizing black and white striped floors synonymous with the hotel were conceived by the French visionary, who's portfolio of clients includes everyone from late fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent to the Princess of Monaco.\n\nIn addition to its 106 rooms and 46 suites, The Mark houses 1 penthouse suite. In fact, it's the largest penthouse in the United States at more than 10,000 square feet including 2,500 square feet of rooftop terrace overlooking Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and breathtaking cityscape.\n\n\"The Mark Penthouse is nothing short of spectacular!\" says Haro, noting its five-bedroom suite over two floors and panoramic views over N.Y.C. \"It is a highly coveted accommodation on Met Gala [Monday], and one of the first suites we book each year.\"\n\nHaro was tight lipped on some of the starriest celebrities who have stayed in the penthouse suite, though he revealed, \"The booker has actually been the same for the past few years and it is the venue of one of the Gala's famous afterparties.\"\n\nThe Mark Restaurant By Jean-Georges and Caviar Kaspia are two high-end dining options in The Mark hotel -- and on Met Gala day, they're on go mode.\n\n\"Room Service runs on a tight flow,\" Haro says, noting that the majority of the guests remain on the property. Plus, abcV, the plant-forward concept from Jean-Georges will have a pop-up on Met Gala day, offering guests exciting, plant-based dishes.\n\nHaro pointed out a few memorable \"special requests\" guests had in years past. He said someone once asked for \"a continuous flow of fried chicken!\"\n\nAs for the \"most ordered\" item on Met Gala day? Surprisingly not champagne, says Haro, rather coffee. \"We serve an average of three cups per minute throughout the day!\" he reveals.\n\nThe elevators in The Mark are strategically monitored on Met Gala day. \"This is one of the most critical aspects of the day,\" Haro says.\n\nFrom the floors to the streets surrounding the hotel and everywhere in between, he says The Mark has a \"core team of forty collaborators\" who help coordinate a celebrity's departure from the building.\n\n\"Elevators are operated manually and sent for pick-up as soon as the floor team advises of an imminent departure,\" Haro explains. \"The celebrity's journey is monitored so that our transportation coordinators can get the right car in front of the hotel at the right time and ensure the process is flawless.\"\n\nHaro says \"timing is essential on the day,\" so for the system to work seamlessly, he says \"it requires a perfect coordination between many stakeholders.\"\n\nDue to the large number of notable names and prominent figures staying at The Mark during the Met Gala, Haro says \"securing the event is critical\" to ensure everyone \"feels safe and comfortable\" as they prepare for the big night.\n\n\"On the day itself, the street is cleared and access to The Mark is limited to our guests and their teams,\" he explains. \"The Mark has established itself as the home of many high-profile guests, so our security team is trained to handle the crowds that such a day brings.\"\n\nHaro adds, \"We also receive the support of the NYPD, whose officers do an incredible job.\"\n\nThe Mark has many standout amenities, including a salon home to the flagship of celebrity hairdresser Frederic Fekkai. \"He and his team have a very big day,\" Haro says in reference to the Met Gala.\n\nThe hotel also prides itself in providing guests the quintessential N.Y.C. experience, but making it luxurious at the same time! The Mark Hautedog Cart is among the highlights, serving up guests the classic barbecued dish but prepared in the gourmet kitchen of Jean-Georges.\n\nAll members of a guest's family are invited to stay at The Mark -- dogs, too! Known to be \"one of the most dog-friendly hotels in New York,\" it offers amenities for your four-legged friends to enjoy (including a special dog menu curated by Jean-Georges!).", "source": {"uri":

The stunning ensemble featured a sheer pink floral top embroidered with butterflies, which is most likely a nod to this year's dress code being \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by a short story by JG Ballard.\n\nThe Dune star completed the glamorous get-up with a pair of white Christian Louboutin pointed heels, wearing her hair in loose waves around her shoulders.\n\nMeanwhile, Lopez opted for a black strapless gown designed by Diana Qerimi. The dress featured crystal-like detailing all over and she added some extra height with a pair of black Casadei platform heels. The singer completed the look with a chic ponytail and a pair of dangling diamond statement earrings.\n\nHemsworth, who attended the dinner with his wife Elsa Pataky, 47, looked dapper in an animal-print design blazer that he wore over a black satin shirt for the dinner. The Thor actor added a pair of dark trousers and some orange-tinted glasses.\n\nPataky opted for a glittering blue sequin blazer and matching hot pants that she teamed with a purple silk blouse and a high ponytail for the evening.\n\nCo-chair Bad Bunny was also pictured arriving for the dinner wearing a dark blazer that he teamed with a simple white T-shirt. He wore the casual, but chic get-up with a baseball cap and glasses.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nSienna Miller, 42, and her boyfriend Oli Green, 27, were also among the attendees, with the pair enjoying a rare date night at the glitzy event. Miller donned a green suede one-sleeve mini dress for the dinner, that she teamed with some sheer black tights and a pair of pointed white heels.\n\nMeanwhile, Miller looked dapper in a black suit and white shirt that he left open at the top.

So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while,\" she said during an appearance on Live with Kelly and Mark on April 23.\n\nSpeaking about her stylist Law Roach, who she's been working with since she was 14, the star said, \"It's fun in the sense that I like to look at fashion as creativity.\"\n\n\"Even in press tours, it's a way to continue the creativity from the film. ... I like to just create characters, because ultimately sometimes, doing this for a living feels a little weird and awkward and I'm more of a shy, introverted person, so I get to create these characters.

made her Met Gala red carpet debut in 1999 and has been in attendance more than a dozen times since -- often with a partner or her gown's designer in tow.\n\nThis year will be especially exciting for Lopez because she, alongside Zendaya, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, will act as co-chair for the event, a hosting role that involves working months in advance with longtime Met Gala driving force and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, as well as showing up early to help set the tone for the evening.\n\nThe co-chairs -- as well as this year's dress code, \"Garden of Time\" -- were announced in a collaborative Instagram video between the Met and the Costume Institute in February that portrayed a cheeky group chat between the four stars and Wintour.\n\nIn anticipation of Lopez's arrival, we took a trip down memory lane to see several of her most iconic looks, from last year's ultra-feminine ensemble featuring a velvet bow train all the way back to 2004 when she posed with designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana while wearing one of their signature black lace gowns.\n\nRead on to see more, and check back May 6 to see what's in store for this year's biggest night in fashion.\n\nLopez went for a dramatic black and baby pink look by Ralph Lauren for the gala's 2023 edition honoring the late designer Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nDazzling in another Ralph Lauren look, Lopez channeled the American theme with Western-inspired couture.\n\nFor the Camp ball, the multi-hyphenate star donned a glimmering Versace number complete with a matching beaded fringe wig.\n\nLopez's Catholic upbringing came in as handy inspiration when she wore an opulently beaded Balmain gown complete with a cross chest plate and black feather train.\n\nAt the 2017 installment of the gala to pay homage to Japanese design icon Rei Kawakubo, Lopez went full-on \"Valley of the Dolls\" in a '60s-inspired Valentino gown with an era-perfect updo and makeup look.\n\nSkin was in for J.Lo as she strutted the red carpet alongside Donatella Versace wearing one of the designer's creations, a cascading red sequin dragon that swirled down her body and landed in illusion netting dotted with matching sequin \"flames.\"\n\nThe Met Gala's Punk year inspired Lopez to pull out a sequin animal print gown from Michael Kors, topped with a fauxhawk and smoked-out eyes to capture the spirit of the theme.\n\n2011's gala honored the late Alexander McQueen and inspired Lopez to wear a gown dripping in florals from Gucci, the design house with whom McQueen made a deal that allowed him to expand his empire.\n\nLopez donned a strapless dress by Zuhair Murad that dazzled with its simple A-line silhouette and extravagant appliques.\n\nWearing a very of-its-era Alberta Ferretti gown, Lopez was on trend with the one-shoulder design and voluminous hair for the superheroes-themed night.\n\nThe star shone brighter than ever in her 2007 Marchesa look for the gala, a gown that draped beautifully in keeping with the vision of the paradigm-shifting designer.\n\nPerhaps her least on-theme look came while wearing a relatively conservative, Italian-made Versace gown to the gala meant to honor transgressive British fashion (she looked gorgeous anyway, of course).\n\nLopez wore a showstopping Dolce & Gabbana look -- pictured with a modest fur shawl here -- while posing with the designers for the 2004 gala.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The mother of one sported a blunt blonde bob hairstyle and sunglasses as she added a sticker of a clock to her Story, signalling the countdown to the Met Gala.\n\nHadid's second Story post showed a glimpse at her supposed Met Gala ensemble for the evening, which appeared to be custom made by American fashion designer Thom Browne. The black and white label included \"Gigi Hadid\" written across it, along with the tagline: \"Met Gala 2024\".\n\n\"Met Prep,\" the Guest In Residence founder captioned another Instagram Story of her pre-Met Gala skincare. Her final social media post featured a close-up image of yellow roses, seemingly a nod to this year's Met Gala dress code, \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe Met Gala dress code takes inspiration from a short story of the same title, written by JG Ballard in 1962, which focuses on the theme of fleeting beauty. Attendees can embrace the obvious by wearing florals to represent an actual garden, or wear items that signify the passing of time, like clocks.\n\nIt coincides with the opening of the Costume Institute's annual exhibit, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\", which will be centred around 50 historically significant pieces of fashion - some too fragile ever to be worn again. Nearly 250 items were drawn from the Costume Institute's permanent collection, featuring designs from Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Givenchy to span 400 years of fashion history.\n\nThe exhibition will be focused on three main zones: land, sea, and sky. Each \"zone\" will symbolise the natural materials used within it to create garments.

The mother of one sported a blunt blonde bob hairstyle and sunglasses as she added a sticker of a clock to her Story, signalling the countdown to the Met Gala.\n\nHadid's second Story post showed a glimpse at her supposed Met Gala ensemble for the evening, which appeared to be custom made by American fashion designer Thom Browne. The black and white label included \"Gigi Hadid\" written across it, along with the tagline: \"Met Gala 2024\".\n\n\"Met Prep,\" the Guest In Residence founder captioned another Instagram Story of her pre-Met Gala skincare. Her final social media post featured a close-up image of yellow roses, seemingly a nod to this year's Met Gala dress code, \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe Met Gala dress code takes inspiration from a short story of the same title, written by JG Ballard in 1962, which focuses on the theme of fleeting beauty. Attendees can embrace the obvious by wearing florals to represent an actual garden, or wear items that signify the passing of time, like clocks.\n\nIt coincides with the opening of the Costume Institute's annual exhibit, titled \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\", which will be centred around 50 historically significant pieces of fashion - some too fragile ever to be worn again. Nearly 250 items were drawn from the Costume Institute's permanent collection, featuring designs from Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Givenchy to span 400 years of fashion history.\n\nThe exhibition will be focused on three main zones: land, sea, and sky. Each \"zone\" will symbolise the natural materials used within it to create garments. By emphasising the natural world and how its been used in fashion throughout time, sustainability will remain a key focus throughout the exhibit.\n\nAlong with Hadid, celebrities confirmed to be in attendance at this year's Met Gala are its co-chairs: Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Zendaya.\n\nFashion lovers can tune in to the Met Gala 2024 red carpet live stream at 6pm ET on Vogue's website and YouTube account.

The 2024 Met Gala red carpet is officially underway at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This year's exhibit, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" examines how technology can breathe new life into garments that are too old and fragile to be worn again.\n\nTonight, guests will ascend the museum's famed steps wearing outfits that nod to the event's \"The Garden of Time\" dress code, and you can see all of the Met Gala 2024 looks right here as the night unfolds. The night's sartorial theme gets its name from a J.G. Ballard story about a count who -- to stave off an angry mob nearing his castle -- cuts a rose from his garden to slow down time until there are no flowers remaining. With the story's dystopian undertones in tandem with the exhibit's emphasis on old and new, we can expect a red carpet filled with everything from florals to techno-inspired fashion -- and maybe even a Sleeping Beauty reference or two.\n\nThe gala, which fundraises for the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, is known for having a very secretive guest list. But while the attendees' names are kept tightly under wraps, we do know of a few people who will grace the carpet in their garden party finery: Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Zendaya, who are serving as co-chairs alongside Vogue's Anna Wintour. The rest of the esteemed attendees -- which includes the world's top singers, actors, models, athletes, and artists -- will reveal themselves in due time.\n\nBelow, see every look from the 2024 Met Gala red carpet, and check back in throughout the night for updates, or follow along in real time on our livestream or live blog.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Met Gala red carpet is always exciting, as celebrities reveal their interpretations of the event\u2019s dress code \u2013 which is The Garden of Time for 2024.\n\nBut it\u2019s also thrilling to see which stars ultimately attend the event, since the guest list is kept under wraps. For instance, there have been conflicting reports on whether Taylor Swift will attend the gala after releasing her record-breaking album The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nWhether she attends in 2024 or not, Swift\u2019s legacy at the Met Gala looms large. Take a look back at all the outfits she\u2019s worn to the event, ranked from least to most iconic.6. Taylor Swift\u2019s dress for the 2010 Met Gala was too simple\n\nSwift looked angelic in this white Ralph Lauren Collection gown with its off-the-shoulder sleeves and ruffled hem.\n\nBut the dress was too simple, and instead of elevating it with accessories, Swift instead wore minimal jewellery and kept her hair in a demure updo.\n\nThe look also didn\u2019t explicitly speak to the \u201cAmerican Woman: Fashioning A National Identity\u201d theme, making it a bit of a letdown \u2026 although Ralph Lauren is admittedly a quintessentially American designer.8 of the richest female athletes of 2024 \u2013 net worths, ranked5. The singer\u2019s dress fit the Savage Beauty theme for the 2011 Met Gala, but she could have done more with the look\n\nSwift upped her game for the 2011 \u201cAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\u201d gala, arriving in a one-shoulder J. Mendel gown with a mermaid skirt.\n\nThe dress fit the theme thanks to its mix of sheer fabric, layered skirt and contrasting colours.4. Swift\u2019s semi-sheer gown for the 2013 Met Gala was eye-catching\n\nIn one of her most daring looks up to that point, Swift sported another J. Mendel gown for the 2013 \u201cPunk: Chaos to Couture\u201d Met Gala.\n\nThe bodice of the black, floor-length gown was covered in cut-outs of sheer, webbed fabric. A jewelled collar and dramatic, smoky eye make-up completed the daring look, which was well suited to the punk theme.3. Swift\u2019s dress for the 2008 Met Gala hinted at her second album, Fearless\n\nSwift attended her first Met Gala in 2008 wearing a gold ombr\u00e9 gown from Badgley Mischka.\n\nThe dress suited the event\u2019s theme, \u201cSuperheroes: Fashion and Fantasy\u201d, as the head-to-toe embellishments and shape nodded to a mermaid tail. She paired the look with her signature curls worn loose.Who is the richest Sex and the City star in 2024? Net worths, ranked2. Swift stunned in an old Hollywood-inspired look at the 2014 Met Gala\n\nThe theme of the 2014 Met Gala was \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion\u201d. Swift arrived in a soft pink Oscar de la Renta gown that was embroidered with delicate flowers. The column dress had a low back and a dramatic train that flowed out from an oversized bow.1. Taylor Swift wore a robot-inspired dress to the 2016 Met Gala\n\nSwift was a Met Gala co-chair in 2016. She walked the Met Gala red carpet in a metallic dress custom designed by Louis Vuitton, a look perfect for the \u201cManus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\u201d theme. Swift paired the dress with heels that wrapped to her knees.\n\nBleached hair and black lipstick completed the futuristic look, and the departure from Swift\u2019s typically softer looks made it a stand-out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen:_Savage_Beauty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mermaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_x_Machina:_Fashion_in_an_Age_of_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_James_(designer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles James (designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bodice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_the_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex and the City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_de_la_Renta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar de la Renta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Vuitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lipstick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting_and_Crochet", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting and Crochet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/06/7d7d623a-b2ef-4120-8411-f0f9275309b2_e58c20d4.jpg?itok=NMKlZFYS", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541694", "eventUri": "eng-9541694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 447, "textEnd": 452}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 452725366, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 265, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 265}}}

What was once a vital part of a person's lived experience is now a motionless 'artwork' that can no longer be worn or heard, touched, or smelled. The exhibition endeavors to reanimate these artworks by re-awakening their sensory capacities through a diverse range of technologies, affording visitors sensorial 'access' to rare historical garments and rarefied contemporary fashions,\" curator Andrew Bolton said. \"By appealing to the widest possible range of human senses, the show aims to reconnect with the works on display as they were originally intended -- with vibrancy, with dynamism, and ultimately with life.\"\n\nThe 2024 theme goes hand-in-hand with the dress code, dubbed \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\nThe Met Gala's dress code is usually quite loosely interpreted by guests and is used as a jumping off point for outfits, making for some memorable red carpet moments.\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" is the name of the exhibit the Met Gala will be celebrating.\n\nThe story behind the name has to do with the garments that will be on display. Roughly 250 garments will be shown from the Costume Institute's collection of 33,000 pieces. Many of the ones that will be on display are typically never shown. Some are said to be too fragile to hang, for fear of them falling apart.\n\nInstead, they will lie in glass cases, like the fabled Sleeping Beauty.\n\n\"The Met's innovative spring 2024 Costume Institute exhibition will push the boundaries of our imagination and invite us to experience the multisensory facets of a garment, many of which get lost when entering a museum collection as an object. Sleeping Beauties will heighten our engagement with these masterpieces of fashion by evoking how they feel, move, sound, smell and interact when being worn, ultimately offering a deeper appreciation of the integrity, beauty and artistic brilliance of the works on display,\" Met Museum Director Max Hollein said.\n\nIn an interview Monday before the big event, Hollein said the garments are \"being reawakened using both traditional as well as cutting edge technologies.\"\n\n\"Sleeping Beauty\" is a classic fable of a beautiful princess who is sent into a magical sleep only to be reawakened by the kiss of her true love. It is frequently interpreted as being about how true love will conquer all.\n\n\"The Garden of Time\" is a short story by J.G Ballard that concerns a couple living in a beautiful home.\n\nA mob is slowly making its way toward them, bringing destruction. In the couple's garden grow \"time flowers,\" and each one that is plucked sends the mob back in time, further away from their inevitable arrival at their home. But the garden is no longer growing new flowers, and the destruction of their exquisite home and life together is inevitable.\n\nThe exhibition itself, like a garden, will also be a multisensory experience, designed to stimulate all the senses. The galleries will be arranged \"exploring a different theme inspired by the natural world,\" the Met said. As an example, the floors of one gallery space will be animated with snakes, and the ceiling of another with a projection of birds.\n\n\"Punctuating the exhibition will be a series of 'sleeping beauties' -- garments that can no longer be dressed on mannequins due to their extreme fragility -- that will be displayed in glass 'coffins' allowing visitors to analyze their various states of deterioration as if under a microscope,\" the Met said.\n\nThe Met Gala has had many memorable themes over the years. Last year's theme honored fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the \"In America\" theme served as parts one and two of a look back at American fashion through the years.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauties_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Beauties (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Beauty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolton_(curator)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bolton (curator)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Hollein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Hollein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The co-chairs for the evening include Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny, while Vogue's red-carpet hosts will be La La Anthony, Gwendoline Christie, and Ashley Graham, alongside special correspondent Emma Chamberlain.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" - which is not a reference the Disney fairytale. Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period. The idea is to reimagine fragile designs that can never be worn again in new ways through CGI, light projections, soundscaping, and video animation.\n\nGuests will follow a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" a nod to JG Ballard's 1962 tale. The story details Count Axel, his Countess, and their dwindling garden as an angry mob descends on their peaceful home and nursery of crystalline flowers.\n\nAlong with all four co-chairs and the event's organiser Anna Wintour, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, Cara Delevingne, and Olivia Rodrigo are expected to be at tonight's Met Gala, according to a 13 April Page Six report.\n\nThe broadcast of the 2024 Met Gala red carpet will begin at 6pm ET, with the event streaming on Vogue's TikTok and YouTube account.\n\n22:13 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAlthough Gigi Hadid has not yet arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she's teasing her look for the night.\n\nThe supermodel has revealed that she will be wearing Thom Browne on the green and white carpet. You can find everything we know about Hadid's look below.\n\nGigi Hadid teases her 'Met prep' with Thom Browne outfit for Met Gala 2024\n\n22:06 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAnna Wintour has officially arrived at the Met Gala. The Vogue editor chose a white and black look for the fashion extravaganza, with Wintour posing on the green and white carpet in a white gown and a black floral-embroidered jacket.\n\nWintour's arrival means the Met Gala is officially underway!\n\n22:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with People, published on 6 May, actor Chase Stokes opened up about being cordially invited to the fashion event. He also specified that when he received the invitation, he was with his girlfriend, Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n\"This is actually a crazy story,\" the Outerbanks star told the publication, as he'll be attending the Met Gala for the first time tonight. \"I had just flown from Morocco to Atlanta to do re-shoots for a movie with Netflix. It was a 26-hour travel day. I worked all day and then I had the next morning to do something. I was on the way to the aquarium with my girlfriend and we got the call. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're going to the Met.'\"\n\nHe added that when he and his partner got the call, it was \"a very wild moment\" that he would \"never, ever forget\".\n\n21:47 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nIt's still early in the night, which means we have hours yet before some of the biggest names grace the steps of The Met. However, fans outside of the museum are hopeful for glimpses of their favourites.\n\nSpeaking to Kaleigh Werner from across the street of the museum, Carly Fox said she is not entirely sure who she's most excited to see tonight, but she's eager to see Zendaya.\n\n\"Definitely Zendaya for sure, but I'm eager to see Sabrina Carpenter,\" she said.\n\nClaire, who also lined up for the chance to see A-listers as they enter the gala, said she's \"hoping to see Taylor Swift\" but she's \"not sure she'll go\".\n\n\"I'm also hoping to see Blake Lively because she's consistently one of my favourite dressed at The Met.\"\n\n21:43 , Amber Raiken\n\nZendaya will be walking the red carpet at the Met Gala tonight, as this is the first time she's attended the event since 2019. During an episode of Live with Kelly & Mark last month, the Euphoria star described why she's nervous about going to the 2024 Met Gala, where she's one of the co-chairs.\n\n\"I first went when I was 18 years old, and Law [Roach] and I, my stylist, we've been working together since I was like 14 years old. But I remember being 18 and it was such an exciting and new experience,\" she said. \"But still terrifying.\"\n\nZendaya continued: \"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years. So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while.\"\n\nZendaya reveals why it's 'terrifying' to go to the Met Gala\n\n21:39 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nThe red carpet has officially begun, with celebrities beginning to make their way to the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nYou can find all of the best-dressed stars on this year's green and white carpet below.\n\nDuring an episode of Today, which aired on 6 May, Jenna Bush Hager opened up about her one-on-one chat with Anna Wintour, leading up to the 2024 Met Gala. She noted that when she took the opportunity to ask Wintour if Taylor Swift would be at the fashion event this year, the Vogue Editor-in-Chief simply responded: \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\"\n\nBush Hager then acknowledged how Wintour's comment left room for interpretation about Swift's attendance, adding: \"So that could be yes, that could be no.\"\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, Wintour's remark came as there have been various reports that Swift won't be at the Met Gala. According to a report shared by TMZ last month, Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, both received invitations to the event, which is in support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's coveted costume institution.\n\nHowever, Swift will not be attending because the gala falls during the same week her Eras Tour will be returning from its break with a concert in Paris. This is no definitive reason why Kelce will not be going to the Met Gala, but TMZ reported he's likely skipping it because his girlfriend won't be there.\n\n21:23 , Kaleigh Werner\n\nWith just a few hours left until attendees begin to arrive on the red carpet, the streets outside of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City have filled with fans eager to see their favourite A-listers.\n\n21:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an appearance on Good Morning America, hours before the Met Gala, event co-chair Jennifer Lopez made a quip about her look for the red carpet. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight, she said: \"Barely, ever.\"\n\nHowever, she expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that lack of mobility, adding: \"The Met gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\n20:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring a conversation with Today host Jenna Bush Hager, aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour confirmed that chives, onion, and garlic are never a part of the food menu at the Met Gala. \"Those are three things I'm not fond of,\" she said.\n\nShe also opened up about cell phone use being banned from inside the gala, specifically during dinner time.\n\n\"It's often wonderful to hear after dinner, people say, 'Oh we had the most wonderful conversations,'\" Wintour said. \"That's the idea, that life can exist without a picture on your cell phone.\n\n19:45 , Amber Raiken\n\nHours before the fashion extravaganza, Marc Jacobs took to Instagram to tease that he'll be styling celebrities at this year's Met Gala. Along with a photo of four black silhouettes on Instagram, the caption of the post reads: \"Can you guess who Marc's dressing for tonight's Met Gala?\"\n\nIn the comments, many fans have gone on to guess which celebrity Jacobs could be styling, such as influencer Alex Consani, YouTube star Emma Chamberlain, model Hailey Bieber, or actor Jenna Ortega.\n\n19:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nFans have lined up outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art this afternoon, in anticipation of celebrities' upcoming arrival at the fashion extravaganza. While outside of the museum in New York City, people were also given pieces of tonight's red carpet, which were green and beige.\n\n18:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with Jenna Bush Hager for Today, which aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour discussed the theme of the 2024 gala: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the inspiration behind its dress code, \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,\" she said. \"When we came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties,' it's wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.\"\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of Vogue recalled that when establishing the theme, she turned to the Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton, for advice on what celebrities could wear. She also acknowledged that amid those conversations about outfits, the public was then confused about that dress code.\n\n\"I said, 'What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?' And he said, 'Well, what about 'Garden of Time?'\" she explained. \"So, I fear that we've unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologise.\"\n\n17:30 , Amber Raiken\n\nOver the weekend, the Metropolitan Museum of Art prepared for its annual fashion extravaganza by setting up its iconic tent, which celebrities step into when entering the gala.\n\nThis year, the front of the white tent includes a graphic of a rose, as it reads: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The tent name is a reference to the theme of the gala, which intends to dig up tangible pieces of history, some of which were put to rest years ago, to motivate conversation about natural elements and emotion, as well as pay homage to the intimacy between a garment and its wearer with the transformative power of current technology.\n\n16:54 , Amber Raiken\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala co-chairs - Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - are guaranteed to be at the event tonight, along, with the gala's hosts and sponsors: Loewe's creative director, Jonathan Anderson and TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAccording to a 13 April Page Sixreport, Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri are two newcomers to the Met Gala invite list this year. Additionally, a source speaking to the outlet said Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps too. Barry Keoghan is said to have gotten an invite for the second year in a row.\n\nWith these select individuals, we can also assume Vogue's two red carpet hosts, La La Anthony and Emma Chamberlain, will be back again.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n16:04 , Amber Raiken\n\nWhenever the Met Gala is held, there are certain guidelines that guests will be expected to follow, should they want to stay in event organiser Anna Wintour's good books. And when we think about all the celebrities attending the event, some rules are a bit unexpected.\n\nFor example, one would think that all who attend an event as glitzy as the Met Gala would be forgiven for taking the odd photograph to capture special moments of the occasion. However, in 2015 it was reported that the use of social media had been banned from the event, to clamp down on celebrities spending the majority of the evening on their phones.\n\nHere are four other surprising rules guests are expected to follow when entering the Met Gala tonight.\n\nAccording to Vogue, invitees to tonight's event are meant to follow the dress code, \"The Garden of Time\" - telling the story of Count Axel, his countess, and their dwindling garden. From this, guests should know to represent fleeting beauty and refrain from wearing princess dress or pajama sets.\n\nHowever, not everyone opts to abide by the dress code's memo. Though the argument that every celebrity look worn to the Met Gala is subjected to criticisms and contrasting opinions, some've come out over the last 25 years that were undeniably a point of contention.\n\nFor example, Kim Kardashian wore one of Marilyn Monroe's iconic dresses to the Met Gala in 2022, prompting immediate controversy. People were angered by the Skims creator's decision to wear the actual dress, a piece that was already so fragile. Some claimed she tore the back of the dress until Ripley's confirmed the garment wasn't at all damaged.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable looks at the Met Gala over the years that were met with intense criticism.\n\nThe most controversial outfits worn to the Met Gala\n\n14:32 , Amber Raiken\n\nVogue will live-stream the highly-anticipated fashion event on its TikTok and YouTube accounts. While the broadcast is expected to begin at 6 pm, some celebrities will walk the red carpet on the museum's iconic steps a bit earlier than that.\n\nIn addition, E! News will also be covering the gala for its Live From E! broadcast tonight. As noted by E! News, the broadcast will \"give a sneak peek at stars' Met Gala 'fits as they depart from The Mark Hotel and The Pierre Hotel\" in New York City. TV host Ross Mathews will also be interviewing celebrities when they arrive at the museum, with the broadcast expected to run from 6 pm ET to 9:30 pm ET.\n\n13:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000. In 2023, the cost was $25,000 less for a single ticket.\n\nThere's no denying the Kardashian-Jenner women are show-stoppers on the Met Gala red carpet. Year after year, the reality TV sisters make a splash on the big day, whether praised for their styles or ridiculed for their attempts.\n\nLast year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall were the only three to show up on the first Monday in May. The year before, all five sisters and their self-proclaimed \"momager,\" Kris Jenner, attended the Met Gala, marking the first year everyone was invited. Considering Khloe and Kourtney's 2023 absence, fans aren't betting they'll be coming this year. Kim and Kylie are usually mainstays, but as of now, their arrival isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnna Wintour has made her list, checked it twice, and sent out the invites, but who will show up?\n\nEvery year, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has the final say on who will be allowed to grace the red carpet on the first Monday in May for \"fashion's biggest night out\". Of course, we all have our favourites, but they ultimately have to be the British tastemaker's favourites too.\n\nThe four co-chairs - Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - and the four hosts - La La Anthony, Ashley Graham, Gwendoline Christie, and Emma Chamberlain - will be in attendance. According to a Page Six report, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Olivia Rodrigo, Sarah Paulson, and Cara Delevingne will also arrive on 6 May for the annual Met Gala. Additionally, Barry Keoghan, Lily Gladstone, and Ayo Edebiri have allegedly been invited.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n04:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nDespite initial predictions, A-listers and attendees hopefully won't arrive in designer jammies or Disney princess garb. The theme, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" shouldn't be taken literally. Guests will abide by a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing JG Ballard's 1962 story.\n\nBased on the dystopian tale of the dwindling crystalline garden, celebrities should be motivated by natural elements relating to eternal beauty. Florals, rosettes, and live greenery are just a few embellishments expected to be stitched into designer looks on the red carpet. From Loewe's sprouted grass coat to Simone Rocha's chiffon dress with pink stemmed roses, guests will carefully select and craft pieces that model tender cues in nature, while minding a \"passing time\" motif.\n\nThe theme of the 2024 Met Gala, scheduled for 6 May, focuses on bringing archival forms back to life by reimagining them in digital forms. Of course, the unofficial concept of the night will likely be floral galore under a dress code of \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition will feature 250 pieces from The Costume Institute's collection. According to Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in charge of The Costume Institute, Charles Frederick Worth's 1877 silk satin gown was a motivating piece. From there, 50 designs became the center of the exhibit. These pieces are the \"sleeping beauties,\" so fragile they can never be worn again. Textiles and fabrics will be categorised under three zones relating to the environment: land, sea, and sky.\n\nWhat does the 2024 Met Gala theme 'Sleeping Beauties' actually mean?\n\nAllegedly, the 2024 co-chair's outfit is still in production. While many stars are scheduling their final fittings two days before the main event, the Euphoria star's stylist, Law Roach, claimed they haven't even seen her dress yet.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress! We've been on two press tours - Dune 2 and Challengers - and doing two Vogue covers,\" Roach told The New York Times. \"The dress isn't even made. They won't fit until Saturday.\"\n\nLaw Roach reveals Zendaya's Met Gala dress hasn't been made yet\n\nSunday 5 May 2024 22:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nAhead of the big night, Rihanna teased her 2024 Met Gala look, admitting it was a completely different one than she's gone for in the past. The \"Diamonds\" singer plans to make a modest statement.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue, Rihanna confirmed she would be sporting her Fenty brands. \"I'm gonna wear Fenty something! Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, Fenty Savage,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAs for her outfit, fans should expect the unexpected. \"I've done so much sh** in my life. I've had my nipples out, my panties out,\" she admitted. \"But now, those are the things which, I guess as a mum and an evolved young lady - emphasis on young - there are things I feel like I would never do.

The co-chairs for the evening include Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny, while Vogue's red-carpet hosts will be La La Anthony, Gwendoline Christie, and Ashley Graham, alongside special correspondent Emma Chamberlain.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" - which is not a reference the Disney fairytale. Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period. The idea is to reimagine fragile designs that can never be worn again in new ways through CGI, light projections, soundscaping, and video animation.\n\nGuests will follow a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" a nod to JG Ballard's 1962 tale. The story details Count Axel, his Countess, and their dwindling garden as an angry mob descends on their peaceful home and nursery of crystalline flowers.\n\nAlong with all four co-chairs and the event's organiser Anna Wintour, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, Cara Delevingne, and Olivia Rodrigo are expected to be at tonight's Met Gala, according to a 13 April Page Six report.\n\nThe broadcast of the 2024 Met Gala red carpet will begin at 6pm ET, with the event streaming on Vogue's TikTok and YouTube account.\n\n22:13 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAlthough Gigi Hadid has not yet arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she's teasing her look for the night.\n\nThe supermodel has revealed that she will be wearing Thom Browne on the green and white carpet. You can find everything we know about Hadid's look below.\n\nGigi Hadid teases her 'Met prep' with Thom Browne outfit for Met Gala 2024\n\n22:06 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAnna Wintour has officially arrived at the Met Gala. The Vogue editor chose a white and black look for the fashion extravaganza, with Wintour posing on the green and white carpet in a white gown and a black floral-embroidered jacket.\n\nWintour's arrival means the Met Gala is officially underway!\n\n22:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with People, published on 6 May, actor Chase Stokes opened up about being cordially invited to the fashion event. He also specified that when he received the invitation, he was with his girlfriend, Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n\"This is actually a crazy story,\" the Outerbanks star told the publication, as he'll be attending the Met Gala for the first time tonight. \"I had just flown from Morocco to Atlanta to do re-shoots for a movie with Netflix. It was a 26-hour travel day. I worked all day and then I had the next morning to do something. I was on the way to the aquarium with my girlfriend and we got the call. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're going to the Met.'\"\n\nHe added that when he and his partner got the call, it was \"a very wild moment\" that he would \"never, ever forget\".\n\n21:47 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nIt's still early in the night, which means we have hours yet before some of the biggest names grace the steps of The Met. However, fans outside of the museum are hopeful for glimpses of their favourites.\n\nSpeaking to Kaleigh Werner from across the street of the museum, Carly Fox said she is not entirely sure who she's most excited to see tonight, but she's eager to see Zendaya.\n\n\"Definitely Zendaya for sure, but I'm eager to see Sabrina Carpenter,\" she said.\n\nClaire, who also lined up for the chance to see A-listers as they enter the gala, said she's \"hoping to see Taylor Swift\" but she's \"not sure she'll go\".\n\n\"I'm also hoping to see Blake Lively because she's consistently one of my favourite dressed at The Met.\"\n\n21:43 , Amber Raiken\n\nZendaya will be walking the red carpet at the Met Gala tonight, as this is the first time she's attended the event since 2019. During an episode of Live with Kelly & Mark last month, the Euphoria star described why she's nervous about going to the 2024 Met Gala, where she's one of the co-chairs.\n\n\"I first went when I was 18 years old, and Law [Roach] and I, my stylist, we've been working together since I was like 14 years old. But I remember being 18 and it was such an exciting and new experience,\" she said. \"But still terrifying.\"\n\nZendaya continued: \"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years. So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while.\"\n\nZendaya reveals why it's 'terrifying' to go to the Met Gala\n\n21:39 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nThe red carpet has officially begun, with celebrities beginning to make their way to the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nYou can find all of the best-dressed stars on this year's green and white carpet below.\n\nDuring an episode of Today, which aired on 6 May, Jenna Bush Hager opened up about her one-on-one chat with Anna Wintour, leading up to the 2024 Met Gala. She noted that when she took the opportunity to ask Wintour if Taylor Swift would be at the fashion event this year, the Vogue Editor-in-Chief simply responded: \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\"\n\nBush Hager then acknowledged how Wintour's comment left room for interpretation about Swift's attendance, adding: \"So that could be yes, that could be no.\"\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, Wintour's remark came as there have been various reports that Swift won't be at the Met Gala. According to a report shared by TMZ last month, Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, both received invitations to the event, which is in support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's coveted costume institution.\n\nHowever, Swift will not be attending because the gala falls during the same week her Eras Tour will be returning from its break with a concert in Paris. This is no definitive reason why Kelce will not be going to the Met Gala, but TMZ reported he's likely skipping it because his girlfriend won't be there.\n\n21:23 , Kaleigh Werner\n\nWith just a few hours left until attendees begin to arrive on the red carpet, the streets outside of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City have filled with fans eager to see their favourite A-listers.\n\n21:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an appearance on Good Morning America, hours before the Met Gala, event co-chair Jennifer Lopez made a quip about her look for the red carpet. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight, she said: \"Barely, ever.\"\n\nHowever, she expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that lack of mobility, adding: \"The Met gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\n20:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring a conversation with Today host Jenna Bush Hager, aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour confirmed that chives, onion, and garlic are never a part of the food menu at the Met Gala. \"Those are three things I'm not fond of,\" she said.\n\nShe also opened up about cell phone use being banned from inside the gala, specifically during dinner time.\n\n\"It's often wonderful to hear after dinner, people say, 'Oh we had the most wonderful conversations,'\" Wintour said. \"That's the idea, that life can exist without a picture on your cell phone.\n\n19:45 , Amber Raiken\n\nHours before the fashion extravaganza, Marc Jacobs took to Instagram to tease that he'll be styling celebrities at this year's Met Gala. Along with a photo of four black silhouettes on Instagram, the caption of the post reads: \"Can you guess who Marc's dressing for tonight's Met Gala?\"\n\nIn the comments, many fans have gone on to guess which celebrity Jacobs could be styling, such as influencer Alex Consani, YouTube star Emma Chamberlain, model Hailey Bieber, or actor Jenna Ortega.\n\n19:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nFans have lined up outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art this afternoon, in anticipation of celebrities' upcoming arrival at the fashion extravaganza. While outside of the museum in New York City, people were also given pieces of tonight's red carpet, which were green and beige.\n\n18:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with Jenna Bush Hager for Today, which aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour discussed the theme of the 2024 gala: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the inspiration behind its dress code, \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,\" she said. \"When we came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties,' it's wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.\"\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of Vogue recalled that when establishing the theme, she turned to the Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton, for advice on what celebrities could wear. She also acknowledged that amid those conversations about outfits, the public was then confused about that dress code.\n\n\"I said, 'What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?' And he said, 'Well, what about 'Garden of Time?'\" she explained. \"So, I fear that we've unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologise.\"\n\n17:30 , Amber Raiken\n\nOver the weekend, the Metropolitan Museum of Art prepared for its annual fashion extravaganza by setting up its iconic tent, which celebrities step into when entering the gala.\n\nThis year, the front of the white tent includes a graphic of a rose, as it reads: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The tent name is a reference to the theme of the gala, which intends to dig up tangible pieces of history, some of which were put to rest years ago, to motivate conversation about natural elements and emotion, as well as pay homage to the intimacy between a garment and its wearer with the transformative power of current technology.\n\n16:54 , Amber Raiken\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala co-chairs - Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - are guaranteed to be at the event tonight, along, with the gala's hosts and sponsors: Loewe's creative director, Jonathan Anderson and TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAccording to a 13 April Page Sixreport, Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri are two newcomers to the Met Gala invite list this year. Additionally, a source speaking to the outlet said Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps too. Barry Keoghan is said to have gotten an invite for the second year in a row.\n\nWith these select individuals, we can also assume Vogue's two red carpet hosts, La La Anthony and Emma Chamberlain, will be back again.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n16:04 , Amber Raiken\n\nWhenever the Met Gala is held, there are certain guidelines that guests will be expected to follow, should they want to stay in event organiser Anna Wintour's good books. And when we think about all the celebrities attending the event, some rules are a bit unexpected.\n\nFor example, one would think that all who attend an event as glitzy as the Met Gala would be forgiven for taking the odd photograph to capture special moments of the occasion. However, in 2015 it was reported that the use of social media had been banned from the event, to clamp down on celebrities spending the majority of the evening on their phones.\n\nHere are four other surprising rules guests are expected to follow when entering the Met Gala tonight.\n\nAccording to Vogue, invitees to tonight's event are meant to follow the dress code, \"The Garden of Time\" - telling the story of Count Axel, his countess, and their dwindling garden. From this, guests should know to represent fleeting beauty and refrain from wearing princess dress or pajama sets.\n\nHowever, not everyone opts to abide by the dress code's memo. Though the argument that every celebrity look worn to the Met Gala is subjected to criticisms and contrasting opinions, some've come out over the last 25 years that were undeniably a point of contention.\n\nFor example, Kim Kardashian wore one of Marilyn Monroe's iconic dresses to the Met Gala in 2022, prompting immediate controversy. People were angered by the Skims creator's decision to wear the actual dress, a piece that was already so fragile. Some claimed she tore the back of the dress until Ripley's confirmed the garment wasn't at all damaged.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable looks at the Met Gala over the years that were met with intense criticism.\n\nThe most controversial outfits worn to the Met Gala\n\n14:32 , Amber Raiken\n\nVogue will live-stream the highly-anticipated fashion event on its TikTok and YouTube accounts. While the broadcast is expected to begin at 6 pm, some celebrities will walk the red carpet on the museum's iconic steps a bit earlier than that.\n\nIn addition, E! News will also be covering the gala for its Live From E! broadcast tonight. As noted by E! News, the broadcast will \"give a sneak peek at stars' Met Gala 'fits as they depart from The Mark Hotel and The Pierre Hotel\" in New York City. TV host Ross Mathews will also be interviewing celebrities when they arrive at the museum, with the broadcast expected to run from 6 pm ET to 9:30 pm ET.\n\n13:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000. In 2023, the cost was $25,000 less for a single ticket.\n\nThere's no denying the Kardashian-Jenner women are show-stoppers on the Met Gala red carpet. Year after year, the reality TV sisters make a splash on the big day, whether praised for their styles or ridiculed for their attempts.\n\nLast year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall were the only three to show up on the first Monday in May. The year before, all five sisters and their self-proclaimed \"momager,\" Kris Jenner, attended the Met Gala, marking the first year everyone was invited. Considering Khloe and Kourtney's 2023 absence, fans aren't betting they'll be coming this year. Kim and Kylie are usually mainstays, but as of now, their arrival isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnna Wintour has made her list, checked it twice, and sent out the invites, but who will show up?\n\nEvery year, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has the final say on who will be allowed to grace the red carpet on the first Monday in May for \"fashion's biggest night out\". Of course, we all have our favourites, but they ultimately have to be the British tastemaker's favourites too.\n\nThe four co-chairs - Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - and the four hosts - La La Anthony, Ashley Graham, Gwendoline Christie, and Emma Chamberlain - will be in attendance. According to a Page Six report, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Olivia Rodrigo, Sarah Paulson, and Cara Delevingne will also arrive on 6 May for the annual Met Gala. Additionally, Barry Keoghan, Lily Gladstone, and Ayo Edebiri have allegedly been invited.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n04:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nDespite initial predictions, A-listers and attendees hopefully won't arrive in designer jammies or Disney princess garb. The theme, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" shouldn't be taken literally. Guests will abide by a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing JG Ballard's 1962 story.\n\nBased on the dystopian tale of the dwindling crystalline garden, celebrities should be motivated by natural elements relating to eternal beauty. Florals, rosettes, and live greenery are just a few embellishments expected to be stitched into designer looks on the red carpet. From Loewe's sprouted grass coat to Simone Rocha's chiffon dress with pink stemmed roses, guests will carefully select and craft pieces that model tender cues in nature, while minding a \"passing time\" motif.\n\nThe theme of the 2024 Met Gala, scheduled for 6 May, focuses on bringing archival forms back to life by reimagining them in digital forms. Of course, the unofficial concept of the night will likely be floral galore under a dress code of \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition will feature 250 pieces from The Costume Institute's collection. According to Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in charge of The Costume Institute, Charles Frederick Worth's 1877 silk satin gown was a motivating piece. From there, 50 designs became the center of the exhibit. These pieces are the \"sleeping beauties,\" so fragile they can never be worn again. Textiles and fabrics will be categorised under three zones relating to the environment: land, sea, and sky.\n\nWhat does the 2024 Met Gala theme 'Sleeping Beauties' actually mean?\n\nAllegedly, the 2024 co-chair's outfit is still in production. While many stars are scheduling their final fittings two days before the main event, the Euphoria star's stylist, Law Roach, claimed they haven't even seen her dress yet.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress! We've been on two press tours - Dune 2 and Challengers - and doing two Vogue covers,\" Roach told The New York Times. \"The dress isn't even made. They won't fit until Saturday.\"\n\nLaw Roach reveals Zendaya's Met Gala dress hasn't been made yet\n\nSunday 5 May 2024 22:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nAhead of the big night, Rihanna teased her 2024 Met Gala look, admitting it was a completely different one than she's gone for in the past. The \"Diamonds\" singer plans to make a modest statement.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue, Rihanna confirmed she would be sporting her Fenty brands. \"I'm gonna wear Fenty something! Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, Fenty Savage,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAs for her outfit, fans should expect the unexpected. \"I've done so much sh** in my life. I've had my nipples out, my panties out,\" she admitted. \"But now, those are the things which, I guess as a mum and an evolved young lady - emphasis on young - there are things I feel like I would never do. Like: 'Oh my God, I really did that? Nips out?\"\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000.

Of course, the unofficial concept of the night will likely be floral galore under a dress code of \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition will feature 250 pieces from The Costume Institute's collection. According to Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in charge of The Costume Institute, Charles Frederick Worth's 1877 silk satin gown was a motivating piece. From there, 50 designs became the center of the exhibit. These pieces are the \"sleeping beauties,\" so fragile they can never be worn again. Textiles and fabrics will be categorised under three zones relating to the environment: land, sea, and sky.\n\nWhat does the 2024 Met Gala theme 'Sleeping Beauties' actually mean?\n\nSunday 5 May 2024 10:51 , Louis Chilton\n\nFor anyone feeling nostalgic, here's a look back at the best outfits from last year\n\nThe good, the bad and the downright crazy looks from the Met Gala\n\nAllegedly, the 2024 co-chair's outfit is still in production. While many stars are scheduling their final fittings two days before the main event, the Euphoria star's stylist, Law Roach, claimed they haven't even seen her dress yet.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress! We've been on two press tours - Dune 2 and Challengers - and doing two Vogue covers,\" Roach told The New York Times. \"The dress isn't even made. They won't fit until Saturday.\"\n\nLaw Roach reveals Zendaya's Met Gala dress hasn't been made yet\n\nSaturday 4 May 2024 17:45 , Kaleigh Werner\n\nAhead of the big night, Rihanna teased her 2024 Met Gala look, admitting it was a completely different one than she's gone for in the past. The \"Diamonds\" singer plans to make a modest statement.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue, Rihanna confirmed she would be sporting her Fenty brands. \"I'm gonna wear Fenty something! Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, Fenty Savage,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAs for her outfit, fans should expect the unexpected. \"I've done so much sh** in my life. I've had my nipples out, my panties out,\" she admitted. \"But now, those are the things which, I guess as a mum and an evolved young lady - emphasis on young - there are things I feel like I would never do. Like: 'Oh my God, I really did that? Nips out?\"\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000. In 2023, the cost was $25,000 less for a single ticket.\n\nThere's no denying the Kardashian-Jenner women are show-stoppers on the Met Gala red carpet. Year after year, the reality TV sisters make a splash on the big day, whether praised for their styles or ridiculed for their attempts.\n\nLast year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall were the only three to show up on the first Monday in May. The year before, all five sisters and their self-proclaimed \"momager,\" Kris Jenner, attended the Met Gala, marking the first year everyone was invited. Considering Khloe and Kourtney's 2023 absence, fans aren't betting they'll be coming this year. Kim and Kylie are usually mainstays, but as of now, their arrival isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnna Wintour has made her list, checked it twice, and sent out the invites, but who will show up?\n\nEvery year, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has the final say on who will be allowed to grace the red carpet on the first Monday in May for \"fashion's biggest night out\". Of course, we all have our favourites, but they ultimately have to be the British tastemaker's favourites too.\n\nThe four co-chairs - Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - and the four hosts - La La Anthony, Ashley Graham, Gwendoline Christie, and Emma Chamberlain - will be in attendance. According to a Page Six report, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Olivia Rodrigo, Sarah Paulson, and Cara Delevingne will also arrive on 6 May for the annual Met Gala. Additionally, Barry Keoghan, Lily Gladstone, and Ayo Edebiri have allegedly been invited.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The co-chairs for the evening include Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny, while Vogue's red-carpet hosts will be La La Anthony, Gwendoline Christie, and Ashley Graham, alongside special correspondent Emma Chamberlain.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" - which is not a reference the Disney fairytale. Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period. The idea is to reimagine fragile designs that can never be worn again in new ways through CGI, light projections, soundscaping, and video animation.\n\nGuests will follow a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" a nod to JG Ballard's 1962 tale. The story details Count Axel, his Countess, and their dwindling garden as an angry mob descends on their peaceful home and nursery of crystalline flowers.\n\nAlong with all four co-chairs and the event's organiser Anna Wintour, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, Cara Delevingne, and Olivia Rodrigo are expected to be at tonight's Met Gala, according to a 13 April Page Six report.\n\nThe broadcast of the 2024 Met Gala red carpet will begin at 6pm ET, with the event streaming on Vogue's TikTok and YouTube account.\n\n22:13 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAlthough Gigi Hadid has not yet arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she's teasing her look for the night.\n\nThe supermodel has revealed that she will be wearing Thom Browne on the green and white carpet. You can find everything we know about Hadid's look below.\n\nGigi Hadid teases her 'Met prep' with Thom Browne outfit for Met Gala 2024\n\n22:06 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAnna Wintour has officially arrived at the Met Gala. The Vogue editor chose a white and black look for the fashion extravaganza, with Wintour posing on the green and white carpet in a white gown and a black floral-embroidered jacket.\n\nWintour's arrival means the Met Gala is officially underway!\n\n22:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with People, published on 6 May, actor Chase Stokes opened up about being cordially invited to the fashion event. He also specified that when he received the invitation, he was with his girlfriend, Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n\"This is actually a crazy story,\" the Outerbanks star told the publication, as he'll be attending the Met Gala for the first time tonight. \"I had just flown from Morocco to Atlanta to do re-shoots for a movie with Netflix. It was a 26-hour travel day. I worked all day and then I had the next morning to do something. I was on the way to the aquarium with my girlfriend and we got the call. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're going to the Met.'\"\n\nHe added that when he and his partner got the call, it was \"a very wild moment\" that he would \"never, ever forget\".\n\n21:47 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nIt's still early in the night, which means we have hours yet before some of the biggest names grace the steps of The Met. However, fans outside of the museum are hopeful for glimpses of their favourites.\n\nSpeaking to Kaleigh Werner from across the street of the museum, Carly Fox said she is not entirely sure who she's most excited to see tonight, but she's eager to see Zendaya.\n\n\"Definitely Zendaya for sure, but I'm eager to see Sabrina Carpenter,\" she said.\n\nClaire, who also lined up for the chance to see A-listers as they enter the gala, said she's \"hoping to see Taylor Swift\" but she's \"not sure she'll go\".\n\n\"I'm also hoping to see Blake Lively because she's consistently one of my favourite dressed at The Met.\"\n\n21:43 , Amber Raiken\n\nZendaya will be walking the red carpet at the Met Gala tonight, as this is the first time she's attended the event since 2019. During an episode of Live with Kelly & Mark last month, the Euphoria star described why she's nervous about going to the 2024 Met Gala, where she's one of the co-chairs.\n\n\"I first went when I was 18 years old, and Law [Roach] and I, my stylist, we've been working together since I was like 14 years old. But I remember being 18 and it was such an exciting and new experience,\" she said. \"But still terrifying.\"\n\nZendaya continued: \"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years. So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while.\"\n\nZendaya reveals why it's 'terrifying' to go to the Met Gala\n\n21:39 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nThe red carpet has officially begun, with celebrities beginning to make their way to the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nYou can find all of the best-dressed stars on this year's green and white carpet below.\n\nDuring an episode of Today, which aired on 6 May, Jenna Bush Hager opened up about her one-on-one chat with Anna Wintour, leading up to the 2024 Met Gala. She noted that when she took the opportunity to ask Wintour if Taylor Swift would be at the fashion event this year, the Vogue Editor-in-Chief simply responded: \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\"\n\nBush Hager then acknowledged how Wintour's comment left room for interpretation about Swift's attendance, adding: \"So that could be yes, that could be no.\"\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, Wintour's remark came as there have been various reports that Swift won't be at the Met Gala. According to a report shared by TMZ last month, Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, both received invitations to the event, which is in support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's coveted costume institution.\n\nHowever, Swift will not be attending because the gala falls during the same week her Eras Tour will be returning from its break with a concert in Paris. This is no definitive reason why Kelce will not be going to the Met Gala, but TMZ reported he's likely skipping it because his girlfriend won't be there.\n\n21:23 , Kaleigh Werner\n\nWith just a few hours left until attendees begin to arrive on the red carpet, the streets outside of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City have filled with fans eager to see their favourite A-listers.\n\n21:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an appearance on Good Morning America, hours before the Met Gala, event co-chair Jennifer Lopez made a quip about her look for the red carpet. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight, she said: \"Barely, ever.\"\n\nHowever, she expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that lack of mobility, adding: \"The Met gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\n20:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring a conversation with Today host Jenna Bush Hager, aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour confirmed that chives, onion, and garlic are never a part of the food menu at the Met Gala. \"Those are three things I'm not fond of,\" she said.\n\nShe also opened up about cell phone use being banned from inside the gala, specifically during dinner time.\n\n\"It's often wonderful to hear after dinner, people say, 'Oh we had the most wonderful conversations,'\" Wintour said. \"That's the idea, that life can exist without a picture on your cell phone.\n\n19:45 , Amber Raiken\n\nHours before the fashion extravaganza, Marc Jacobs took to Instagram to tease that he'll be styling celebrities at this year's Met Gala. Along with a photo of four black silhouettes on Instagram, the caption of the post reads: \"Can you guess who Marc's dressing for tonight's Met Gala?\"\n\nIn the comments, many fans have gone on to guess which celebrity Jacobs could be styling, such as influencer Alex Consani, YouTube star Emma Chamberlain, model Hailey Bieber, or actor Jenna Ortega.\n\n19:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nFans have lined up outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art this afternoon, in anticipation of celebrities' upcoming arrival at the fashion extravaganza. While outside of the museum in New York City, people were also given pieces of tonight's red carpet, which were green and beige.\n\n18:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with Jenna Bush Hager for Today, which aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour discussed the theme of the 2024 gala: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the inspiration behind its dress code, \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,\" she said. \"When we came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties,' it's wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.\"\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of Vogue recalled that when establishing the theme, she turned to the Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton, for advice on what celebrities could wear. She also acknowledged that amid those conversations about outfits, the public was then confused about that dress code.\n\n\"I said, 'What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?' And he said, 'Well, what about 'Garden of Time?'\" she explained. \"So, I fear that we've unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologise.\"\n\n17:30 , Amber Raiken\n\nOver the weekend, the Metropolitan Museum of Art prepared for its annual fashion extravaganza by setting up its iconic tent, which celebrities step into when entering the gala.\n\nThis year, the front of the white tent includes a graphic of a rose, as it reads: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The tent name is a reference to the theme of the gala, which intends to dig up tangible pieces of history, some of which were put to rest years ago, to motivate conversation about natural elements and emotion, as well as pay homage to the intimacy between a garment and its wearer with the transformative power of current technology.\n\n16:54 , Amber Raiken\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala co-chairs - Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - are guaranteed to be at the event tonight, along, with the gala's hosts and sponsors: Loewe's creative director, Jonathan Anderson and TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAccording to a 13 April Page Sixreport, Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri are two newcomers to the Met Gala invite list this year. Additionally, a source speaking to the outlet said Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps too. Barry Keoghan is said to have gotten an invite for the second year in a row.\n\nWith these select individuals, we can also assume Vogue's two red carpet hosts, La La Anthony and Emma Chamberlain, will be back again.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n16:04 , Amber Raiken\n\nWhenever the Met Gala is held, there are certain guidelines that guests will be expected to follow, should they want to stay in event organiser Anna Wintour's good books. And when we think about all the celebrities attending the event, some rules are a bit unexpected.\n\nFor example, one would think that all who attend an event as glitzy as the Met Gala would be forgiven for taking the odd photograph to capture special moments of the occasion. However, in 2015 it was reported that the use of social media had been banned from the event, to clamp down on celebrities spending the majority of the evening on their phones.\n\nHere are four other surprising rules guests are expected to follow when entering the Met Gala tonight.\n\nAccording to Vogue, invitees to tonight's event are meant to follow the dress code, \"The Garden of Time\" - telling the story of Count Axel, his countess, and their dwindling garden. From this, guests should know to represent fleeting beauty and refrain from wearing princess dress or pajama sets.\n\nHowever, not everyone opts to abide by the dress code's memo. Though the argument that every celebrity look worn to the Met Gala is subjected to criticisms and contrasting opinions, some've come out over the last 25 years that were undeniably a point of contention.\n\nFor example, Kim Kardashian wore one of Marilyn Monroe's iconic dresses to the Met Gala in 2022, prompting immediate controversy. People were angered by the Skims creator's decision to wear the actual dress, a piece that was already so fragile. Some claimed she tore the back of the dress until Ripley's confirmed the garment wasn't at all damaged.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable looks at the Met Gala over the years that were met with intense criticism.\n\nThe most controversial outfits worn to the Met Gala\n\n14:32 , Amber Raiken\n\nVogue will live-stream the highly-anticipated fashion event on its TikTok and YouTube accounts. While the broadcast is expected to begin at 6 pm, some celebrities will walk the red carpet on the museum's iconic steps a bit earlier than that.\n\nIn addition, E! News will also be covering the gala for its Live From E! broadcast tonight. As noted by E! News, the broadcast will \"give a sneak peek at stars' Met Gala 'fits as they depart from The Mark Hotel and The Pierre Hotel\" in New York City. TV host Ross Mathews will also be interviewing celebrities when they arrive at the museum, with the broadcast expected to run from 6 pm ET to 9:30 pm ET.\n\n13:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000. In 2023, the cost was $25,000 less for a single ticket.\n\nThere's no denying the Kardashian-Jenner women are show-stoppers on the Met Gala red carpet. Year after year, the reality TV sisters make a splash on the big day, whether praised for their styles or ridiculed for their attempts.\n\nLast year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall were the only three to show up on the first Monday in May. The year before, all five sisters and their self-proclaimed \"momager,\" Kris Jenner, attended the Met Gala, marking the first year everyone was invited. Considering Khloe and Kourtney's 2023 absence, fans aren't betting they'll be coming this year. Kim and Kylie are usually mainstays, but as of now, their arrival isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnna Wintour has made her list, checked it twice, and sent out the invites, but who will show up?\n\nEvery year, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has the final say on who will be allowed to grace the red carpet on the first Monday in May for \"fashion's biggest night out\". Of course, we all have our favourites, but they ultimately have to be the British tastemaker's favourites too.\n\nThe four co-chairs - Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - and the four hosts - La La Anthony, Ashley Graham, Gwendoline Christie, and Emma Chamberlain - will be in attendance. According to a Page Six report, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Olivia Rodrigo, Sarah Paulson, and Cara Delevingne will also arrive on 6 May for the annual Met Gala. Additionally, Barry Keoghan, Lily Gladstone, and Ayo Edebiri have allegedly been invited.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n04:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nDespite initial predictions, A-listers and attendees hopefully won't arrive in designer jammies or Disney princess garb.

The co-chairs for the evening include Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny, while Vogue's red-carpet hosts will be La La Anthony, Gwendoline Christie, and Ashley Graham, alongside special correspondent Emma Chamberlain.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" - which is not a reference the Disney fairytale. Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period. The idea is to reimagine fragile designs that can never be worn again in new ways through CGI, light projections, soundscaping, and video animation.\n\nGuests will follow a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" a nod to JG Ballard's 1962 tale. The story details Count Axel, his Countess, and their dwindling garden as an angry mob descends on their peaceful home and nursery of crystalline flowers.\n\nAlong with all four co-chairs and the event's organiser Anna Wintour, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, Cara Delevingne, and Olivia Rodrigo are expected to be at tonight's Met Gala, according to a 13 April Page Six report.\n\nThe broadcast of the 2024 Met Gala red carpet will begin at 6pm ET, with the event streaming on Vogue's TikTok and YouTube account.\n\n22:13 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAlthough Gigi Hadid has not yet arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she's teasing her look for the night.\n\nThe supermodel has revealed that she will be wearing Thom Browne on the green and white carpet.

The Vogue editor chose a white and black look for the fashion extravaganza, with Wintour posing on the green and white carpet in a white gown and a black floral-embroidered jacket.\n\nWintour's arrival means the Met Gala is officially underway!\n\n22:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with People, published on 6 May, actor Chase Stokes opened up about being cordially invited to the fashion event. He also specified that when he received the invitation, he was with his girlfriend, Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n\"This is actually a crazy story,\" the Outerbanks star told the publication, as he'll be attending the Met Gala for the first time tonight. \"I had just flown from Morocco to Atlanta to do re-shoots for a movie with Netflix. It was a 26-hour travel day. I worked all day and then I had the next morning to do something. I was on the way to the aquarium with my girlfriend and we got the call. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're going to the Met.'\"\n\nHe added that when he and his partner got the call, it was \"a very wild moment\" that he would \"never, ever forget\".\n\n21:47 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nIt's still early in the night, which means we have hours yet before some of the biggest names grace the steps of The Met. However, fans outside of the museum are hopeful for glimpses of their favourites.\n\nSpeaking to Kaleigh Werner from across the street of the museum, Carly Fox said she is not entirely sure who she's most excited to see tonight, but she's eager to see Zendaya.\n\n\"Definitely Zendaya for sure, but I'm eager to see Sabrina Carpenter,\" she said.\n\nClaire, who also lined up for the chance to see A-listers as they enter the gala, said she's \"hoping to see Taylor Swift\" but she's \"not sure she'll go\".\n\n\"I'm also hoping to see Blake Lively because she's consistently one of my favourite dressed at The Met.\"\n\n21:43 , Amber Raiken\n\nZendaya will be walking the red carpet at the Met Gala tonight, as this is the first time she's attended the event since 2019. During an episode of Live with Kelly & Mark last month, the Euphoria star described why she's nervous about going to the 2024 Met Gala, where she's one of the co-chairs.\n\n\"I first went when I was 18 years old, and Law [Roach] and I, my stylist, we've been working together since I was like 14 years old. But I remember being 18 and it was such an exciting and new experience,\" she said. \"But still terrifying.\"\n\nZendaya continued: \"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years. So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while.\"\n\nZendaya reveals why it's 'terrifying' to go to the Met Gala\n\n21:39 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nThe red carpet has officially begun, with celebrities beginning to make their way to the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nYou can find all of the best-dressed stars on this year's green and white carpet below.\n\nDuring an episode of Today, which aired on 6 May, Jenna Bush Hager opened up about her one-on-one chat with Anna Wintour, leading up to the 2024 Met Gala. She noted that when she took the opportunity to ask Wintour if Taylor Swift would be at the fashion event this year, the Vogue Editor-in-Chief simply responded: \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\"\n\nBush Hager then acknowledged how Wintour's comment left room for interpretation about Swift's attendance, adding: \"So that could be yes, that could be no.\"\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, Wintour's remark came as there have been various reports that Swift won't be at the Met Gala. According to a report shared by TMZ last month, Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, both received invitations to the event, which is in support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's coveted costume institution.\n\nHowever, Swift will not be attending because the gala falls during the same week her Eras Tour will be returning from its break with a concert in Paris. This is no definitive reason why Kelce will not be going to the Met Gala, but TMZ reported he's likely skipping it because his girlfriend won't be there.\n\n21:23 , Kaleigh Werner\n\nWith just a few hours left until attendees begin to arrive on the red carpet, the streets outside of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City have filled with fans eager to see their favourite A-listers.\n\n21:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an appearance on Good Morning America, hours before the Met Gala, event co-chair Jennifer Lopez made a quip about her look for the red carpet. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight, she said: \"Barely, ever.\"\n\nHowever, she expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that lack of mobility, adding: \"The Met gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\n20:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring a conversation with Today host Jenna Bush Hager, aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour confirmed that chives, onion, and garlic are never a part of the food menu at the Met Gala. \"Those are three things I'm not fond of,\" she said.\n\nShe also opened up about cell phone use being banned from inside the gala, specifically during dinner time.\n\n\"It's often wonderful to hear after dinner, people say, 'Oh we had the most wonderful conversations,'\" Wintour said. \"That's the idea, that life can exist without a picture on your cell phone.\n\n19:45 , Amber Raiken\n\nHours before the fashion extravaganza, Marc Jacobs took to Instagram to tease that he'll be styling celebrities at this year's Met Gala. Along with a photo of four black silhouettes on Instagram, the caption of the post reads: \"Can you guess who Marc's dressing for tonight's Met Gala?\"\n\nIn the comments, many fans have gone on to guess which celebrity Jacobs could be styling, such as influencer Alex Consani, YouTube star Emma Chamberlain, model Hailey Bieber, or actor Jenna Ortega.\n\n19:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nFans have lined up outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art this afternoon, in anticipation of celebrities' upcoming arrival at the fashion extravaganza. While outside of the museum in New York City, people were also given pieces of tonight's red carpet, which were green and beige.\n\n18:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with Jenna Bush Hager for Today, which aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour discussed the theme of the 2024 gala: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the inspiration behind its dress code, \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,\" she said. \"When we came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties,' it's wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.\"\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of Vogue recalled that when establishing the theme, she turned to the Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton, for advice on what celebrities could wear. She also acknowledged that amid those conversations about outfits, the public was then confused about that dress code.\n\n\"I said, 'What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?' And he said, 'Well, what about 'Garden of Time?'\" she explained. \"So, I fear that we've unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologise.\"\n\n17:30 , Amber Raiken\n\nOver the weekend, the Metropolitan Museum of Art prepared for its annual fashion extravaganza by setting up its iconic tent, which celebrities step into when entering the gala.\n\nThis year, the front of the white tent includes a graphic of a rose, as it reads: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The tent name is a reference to the theme of the gala, which intends to dig up tangible pieces of history, some of which were put to rest years ago, to motivate conversation about natural elements and emotion, as well as pay homage to the intimacy between a garment and its wearer with the transformative power of current technology.\n\n16:54 , Amber Raiken\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala co-chairs - Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - are guaranteed to be at the event tonight, along, with the gala's hosts and sponsors: Loewe's creative director, Jonathan Anderson and TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAccording to a 13 April Page Sixreport, Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri are two newcomers to the Met Gala invite list this year. Additionally, a source speaking to the outlet said Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps too. Barry Keoghan is said to have gotten an invite for the second year in a row.\n\nWith these select individuals, we can also assume Vogue's two red carpet hosts, La La Anthony and Emma Chamberlain, will be back again.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n16:04 , Amber Raiken\n\nWhenever the Met Gala is held, there are certain guidelines that guests will be expected to follow, should they want to stay in event organiser Anna Wintour's good books. And when we think about all the celebrities attending the event, some rules are a bit unexpected.\n\nFor example, one would think that all who attend an event as glitzy as the Met Gala would be forgiven for taking the odd photograph to capture special moments of the occasion. However, in 2015 it was reported that the use of social media had been banned from the event, to clamp down on celebrities spending the majority of the evening on their phones.\n\nHere are four other surprising rules guests are expected to follow when entering the Met Gala tonight.\n\nAccording to Vogue, invitees to tonight's event are meant to follow the dress code, \"The Garden of Time\" - telling the story of Count Axel, his countess, and their dwindling garden. From this, guests should know to represent fleeting beauty and refrain from wearing princess dress or pajama sets.\n\nHowever, not everyone opts to abide by the dress code's memo. Though the argument that every celebrity look worn to the Met Gala is subjected to criticisms and contrasting opinions, some've come out over the last 25 years that were undeniably a point of contention.\n\nFor example, Kim Kardashian wore one of Marilyn Monroe's iconic dresses to the Met Gala in 2022, prompting immediate controversy. People were angered by the Skims creator's decision to wear the actual dress, a piece that was already so fragile. Some claimed she tore the back of the dress until Ripley's confirmed the garment wasn't at all damaged.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable looks at the Met Gala over the years that were met with intense criticism.\n\nThe most controversial outfits worn to the Met Gala\n\n14:32 , Amber Raiken\n\nVogue will live-stream the highly-anticipated fashion event on its TikTok and YouTube accounts. While the broadcast is expected to begin at 6 pm, some celebrities will walk the red carpet on the museum's iconic steps a bit earlier than that.\n\nIn addition, E! News will also be covering the gala for its Live From E! broadcast tonight. As noted by E! News, the broadcast will \"give a sneak peek at stars' Met Gala 'fits as they depart from The Mark Hotel and The Pierre Hotel\" in New York City. TV host Ross Mathews will also be interviewing celebrities when they arrive at the museum, with the broadcast expected to run from 6 pm ET to 9:30 pm ET.\n\n13:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000. In 2023, the cost was $25,000 less for a single ticket.\n\nThere's no denying the Kardashian-Jenner women are show-stoppers on the Met Gala red carpet. Year after year, the reality TV sisters make a splash on the big day, whether praised for their styles or ridiculed for their attempts.\n\nLast year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall were the only three to show up on the first Monday in May. The year before, all five sisters and their self-proclaimed \"momager,\" Kris Jenner, attended the Met Gala, marking the first year everyone was invited. Considering Khloe and Kourtney's 2023 absence, fans aren't betting they'll be coming this year. Kim and Kylie are usually mainstays, but as of now, their arrival isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnna Wintour has made her list, checked it twice, and sent out the invites, but who will show up?\n\nEvery year, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has the final say on who will be allowed to grace the red carpet on the first Monday in May for \"fashion's biggest night out\". Of course, we all have our favourites, but they ultimately have to be the British tastemaker's favourites too.\n\nThe four co-chairs - Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - and the four hosts - La La Anthony, Ashley Graham, Gwendoline Christie, and Emma Chamberlain - will be in attendance. According to a Page Six report, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Olivia Rodrigo, Sarah Paulson, and Cara Delevingne will also arrive on 6 May for the annual Met Gala. Additionally, Barry Keoghan, Lily Gladstone, and Ayo Edebiri have allegedly been invited.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n04:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nDespite initial predictions, A-listers and attendees hopefully won't arrive in designer jammies or Disney princess garb. The theme, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" shouldn't be taken literally. Guests will abide by a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing JG Ballard's 1962 story.\n\nBased on the dystopian tale of the dwindling crystalline garden, celebrities should be motivated by natural elements relating to eternal beauty. Florals, rosettes, and live greenery are just a few embellishments expected to be stitched into designer looks on the red carpet. From Loewe's sprouted grass coat to Simone Rocha's chiffon dress with pink stemmed roses, guests will carefully select and craft pieces that model tender cues in nature, while minding a \"passing time\" motif.\n\nThe theme of the 2024 Met Gala, scheduled for 6 May, focuses on bringing archival forms back to life by reimagining them in digital forms. Of course, the unofficial concept of the night will likely be floral galore under a dress code of \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition will feature 250 pieces from The Costume Institute's collection. According to Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in charge of The Costume Institute, Charles Frederick Worth's 1877 silk satin gown was a motivating piece. From there, 50 designs became the center of the exhibit. These pieces are the \"sleeping beauties,\" so fragile they can never be worn again. Textiles and fabrics will be categorised under three zones relating to the environment: land, sea, and sky.\n\nWhat does the 2024 Met Gala theme 'Sleeping Beauties' actually mean?\n\nAllegedly, the 2024 co-chair's outfit is still in production. While many stars are scheduling their final fittings two days before the main event, the Euphoria star's stylist, Law Roach, claimed they haven't even seen her dress yet.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress! We've been on two press tours - Dune 2 and Challengers - and doing two Vogue covers,\" Roach told The New York Times. \"The dress isn't even made. They won't fit until Saturday.\"\n\nLaw Roach reveals Zendaya's Met Gala dress hasn't been made yet\n\nSunday 5 May 2024 22:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nAhead of the big night, Rihanna teased her 2024 Met Gala look, admitting it was a completely different one than she's gone for in the past. The \"Diamonds\" singer plans to make a modest statement.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue, Rihanna confirmed she would be sporting her Fenty brands. \"I'm gonna wear Fenty something! Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, Fenty Savage,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAs for her outfit, fans should expect the unexpected. \"I've done so much sh** in my life. I've had my nipples out, my panties out,\" she admitted. \"But now, those are the things which, I guess as a mum and an evolved young lady - emphasis on young - there are things I feel like I would never do.

The co-chairs for the evening include Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny, while Vogue's red-carpet hosts will be La La Anthony, Gwendoline Christie, and Ashley Graham, alongside special correspondent Emma Chamberlain.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" - which is not a reference the Disney fairytale. Inside the exhibit, 250 pieces from the Costume Institute's permanent collection will be showcased, some dating back to the Elizabethan period. The idea is to reimagine fragile designs that can never be worn again in new ways through CGI, light projections, soundscaping, and video animation.\n\nGuests will follow a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" a nod to JG Ballard's 1962 tale. The story details Count Axel, his Countess, and their dwindling garden as an angry mob descends on their peaceful home and nursery of crystalline flowers.\n\nAlong with all four co-chairs and the event's organiser Anna Wintour, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Sarah Paulson, Cara Delevingne, and Olivia Rodrigo are expected to be at tonight's Met Gala, according to a 13 April Page Six report.\n\nThe broadcast of the 2024 Met Gala red carpet will begin at 6pm ET, with the event streaming on Vogue's TikTok and YouTube account.\n\n22:13 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nAlthough Gigi Hadid has not yet arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she's teasing her look for the night.\n\nThe supermodel has revealed that she will be wearing Thom Browne on the green and white carpet.

He also specified that when he received the invitation, he was with his girlfriend, Kelsea Ballerini.\n\n\"This is actually a crazy story,\" the Outerbanks star told the publication, as he'll be attending the Met Gala for the first time tonight. \"I had just flown from Morocco to Atlanta to do re-shoots for a movie with Netflix. It was a 26-hour travel day. I worked all day and then I had the next morning to do something. I was on the way to the aquarium with my girlfriend and we got the call. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're going to the Met.'\"\n\nHe added that when he and his partner got the call, it was \"a very wild moment\" that he would \"never, ever forget\".\n\n21:47 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nIt's still early in the night, which means we have hours yet before some of the biggest names grace the steps of The Met. However, fans outside of the museum are hopeful for glimpses of their favourites.\n\nSpeaking to Kaleigh Werner from across the street of the museum, Carly Fox said she is not entirely sure who she's most excited to see tonight, but she's eager to see Zendaya.\n\n\"Definitely Zendaya for sure, but I'm eager to see Sabrina Carpenter,\" she said.\n\nClaire, who also lined up for the chance to see A-listers as they enter the gala, said she's \"hoping to see Taylor Swift\" but she's \"not sure she'll go\".\n\n\"I'm also hoping to see Blake Lively because she's consistently one of my favourite dressed at The Met.\"\n\n21:43 , Amber Raiken\n\nZendaya will be walking the red carpet at the Met Gala tonight, as this is the first time she's attended the event since 2019. During an episode of Live with Kelly & Mark last month, the Euphoria star described why she's nervous about going to the 2024 Met Gala, where she's one of the co-chairs.\n\n\"I first went when I was 18 years old, and Law [Roach] and I, my stylist, we've been working together since I was like 14 years old. But I remember being 18 and it was such an exciting and new experience,\" she said. \"But still terrifying.\"\n\nZendaya continued: \"Going up the steps is very daunting, and I haven't been back for maybe four or five years. So this is, like, my first time back at the Met in quite a while.\"\n\nZendaya reveals why it's 'terrifying' to go to the Met Gala\n\n21:39 , Chelsea Ritschel\n\nThe red carpet has officially begun, with celebrities beginning to make their way to the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nYou can find all of the best-dressed stars on this year's green and white carpet below.\n\nDuring an episode of Today, which aired on 6 May, Jenna Bush Hager opened up about her one-on-one chat with Anna Wintour, leading up to the 2024 Met Gala. She noted that when she took the opportunity to ask Wintour if Taylor Swift would be at the fashion event this year, the Vogue Editor-in-Chief simply responded: \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\"\n\nBush Hager then acknowledged how Wintour's comment left room for interpretation about Swift's attendance, adding: \"So that could be yes, that could be no.\"\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, Wintour's remark came as there have been various reports that Swift won't be at the Met Gala. According to a report shared by TMZ last month, Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, both received invitations to the event, which is in support of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's coveted costume institution.\n\nHowever, Swift will not be attending because the gala falls during the same week her Eras Tour will be returning from its break with a concert in Paris. This is no definitive reason why Kelce will not be going to the Met Gala, but TMZ reported he's likely skipping it because his girlfriend won't be there.\n\n21:23 , Kaleigh Werner\n\nWith just a few hours left until attendees begin to arrive on the red carpet, the streets outside of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City have filled with fans eager to see their favourite A-listers.\n\n21:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an appearance on Good Morning America, hours before the Met Gala, event co-chair Jennifer Lopez made a quip about her look for the red carpet. When asked if she'll be able to walk in her outfit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tonight, she said: \"Barely, ever.\"\n\nHowever, she expressed that she didn't necessarily have an issue with that lack of mobility, adding: \"The Met gala looks...are not about comfort.\"\n\n20:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring a conversation with Today host Jenna Bush Hager, aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour confirmed that chives, onion, and garlic are never a part of the food menu at the Met Gala. \"Those are three things I'm not fond of,\" she said.\n\nShe also opened up about cell phone use being banned from inside the gala, specifically during dinner time.\n\n\"It's often wonderful to hear after dinner, people say, 'Oh we had the most wonderful conversations,'\" Wintour said. \"That's the idea, that life can exist without a picture on your cell phone.\n\n19:45 , Amber Raiken\n\nHours before the fashion extravaganza, Marc Jacobs took to Instagram to tease that he'll be styling celebrities at this year's Met Gala. Along with a photo of four black silhouettes on Instagram, the caption of the post reads: \"Can you guess who Marc's dressing for tonight's Met Gala?\"\n\nIn the comments, many fans have gone on to guess which celebrity Jacobs could be styling, such as influencer Alex Consani, YouTube star Emma Chamberlain, model Hailey Bieber, or actor Jenna Ortega.\n\n19:00 , Amber Raiken\n\nFans have lined up outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art this afternoon, in anticipation of celebrities' upcoming arrival at the fashion extravaganza. While outside of the museum in New York City, people were also given pieces of tonight's red carpet, which were green and beige.\n\n18:15 , Amber Raiken\n\nDuring an interview with Jenna Bush Hager for Today, which aired on 6 May, Anna Wintour discussed the theme of the 2024 gala: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the inspiration behind its dress code, \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\n\"This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,\" she said. \"When we came up with the title 'Sleeping Beauties,' it's wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.\"\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of Vogue recalled that when establishing the theme, she turned to the Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton, for advice on what celebrities could wear. She also acknowledged that amid those conversations about outfits, the public was then confused about that dress code.\n\n\"I said, 'What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?' And he said, 'Well, what about 'Garden of Time?'\" she explained. \"So, I fear that we've unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologise.\"\n\n17:30 , Amber Raiken\n\nOver the weekend, the Metropolitan Museum of Art prepared for its annual fashion extravaganza by setting up its iconic tent, which celebrities step into when entering the gala.\n\nThis year, the front of the white tent includes a graphic of a rose, as it reads: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\" The tent name is a reference to the theme of the gala, which intends to dig up tangible pieces of history, some of which were put to rest years ago, to motivate conversation about natural elements and emotion, as well as pay homage to the intimacy between a garment and its wearer with the transformative power of current technology.\n\n16:54 , Amber Raiken\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala co-chairs - Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - are guaranteed to be at the event tonight, along, with the gala's hosts and sponsors: Loewe's creative director, Jonathan Anderson and TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAccording to a 13 April Page Sixreport, Lily Gladstone and Ayo Edebiri are two newcomers to the Met Gala invite list this year. Additionally, a source speaking to the outlet said Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Cara Delevingne, Sarah Paulson, and Olivia Rodrigo will be gracing the Met steps too. Barry Keoghan is said to have gotten an invite for the second year in a row.\n\nWith these select individuals, we can also assume Vogue's two red carpet hosts, La La Anthony and Emma Chamberlain, will be back again.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n16:04 , Amber Raiken\n\nWhenever the Met Gala is held, there are certain guidelines that guests will be expected to follow, should they want to stay in event organiser Anna Wintour's good books. And when we think about all the celebrities attending the event, some rules are a bit unexpected.\n\nFor example, one would think that all who attend an event as glitzy as the Met Gala would be forgiven for taking the odd photograph to capture special moments of the occasion. However, in 2015 it was reported that the use of social media had been banned from the event, to clamp down on celebrities spending the majority of the evening on their phones.\n\nHere are four other surprising rules guests are expected to follow when entering the Met Gala tonight.\n\nAccording to Vogue, invitees to tonight's event are meant to follow the dress code, \"The Garden of Time\" - telling the story of Count Axel, his countess, and their dwindling garden. From this, guests should know to represent fleeting beauty and refrain from wearing princess dress or pajama sets.\n\nHowever, not everyone opts to abide by the dress code's memo. Though the argument that every celebrity look worn to the Met Gala is subjected to criticisms and contrasting opinions, some've come out over the last 25 years that were undeniably a point of contention.\n\nFor example, Kim Kardashian wore one of Marilyn Monroe's iconic dresses to the Met Gala in 2022, prompting immediate controversy. People were angered by the Skims creator's decision to wear the actual dress, a piece that was already so fragile. Some claimed she tore the back of the dress until Ripley's confirmed the garment wasn't at all damaged.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable looks at the Met Gala over the years that were met with intense criticism.\n\nThe most controversial outfits worn to the Met Gala\n\n14:32 , Amber Raiken\n\nVogue will live-stream the highly-anticipated fashion event on its TikTok and YouTube accounts. While the broadcast is expected to begin at 6 pm, some celebrities will walk the red carpet on the museum's iconic steps a bit earlier than that.\n\nIn addition, E! News will also be covering the gala for its Live From E! broadcast tonight. As noted by E! News, the broadcast will \"give a sneak peek at stars' Met Gala 'fits as they depart from The Mark Hotel and The Pierre Hotel\" in New York City. TV host Ross Mathews will also be interviewing celebrities when they arrive at the museum, with the broadcast expected to run from 6 pm ET to 9:30 pm ET.\n\n13:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nWhile some may argue Anna Wintour's mandated approval makes the Met Gala one of the most exclusive events, the hefty \"cover fee\" makes it even more restrictive.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reported a single ticket price was $75,000, while the cost of a table was at a minimum of $350,000. In 2023, the cost was $25,000 less for a single ticket.\n\nThere's no denying the Kardashian-Jenner women are show-stoppers on the Met Gala red carpet. Year after year, the reality TV sisters make a splash on the big day, whether praised for their styles or ridiculed for their attempts.\n\nLast year, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall were the only three to show up on the first Monday in May. The year before, all five sisters and their self-proclaimed \"momager,\" Kris Jenner, attended the Met Gala, marking the first year everyone was invited. Considering Khloe and Kourtney's 2023 absence, fans aren't betting they'll be coming this year. Kim and Kylie are usually mainstays, but as of now, their arrival isn't guaranteed.\n\nAnna Wintour has made her list, checked it twice, and sent out the invites, but who will show up?\n\nEvery year, the editor-in-chief of Vogue has the final say on who will be allowed to grace the red carpet on the first Monday in May for \"fashion's biggest night out\". Of course, we all have our favourites, but they ultimately have to be the British tastemaker's favourites too.\n\nThe four co-chairs - Zendaya, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, and Bad Bunny - and the four hosts - La La Anthony, Ashley Graham, Gwendoline Christie, and Emma Chamberlain - will be in attendance. According to a Page Six report, Kendall Jenner, Uma Thurman, Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Olivia Rodrigo, Sarah Paulson, and Cara Delevingne will also arrive on 6 May for the annual Met Gala. Additionally, Barry Keoghan, Lily Gladstone, and Ayo Edebiri have allegedly been invited.\n\nWho is going to the 2024 Met Gala and who will skip the event?\n\n04:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nDespite initial predictions, A-listers and attendees hopefully won't arrive in designer jammies or Disney princess garb. The theme, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" shouldn't be taken literally. Guests will abide by a dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" referencing JG Ballard's 1962 story.\n\nBased on the dystopian tale of the dwindling crystalline garden, celebrities should be motivated by natural elements relating to eternal beauty. Florals, rosettes, and live greenery are just a few embellishments expected to be stitched into designer looks on the red carpet. From Loewe's sprouted grass coat to Simone Rocha's chiffon dress with pink stemmed roses, guests will carefully select and craft pieces that model tender cues in nature, while minding a \"passing time\" motif.\n\nThe theme of the 2024 Met Gala, scheduled for 6 May, focuses on bringing archival forms back to life by reimagining them in digital forms. Of course, the unofficial concept of the night will likely be floral galore under a dress code of \"The Garden of Time\".\n\nThe \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition will feature 250 pieces from The Costume Institute's collection. According to Andrew Bolton, Wendy Yu Curator in charge of The Costume Institute, Charles Frederick Worth's 1877 silk satin gown was a motivating piece. From there, 50 designs became the center of the exhibit. These pieces are the \"sleeping beauties,\" so fragile they can never be worn again. Textiles and fabrics will be categorised under three zones relating to the environment: land, sea, and sky.\n\nWhat does the 2024 Met Gala theme 'Sleeping Beauties' actually mean?\n\nAllegedly, the 2024 co-chair's outfit is still in production. While many stars are scheduling their final fittings two days before the main event, the Euphoria star's stylist, Law Roach, claimed they haven't even seen her dress yet.\n\n\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress! We've been on two press tours - Dune 2 and Challengers - and doing two Vogue covers,\" Roach told The New York Times. \"The dress isn't even made. They won't fit until Saturday.\"\n\nLaw Roach reveals Zendaya's Met Gala dress hasn't been made yet\n\nSunday 5 May 2024 22:30 , kaleigh werner\n\nAhead of the big night, Rihanna teased her 2024 Met Gala look, admitting it was a completely different one than she's gone for in the past. The \"Diamonds\" singer plans to make a modest statement.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue, Rihanna confirmed she would be sporting her Fenty brands. \"I'm gonna wear Fenty something! Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, Fenty Savage,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAs for her outfit, fans should expect the unexpected. \"I've done so much sh** in my life. I've had my nipples out, my panties out,\" she admitted. \"But now, those are the things which, I guess as a mum and an evolved young lady - emphasis on young - there are things I feel like I would never do.

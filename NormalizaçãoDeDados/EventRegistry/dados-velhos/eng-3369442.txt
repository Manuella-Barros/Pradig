Komen foundation all said Friday they're canceling events at Trump's Palm Beach property Mar-a-Lago. That comes after three organizations made similar announcements on Thursday.\n\nThe cancellations follow the spectacular implosion of Trump's business councils this week over the president's insistence that counter-protesters shared the blame for violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe collapse of the councils was an extraordinary rebuke to a president who prides himself on being business-friendly. High-profile CEOs like JPMorgan Chase' Jamie Dimon have publicly slammed Trump's reaction to Charlottesville.\n\nNow, Trump's words appear to be hurting his own business.\n\n\"The American Red Cross has decided we cannot host our annual fundraising event at Mar-a-Lago, as it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe Red Cross said it \"provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach Daily News social events calendar, The Red Cross was slated to host its International Red Cross Ball at the resort on Feb. 3, 2018.\n\nThe Salvation Army also pulled its Holiday Snow Ball off the venue's events list.\n\n\"Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Kurt Watkins said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society and an organization that supports disaster relief said they were abandoning plans for fundraisers at the private club.\n\n\"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. It did not give a reason for its cancellation -- the first time in eight years it will not hold the event at Mar-a-Lago. The announcement was reported earlier Thursday by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the hospital group's CEO, was among the executives on one of Trump's business councils.\n\nA few hours after the Cleveland Clinic's announcement, the American Cancer Society pulled out.\n\nThe nonprofit said in a statement that it had planned to host its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\" But the organization said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values.\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which has hosted its annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade -- has not selected another venue. The decision was reported earlier by the Palm Beach Post.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nTrump retained an ownership interest in his business when he took office, which means he has a personal stake in Mar-a-Lago's success. As president, he has raised the club's profile by making repeated visits there.\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year. It coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement.\n\nThe event was scheduled to take place at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 25, 2018.\n\nTwo organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months confirmed they'll go ahead with their plans.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said it would still host its annual black-tie dinner dance at the club on January 6, 2018, citing its deposit and the size of the venue.\n\nThe Kravis Center for the Performing Arts confirmed it will host a wine auction at the club on Feb. 1.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T18:43:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1494, "textStart": 1482, "date": "2018-02-03", "amb": false},

It has been held at Mar-a-Lago the last eight years.\n\nBut, citing Trump's positions, more than 1,100 doctors, nurses, medical students and other Ohio residents signed a public letter of concern over the choice of venue.\n\nThe letter said the hospital's support for the Trump Organization was unacceptable \"because it symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare and cut billions of dollars in research funding from the National Institutes of Health budget.\"\n\nOne doctor who signed said Trump's approach to medicine defies the hospital's core principles for diversity, integrity, research and facts.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced similar pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nSubscribe", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:10:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "16:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "194057", "label": {"eng": "Columbus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "219910", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 4}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 1}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 4}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303807", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Health care"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "score": 2}, {"id": "306054", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act", "score": 3}, {"id": "308217", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "score": 2}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 3}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/timesdaily.com/content/tncms/custom/image/d8cc6cd8-2760-11e6-89ad-c3c5c744d99d.jpg?_dc=1464720759", "timeCrawl": "16:10:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Cleveland Clinic will pull event from Mar-a-Lago resort", "originalArticle": null}

Now, major organizations are canceling plans to hold events at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society and an organization that supports disaster relief said Thursday they were abandoning plans for fundraisers at the private club.\n\nThe cancellations follow the spectacular implosion of Trump's business councils this week over the president's that counter-protesters shared the blame for violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe collapse of the councils was an extraordinary rebuke to a president who prides himself on being business-friendly. High-profile CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon have publicly slammed Trump's reaction to Charlottesville.\n\nNow, Trump's words appear to be hurting his own business.\n\n\"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. It did not give a reason for its cancellation -- the first time in eight years it will not hold the event at Mar-a-Lago. The announcement was reported earlier Thursday by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the hospital group's CEO, was among the executives on one of Trump's business councils.\n\nA few hours after the Cleveland Clinic's announcement, the American Cancer Society pulled out.\n\nThe nonprofit said in a statement that it had planned to host its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\" But the organization said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values.\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which has hosted the annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade -- has not selected another venue. The decision was reported earlier by the Palm Beach Post.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nTrump retained an ownership interest in his business when he took office, which means he has a personal stake in Mar-a-Lago's success. As president, he has raised the club's profile by making repeated visits there.\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year. It coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement.\n\nThe event was scheduled to take place at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 25, 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, CNNMoney reached out to all the organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months.\n\nOnly one other organization, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, responded to CNNMoney's inquiries. That group confirmed it will host a wine auction at the club on Feb. 1.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T12:38:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2916, "textStart": 2903, "date": "2018-02-25", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3229, "textStart": 3223, "date": "-02-01", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "12:38:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "219173", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 3}, {"id": "302738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "score": 3}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "305843", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shinz\u014d Abe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinz\u014d_Abe", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 5}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "329675", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "score": 2}, {"id": "347920", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "score": 3}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://sharing.newschannel5.com/sharewptv/photo/2016/11/15/wptv-mar-a-lago_1479217111161_49791709_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "timeCrawl": "12:38:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "3 nonprofits cancel fundraisers at Trump's Mar-A-Lago", "originalArticle": null}

Komen, The Washington Post reported Friday.\n\nPreviously:\n\nTwo major nonprofit organizations are pulling the plug on their plans to host upcoming events at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club amid backlash over his controversial response to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, a nonprofit medical center, announced its decision to cancel hosting its annual charity gala at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018,\" the statement said. \"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.\"\n\nThe annual event, which typically raises around $1 million and is attended by roughly 500 people, had been scheduled to take place on Feb. 24, 2018, and would have marked eight years in a row at the location.\n\nProceeds from the fundraiser benefit Cleveland Clinic Florida, a hospital in Weston, according to Eileen Sheil, executive director of communications at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSheil told HuffPost there were \"a variety of reasons\" the clinic decided to drop Mar-a-Lago, but wouldn't elaborate much further.\n\n\"I think the community really was asking us to not have it there,\" Sheil said, adding that the decision was made Thursday morning.\n\nThe clinic is currently looking into other locations to host the gala.\n\nHours after Cleveland Clinic announced their plans to scrap their planned event, the American Cancer Society followed suit.\n\nThe nationwide health organization confirmed it is seeking a new venue to host its Island of Palm Beach gala on Feb. 22, 2018, in a statement to HuffPost. The organization has hosted the event at Mar-a-Lago since 2007.\n\n\"When we chose to hold our 2018 event and related dinner at Mar-a-Lago, we selected the venue based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" the statement continued. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society and Cleveland Clinic are just the latest organizations to distance themselves from Trump following nearly a week of withering criticism over his response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left one dead and dozens injured.\n\nTrump initially blamed \"many sides\" for hatred and bigotry on Saturday, but eventually specifically condemned white supremacist groups after facing harsh criticism. But the president walked back some of his strong language on Tuesday by defending those who participated in the white nationalist rally and accusing counterprotesters -- whom he referred to as the \"alt-left\" -- of also acting violently.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the chief executive of Cleveland Clinic was a member of the Strategic and Policy Forum, one of Trump's two business advisory councils that disbanded this week in the wake of Trump's explosive comments.\n\nOn Monday, Kenneth Fraizer, CEO of Merck & Co., stepped down from Trump's American Manufacturing Council. One by one, top business executives including, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, followed in Fraizer's footsteps. As members of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum began to resign from the group on Wednesday, Trump announced that he was \"ending both\" councils to alleviate \"pressure\" on its members.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, told the Palm Beach Post that organizations should stop holding charity events at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"If you have a conscience, you're really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there,\" Baker said. \"Many say it's the dollars (raised at the events) that count. Yes. But the integrity of any organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship.\"\n\nTrump Organization representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost's multiple requests for comment. A receptionist for Mar-a-Lago said she was told to direct phone calls to the White House. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment on the canceled events.\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T21:46:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 15, "textStart": 8, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 994, "textStart": 981, "date": "2018-02-24", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1813, "textStart": 1800, "date": "2018-02-22", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "21:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 3}, {"id": "302718", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 3}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 4}, {"id": "304270", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "score": 4}, {"id": "305381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "305969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "score": 3}, {"id": "311015", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Under Armour"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Armour", "score": 2}, {"id": "312006", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Intel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "321096", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "score": 2}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "392074", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brian Krzanich"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Krzanich", "score": 2}, {"id": "394340", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "score": 2}, {"id": "455624", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Plank"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Plank", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vZGKgMCvpd8RHnADtpz0Gw--/aD0xNjgxO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/the_huffington_post_584/ddd0cefc22dbb5cae31bdd5df44a10e8", "timeCrawl": "21:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Major Nonprofits Cancel Events At Trump's Mar-A-Lago", "originalArticle": null}

It didn't elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump's plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.\n\nA few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nFalco declined to elaborate.\n\nLate Thursday, the American Friends of Magen David Adom announced it had decided not to hold its 2018 fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. The group, which raises money for an ambulance service in Israel, has been holding its annual gala at the resort since 2012.\n\nIts spokesman, Erik Levis, gave no reason but said the decision came after \"considerable deliberation.\" His statement noted the organization is \"apolitical.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The managing director of Trump's properties in Florida, Bernd Lembcke, did not respond to a phone call seeking comment, either.\n\nThe president has drawn widespread and bipartisan criticism for his comments at a Trump Tower news conference where he insisted that \"both sides\" were to blame for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville where a counterprotester was killed. The president dissolved two business councils after members who are CEOs began quitting.\n\nCleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove was a member of one of those panels designed to advise the president on the economy and jobs.\n\nThe gilded and glittering Mar-a-Lago has been a favorite spot for holding charity events and a money maker for the Trump Organization. Dubbed the Winter White House, it is one of the few places in the area that can hold a large crowd. Its 20,000 square-foot ballroom has massive archways and columns decorated in gold leaf.\n\nPalm Beach town records showed that 21 charities held events at Mar-a-Lago between last November and April, during the active social season.\n\nBut the resort has also become the site of protest by groups who oppose the president's policies and statements.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by the Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children. The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T22:45:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "22:45:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "219173", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "219910", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 5}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 4}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 5}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304759", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 4}, {"id": "314081", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 5}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "394340", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "score": 4}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 4}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/10/mar-a-lago.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:07:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Charities Cancel Mar-a-Lago Events Amid Trump Backlash", "originalArticle": null}

It didn't elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump's plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.\n\nA few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nFalco declined to elaborate.\n\nLate Thursday, the American Friends of Magen David Adom announced it had decided not to hold its 2018 fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago.

The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T12:10:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "12:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "219910", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 5}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304759", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "394340", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "score": 4}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "timeCrawl": "12:10:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "3 Charities Cancel Mar-a-Lago Events ", "originalArticle": null}

Now, major organizations are canceling plans to hold events at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society and an organization that supports disaster relief said Thursday they were abandoning plans for fundraisers at the private club.\n\nThe cancellations follow the spectacular implosion of Trump's business councils this week over the president's that counter-protesters shared the blame for violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe collapse of the councils was an extraordinary rebuke to a president who prides himself on being business-friendly. High-profile CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon have publicly slammed Trump's reaction to Charlottesville.\n\nNow, Trump's words appear to be hurting his own business.\n\n\"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. It did not give a reason for its cancellation -- the first time in eight years it will not hold the event at Mar-a-Lago. The announcement was reported earlier Thursday by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the hospital group's CEO, was among the executives on one of Trump's business councils.\n\nA few hours after the Cleveland Clinic's announcement, the American Cancer Society pulled out.\n\nThe nonprofit said in a statement that it had planned to host its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\" But the organization said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values.\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which has hosted the annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade -- has not selected another venue. The decision was reported earlier by the Palm Beach Post.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nTrump retained an ownership interest in his business when he took office, which means he has a personal stake in Mar-a-Lago's success. As president, he has raised the club's profile by making repeated visits there.\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year. It coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement.\n\nThe event was scheduled to take place at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 25, 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, CNNMoney reached out to all the organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months.\n\nOnly one other organization, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, responded to CNNMoney's inquiries.

Komen -- announced they are canceling plans for fundraising events at President Trump's Palm Beach country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe three joined a growing list of nonprofits that have severed ties with the exclusive, Trump-owned resort. Others include the Cleveland Clinic and the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe cancellations come in the wake of Trump's controversial comments made earlier this week when he said that \"both sides were to blame\" for last weekend's deadly violence involving white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nTrump has been under heavy criticism all week for his remarks, which prompted many corporate leaders to bail out of White House advisory boards. So many CEOs resigned that the president responded by disbanding three committees -- one focused on shaping business strategy, another on boosting manufacturing and third on improving infrastructure.\n\nAfter the CEOs started refusing to work with the president, pressure increased on charities to give up their annual trips to Mar-a-Lago for galas.\n\nFor example, Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove had served on one of the disbanded business councils. And a day after that dismantling happened, the hospital announced that \"after careful consideration,\" Cleveland Clinic would not hold its 2018 event at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nEarlier this year, despite a petition drive by doctors and medical students, the hospital had refused to cancel its fundraiser there. When medical students and other groups renewed the push recently, Cleveland Clinic remained firm, saying Mar-a-Lago met its needs.\n\nNow, it does not.\n\nThe American Red Cross said in its statement that it must provide \"assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions.\"\n\nThe charity's connection with the president's club \"has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" it said.\n\nThe Salvation Army issued a similar statement, saying its event at Mar-a-Lago helped raise money for disaster victims and the homeless. \"Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event,\" the group says, \"we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nSusan G. Komen, a charity that invests in breast cancer research, confirmed it is also withdrawing from Mar-a-Lago and is seeking a new venue for its fundraising event.\n\nThe rash of high-profile cancellations has created something of a scramble in Palm Beach as charities look for other suitable venues. The Palm Beach Post says other nearby hotels and the Palm Beach County Convention Center are hearing from interested groups.\n\nFor Trump, the cancellations will mean a significant loss of income, unless the staff at Mar-a-Lago finds new customers who want to book a 20,000-square-foot ballroom embellished with 24-karat gold leafing, modeled, as Trump told Florida Design magazine, after Versailles.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:47:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "23:47:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "304628", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "score": 1}, {"id": "306144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "score": 2}, {"id": "306226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "score": 2}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 4}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "344070", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Palm Beach Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Beach_Post", "score": 1}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201708/544546365.jpg", "timeCrawl": "23:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Charities Pull Fundraisers Planned for Trump's Mar-A-Lago ", "originalArticle": null}

Now, charities have begun to ditch Trump's business by canceling fundraisers planned at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn the wake of Trump's failure to fully denounce white nationalists following the violence in Charlottesville, six charities have cancelled events planned for Mar-a-Lago next year.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, a hospital network, pulled its 2018 fundraising gala from Trump's Palm Beach club early Thursday afternoon. The clinic did not share its reasoning behind canceling plans to hold the event at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThen the American Cancer Society announced Thursday afternoon that it would no longer hold its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in February. The charity did not mention Trump by name, but noted its commitment to diversity.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" American Cancer Society spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nLater Thursday, American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports medical first responders in Israel, announced that it would no longer hold its annual fundraiser at Mar-A-Lago in 2018. The group, which held its fundraiser at Trump's club last year, did not offer specific reasoning for pulling the event from the Trump family venue.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nFour charities announced plans to move their venues from Mar-A-Lago on Friday, including several major national foundations.\n\nThe American Red Cross, which was scheduled to hold an event in February of next year, announced that it pulled the event from Mar-A-Lago \"as it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters.\"\n\n\"We believe this action will allow us to continue to put the focus on our lifesaving mission and the people we serve. The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which was set to hold a fundraiser at Trump's Palm Beach club in December, said Friday that the venue had become a distraction.\n\n\"The Salvation Army relies heavily on fundraising events like The Holiday Snow Ball in Palm Beach to further our mission of helping those in need through a range of social services including food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, clothing and shelter for the homeless, and opportunities for the underprivileged,\" the group said in a statement. \"Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe Susan G.

It did not give a reason. The announcement was reported earlier Thursday by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nA few hours after the Cleveland Clinic's announcement, the American Cancer Society followed suit.\n\nThe nonprofit said in a statement that it had planned to host its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\" But the organization said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values.\n\nThe nonprofit -- which has hosted the annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade -- has not yet selected another venue.

The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year.\n\nThat event coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump attended any portion of the American Cancer Society's event, but he is known to pop in on fundraisers. In fact, Trump served as a co-chair for the American Cancer Society's annual event in 2014, the organization said.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic is a hospital group based in Cleveland, but it has a health center in South Florida. Proceeds from previous Mar-a-Lago galas have helped pay for medical equipment, nursing education and wheelchairs, according to the organization's website.\n\nA spokeswoman said the event raises about $1 million each year on average. She said the Cleveland Clinic has not yet decided on a date or new location for the 2018 gala. The 2017 gala was in February.\n\nThe clinic had received criticism for hosting the annual event at Mar-a-Lago. Earlier this year, protesters organized outside the Cleveland center to pressure the hospital to cancel the event, according to local media reports.\n\nAnd in July, nearly 1,700 people -- including doctors and medical students -- signed an open letter asking the clinic to hold the fundraiser somewhere else.\n\nHolding the fundraiser there \"symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare and cut billions of dollars in research funding from the National Institutes of Health budget,\" read the letter, which was posted on Medium.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "22:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "219173", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "242096", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 3}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "303777", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Resort"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort", "score": 3}, {"id": "303806", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Physician"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "score": 1}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 4}, {"id": "304906", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "score": 2}, {"id": "305381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "score": 4}, {"id": "305843", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shinz\u014d Abe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinz\u014d_Abe", "score": 2}, {"id": "314081", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 5}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "329659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "score": 3}, {"id": "329675", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "score": 2}, {"id": "344070", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Palm Beach Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Beach_Post", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://sharing.theindychannel.com/sharewptv/photo/2016/11/15/wptv-mar-a-lago_1479217111161_49791709_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:50:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Cleveland Clinic, American Cancer Society pull events from Trump resort", "originalArticle": null}

The managing director of Trump's properties in Florida, Bernd Lembcke, did not respond to a phone call seeking comment, either.\n\nThe president has drawn widespread and bipartisan criticism for his comments at a Trump Tower news conference where he insisted that \"both sides\" were to blame for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville where a counterprotester was killed. The president dissolved two business councils after members who are CEOs began quitting.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic said in a statement that it decided not to hold its annual event at his Palm Beach resort after \"careful consideration\" of a number of issues. It didn't elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump's plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.\n\nCleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove was a member of one of those panels designed to advise the president on the economy and jobs.\n\nA few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nFalco declined to elaborate.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump waves to members of the media after a meeting with admirals and generals from the Pentagon at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016. (AP/Andrew Harnik)\n\nThe gilded and glittering Mar-a-Lago has been a favorite spot for holding charity events and a money maker for the Trump Organization. Dubbed the Winter White House, it is one of the few places in the area that can hold a large crowd. Its 20,000 square-foot ballroom has massive archways and columns decorated in gold leaf.\n\nPalm Beach town records showed that 21 charities held events at Mar-a-Lago between last November and April, during the active social season.\n\nBut the resort has also become the site of protest by groups who oppose the president's policies and statements.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the US refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by The Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThis March 11, 2016, file photo shows the Mar-A-Lago Club, owned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in Palm Beach, Florida. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children. The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.\n\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

So many CEOs resigned that the president responded by disbanding three committees -- one focused on shaping business strategy, another on boosting manufacturing and third on improving infrastructure.\n\nAfter the CEOs started refusing to work with the president, pressure increased on charities to give up their annual trips to Mar-a-Lago for galas.\n\nFor example, Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove had served on one of the disbanded business councils. And a day after that dismantling happened, the hospital announced that \"after careful consideration,\" Cleveland Clinic would not hold its 2018 event at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nEarlier this year, despite a petition drive by doctors and medical students, the hospital had refused to cancel its fundraiser there. When medical students and other groups renewed the push recently, Cleveland Clinic remained firm, saying Mar-a-Lago is located in the heart of one of the nation's most affluent communities and met its needs.\n\nNow, it does not.\n\nThe American Red Cross said in its statement that it must provide \"assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions.\"\n\nThe charity's connection with the president's club \"has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" it said.\n\nThe Salvation Army issued a similar statement, saying its event at Mar-a-Lago helped raise money for disaster victims and the homeless. \"Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event,\" the group says, \"we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nSusan G. Komen, a charity that invests in breast cancer research, confirmed it is also withdrawing from Mar-a-Lago and is seeking a new venue for its fundraising event.\n\nThe rash of high-profile cancellations has created something of a scramble in Palm Beach as charities look for other suitable venues. The Palm Beach Post says other nearby hotels and the Palm Beach County Convention Center are hearing from interested groups.\n\nFor Trump, the cancellations will mean a significant loss of income, unless the staff at Mar-a-Lago finds new customers who want to book a 20,000-square-foot ballroom embellished with 24-karat gold leafing, modeled, as Trump told Florida Design magazine, after Versailles.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:22:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "23:22:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "304628", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "score": 1}, {"id": "306144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "score": 2}, {"id": "306226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "score": 2}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 4}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "344070", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Palm Beach Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Beach_Post", "score": 1}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201708/544546365.jpg", "timeCrawl": "23:22:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Charities Pull Fundraisers Planned for Trump's Mar-A-Lago ", "originalArticle": null}

In February, hundreds of doctors, nurses and medical students at the Clinic penned an open letter calling for the hospital to sever its ties with Trump, including its 2017 Mar-a-Lago event.\n\nFollowing the three charities' leads, an additional four charities announced on Friday that they, too, would abandoned planned events at Mar-a-Lago. The American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Susan G. Komen Foundation and Autism Project of Palm Beach County all issued statements announcing that they would be cancelling their planned events or would seek another venue, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\"My hope is that this action will allow us to better focus on our lifesaving mission and the people that we serve,\" a letter to American Red Cross staff about the cancellation from CEO Gail McGovern read, as published by Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell.\n\n\"As you know, the Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need -- regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions -- and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle,\" the letter continued.\n\nIn addition to the seven announced charities, the Unicorn Children's Foundation is \"currently exploring other options\" regarding a planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and will make a decision by early September, Washington Post journalist David Fahrenthold reported on Twitter.\n\n\"The glitter, the shine has gone from the club, and I can't help but think there will be more fallout from it,\" Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce executive director Laurel Baker told the Washington Post, describing Trump's business -- which belongs to the chamber -- as \"morally reprehensible.\"\n\nTrump has faced severe backlash after failing to sufficiently denounce the white supremacist groups at the heart of Saturday's \"Unite the Right\" rally, claiming in a Tuesday press conference that \"both sides\" -- referring to the anti-racist protesters present -- were at fault. In addition to the canceled Mar-a-Lago events, two of Trump's business advisory councils, the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative and Strategic and Policy Forum, were dissolved in the wake of Charlottesville, while the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities became the first White House department to resign en masse.\n\nThursday and Friday's canceled events, however, simply continue an existing downward trend for Mar-a-Lago in the wake of Trump's long-controversial presidency. In June, the Washington Post reported that seven nonprofits had already decided not to return to Mar-a-Lago for events in the 2017-2018 as planned, and 13 separate events that had previously taken place at Mar-a-Lago would be moved elsewhere.\n\nAs of June, only 25 events had been confirmed for the Mar-a-Lago's 2017-18 season, as compared with over 50 just before Trump announced his candidacy in 2014-15, the Post noted. Nonprofits that had made the decision to pull out of Mar-a-Lago prior to Charlottesville include the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, American Humane and the MorseLife Health System.\n\nThough many companies have now moved away from Mar-a-Lago, a few holdouts still remain. According to Fahrenthold and Harwell, charities still scheduled to hold 2018 events at Mar-a-Lago include the Achilles Freedom Team, Life/Leaders in Furthering Education, the Palm Beach Police Foundation, the Palm Beach Zoo and the Palm Beach County GOP.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:15:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "17:15:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302509", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "score": 4}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 5}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "302948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "score": 2}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "303110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "score": 5}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 2}, {"id": "304270", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "score": 5}, {"id": "306130", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "score": 5}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 3}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 5}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "515460", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Unite the Right"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right", "score": 4}, {"id": "852603", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gail J.

She said the Cleveland Clinic has not yet decided on a date or new location for the 2018 gala. The 2017 gala was in February.\n\nThe clinic had received criticism for hosting the annual event at Mar-a-Lago.

The Palm Beach Post says other nearby hotels and the Palm Beach County Convention Center are hearing from interested groups.\n\nFor Trump, the cancellations will mean a significant loss of income, unless the staff at Mar-a-Lago finds new customers who want to book a 20,000 square foot ballroom, embellished with 24-karat gold leafing, modelled, as Trump told \"Florida Design\" magazine, after Versailles.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T22:51:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.800000011920929, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {"liCnt": 16}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "22:51:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 3}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 5}, {"id": "304628", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "score": 1}, {"id": "306144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "score": 2}, {"id": "306226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "score": 2}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "319689", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Susan G.

Another longtime Mar-a-Lago customer, the Cleveland Clinic, abruptly changed course on its winter event only days after saying it planned to continue doing business at Mar-a-Lago, a leading venue for charitable events in the posh resort town.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, which raises money for Israel's equivalent of the Red Cross, also said it would not hold its 2018 gala at the club \"after considerable deliberation,\" though it did not give a reason. The charity had one of Mar-a-Lago's biggest events last season, with about 600 people in attendance.\n\nThe cancellations will undoubtedly squeeze revenue for the private club Trump calls the \"winter White House,\" where similar-size events have often brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000 each.\n\nBut the Florida club may face an even deeper crisis of confidence from the local business community. The head of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, of which Mar-a-Lago is a member, called the business \"morally reprehensible\" on Thursday and said she expected more charities to defect.\n\n\"The glitter, the shine has gone from the club,\" chamber executive director Laurel Baker said, \"and I can't help but think there will be more fallout from it.\"\n\nThe rapid rejections of one of the president's signature businesses revealed a possible financial vulnerability for Trump, who has been fiercely criticized this week for equating the actions of white supremacists and neo-Nazis with those of counterprotesters during a violent weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nThey also come days after Trump faced condemnations from corporate executives on two of the White House's top business advisory groups, which were disbanded in a stinging rebuke to Trump after his controversial message.\n\nThe White House referred questions about the charitable events to the Trump Organization, which did not respond.\n\nAt least seven other groups that frequented Mar-a-Lago - including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in New York and the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami - have announced in recent months that they would choose other venues, citing reasons such as political differences and security hassles.\n\nMar-a-Lago's upcoming winter season, the peak of Palm Beach social life, looks as though it will be the slowest period for charity events in at least a decade, according to a Washington Post analysis of upcoming events.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's leading medical centers, abruptly canceled its event plans Thursday, and spokeswoman Eileen Sheil told the Post that \"there were a variety of factors\" behind the cancellation. \"We're not elaborating,\" she added.\n\nShortly afterward, the American Cancer Society announced that it was backing out, saying in a statement: \"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nBoth health-related groups faced growing pressure to reconsider their support of the president's business amid Trump controversies. But the cancellations don't come without risk: The Cleveland Clinic said it had raised about $1 million a year for medical equipment over the past eight years at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBaker, head of the Palm Beach chamber, spoke vigorously against Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, saying that her directive to nearby charities was, \"If you're looking at your mission statement, can you honestly say having an event at Mar-a-Lago, given all that has transpired, is the best stewardship of your efforts?\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic had still intended to host its ninth gala there as recently as last week. The move followed weeks of public turmoil, including a letter signed by 1,600 health professionals and others last month that said the Mar-a-Lago booking \"symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare.\"\n\nThe clinic's chief executive, Toby Cosgrove, was among the business leaders on the president's Strategic and Policy Forum who agreed to disband Wednesday. Trump said on Twitter that he would end the forum and a separate American Manufacturing Council \"rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople.\"\n\nMar-a-Lago has faced growing scrutiny from supporters of Trump's \"buy American, hire American\" agenda because of its recent requests for foreign workers. The club, which has sought dozens of H-2B visas for foreign employees because it argued that it can't find Americans to do the work, was absent last week at a job fair in West Palm Beach.\n\nThe charity moves are a welcome development for other venues, such as the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa, where spokesman Nick Gold said calls have increased from groups looking to hold fundraising events.\n\n\"There's a lot of concern from these charities, where their boards of directors are probably not wanting to be at Mar-a-Lago for a variety of reasons,\" including reasons related to Trump, he said.\n\nPublished: August 18, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 11:04 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

It didn't elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump's plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.\n\nA few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nFalco declined to elaborate.\n\nLate Thursday, the American Friends of Magen David Adom announced it had decided not to hold its 2018 fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. The group, which raises money for an ambulance service in Israel, has been holding its annual gala at the resort since 2012.\n\nIts spokesman, Erik Levis, gave no reason but said the decision came after \"considerable deliberation.\" His statement noted the organization is \"apolitical.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The managing director of Trump's properties in Florida, Bernd Lembcke, did not respond to a phone call seeking comment, either.\n\nThe president has drawn widespread and bipartisan criticism for his comments at a Trump Tower news conference where he insisted that \"both sides\" were to blame for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville where a counterprotester was killed. The president dissolved two business councils after members who are CEOs began quitting.\n\nCleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove was a member of one of those panels designed to advise the president on the economy and jobs.\n\nThe gilded and glittering Mar-a-Lago has been a favorite spot for holding charity events and a money maker for the Trump Organization. Dubbed the Winter White House, it is one of the few places in the area that can hold a large crowd. Its 20,000 square-foot ballroom has massive archways and columns decorated in gold leaf.\n\nPalm Beach town records showed that 21 charities held events at Mar-a-Lago between last November and April, during the active social season.\n\nBut the resort has also become the site of protest by groups who oppose the president's policies and statements.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by The Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children.

It comes after the clinic was pressured to cut ties following Trump's stance on healthcare policies and his Charlottesville remarks\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic had initially resisted pressure from health professionals and others over the president's support for repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting federal budget dollars to medical research.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic maintained that the event, which has been hosted at Mar-a-Lago the past eight years, was not political.\n\nSpokeswoman Eileen Sheil said last week: 'For us, this is more about raising money to help our clinical programs and patient care. This is not a political statement by the Cleveland Clinic by any means.'\n\nHowever, the clinic went back on its original statement with the decision to pull the event after 'careful consideration' of various issues.\n\nIt seems the hospital is trying to distance itself from Trump's administration, after the clinic's CEO Toby Cosgrove was one of the business leaders on the Trump's Manufacturing Council who did not resign before the council was disbanded on Wednesday.\n\nA growing number of business leaders were resigning from the advisory panels, openly expressing their displeasure with Trump's comments.\n\nTrump had claimed that 'both sides' were to blame for weekend violence that left one woman dead and led to a helicopter crash that killed two state troopers in Charlottesville\n\nTrump announced he was pulling the plug from his two business councils on Wednesday\n\nIt was primarily over his insistence that 'both sides' were to blame for weekend violence that left one woman dead and led to a helicopter crash that killed two state troopers in Charlottesville.\n\nIn a face-saving effort, Trump tweeted from Trump Tower in New York: 'Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!'\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's Mar-a-Lago event has raised $700,000 to $1million annually to expand programs and purchase equipment for the hospital's Florida facility.\n\nThe public letter seeking relocation of the event quickly collected more than 1,100 signatures from doctors, nurses, medical students and other Ohio residents concerned about the nation's No. 2-ranked hospital patronizing a Trump business.\n\nIt seems the hospital is trying to distance itself from Trump's administration, after the clinic's CEO Toby Cosgrove (pictured) was one of the business leaders on the Trump's Manufacturing Council who did not resign before the council was disbanded\n\nA Columbus cardiologist who signed it says Cleveland Clinic is a thought leader in medicine and Trump's support for repealing the Affordable Care Act goes against its core principles supporting science, research and integrity.\n\n'The Cleveland Clinic has always been a bastion of science, of research and of integrity,' said Greg Lam, a member of the Physicians Action Network. 'When the founders established the Cleveland Clinic in 1921, it was based on the principles of diversity, integrity, research and facts. And that's completely antithetical to what Donald Trump represents.'\n\nThe letter said the hospital's support for the Trump Organization is unacceptable 'because it symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare and cut billions of dollars in research funding from the National Institutes of Health budget.'\n\nThe American Red Cross faced similar pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nHowever, the Ohio-based clinic (pictured) doubled back on its original statement with the decision to pull the event after 'careful consideration' of various

High-profile CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon have publicly slammed Trump's reaction to Charlottesville.\n\nNow, Trump's words appear to be hurting his own business.\n\nRelated: Stunning rebuke for the CEO president\n\n\"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. It did not give a reason for its cancellation -- the first time in eight years it will not hold the event at Mar-a-Lago. The announcement was reported earlier Thursday by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the hospital group's CEO, was among the executives on one of Trump's business councils.\n\nA few hours after the Cleveland Clinic's announcement, the American Cancer Society pulled out.\n\nThe nonprofit said in a statement that it had planned to host its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\" But the organization said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values.\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which has hosted the annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade -- has not selected another venue. The decision was reported earlier by the Palm Beach Post.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nTrump retained an ownership interest in his business when he took office, which means he has a personal stake in Mar-a-Lago's success. As president, he has raised the club's profile by making repeated visits there.\n\nRelated: America's top CEOs always had an awkward relationship with Trump\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year. It coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement.\n\nThe event was scheduled to take place at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 25, 2018.\n\nRelated: What happened behind the scenes as Trump's business councils fell apart\n\nOn Thursday, CNNMoney reached out to all the organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months.\n\nOnly one other organization, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, responded to CNNMoney's inquiries.

Komen foundation -- and one local charity all said Friday they were canceling events at the Palm Beach resort.\n\nThat came after three charities and organizations made similar announcements on Thursday.\n\nThe cancellations follow the spectacular implosion of Trump's business councils this week over the president's insistence that counter-protesters shared the blame for violence at a white nationalist rally.\n\nNow, Trump's words seem to have hurt his own business.\n\nWhile a couple of organizations that decided to pull their business from Mar-a-Lago did not cite a reason, most named the current political climate as the reason for the move.\n\n\"The American Red Cross has decided we cannot host our annual fundraising event at Mar-a-Lago, as it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the organization said Friday.\n\nThe Salvation Army also pulled its Holiday Snow Ball off the venue's events list \"because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event,\" spokesperson Kurt Watkins said.\n\nThe Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation joined the roster of cancellations Friday afternoon, saying the group \"stands with the Palm Beach community and has canceled its 5th Annual Bipolar Medical Luncheon at The Mar-a-Lago Club.\"\n\nThe Palm Beach-based foundation said it would host the luncheon at a different location at a later date.\n\nYet another philanthropic event could also be on its way out. The president of Leaders in Furthering Education on Friday urged the board of her charity to abandon Mar-a-Lago for the organization's annual Lady in Red Gala, slated for December 2.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists are repugnant and repulsive -- and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for,\" LIFE President Lois Pope said in a statement. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nIt's not clear when or if the board will approve the move.\n\nCleveland Clinic did not provide a specific reason for its decision to pull its annual fundraiser off Mar-a-Lago's events calendar, but Toby Cosgrove, the hospital group's CEO, was among the first executives to quit Trump's business councils in protest to his remarks about Virginia.\n\nIt'll be the first time in eight years the hospital group will not hold its annual fundraiser at the club.\n\nAlso on Thursday, The American Cancer society said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values. The group has hosted fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago every year for the past decade.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed Thursday that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement. The organization declined to give a reason.\n\nTwo organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months confirmed they'll go ahead with their plans.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said it would still host its annual black-tie dinner dance at the club on January 6, 2018, citing its deposit and the size of the venue.\n\nThe Kravis Center for the Performing Arts confirmed it will host a wine auction at the club on Feb. 1.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment for this story.

High-profile CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon have publicly slammed Trump's reaction to the violence that broke out at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday.\n\nNow, Trump's words appear to be hurting his own business.\n\n\"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement.

The decision was reported earlier by the Palm Beach Post.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year.\n\nThat event coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump attended any portion of the American Cancer Society's event, but he is known to pop in on fundraisers. In fact, Trump served as a co-chair for the American Cancer Society's annual event in 2014, the organization said.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement.\n\nThe event was scheduled to

It didn't elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump's plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.\n\nA few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nFalco declined to elaborate.\n\nLate Thursday, the American Friends of Magen David Adom announced it had decided not to hold its 2018 fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. The group, which raises money for an ambulance service in Israel, has been holding its annual gala at the resort since 2012.\n\nIts spokesman, Erik Levis, gave no reason but said the decision came after \"considerable deliberation.\" His statement noted the organization is \"apolitical.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The managing director of Trump's properties in Florida, Bernd Lembcke, did not respond to a phone call seeking comment, either.\n\nThe president has drawn widespread and bipartisan criticism for his comments at a Trump Tower news conference where he insisted that \"both sides\" were to blame for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville where a counterprotester was killed. The president dissolved two business councils after members who are CEOs began quitting.\n\nCleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove was a member of one of those panels designed to advise the president on the economy and jobs.\n\nThe gilded and glittering Mar-a-Lago has been a favorite spot for holding charity events and a money maker for the Trump Organization. Dubbed the Winter White House, it is one of the few places in the area that can hold a large crowd. Its 20,000 square-foot ballroom has massive archways and columns decorated in gold leaf.\n\nPalm Beach town records showed that 21 charities held events at Mar-a-Lago between last November and April, during the active social season.\n\nBut the resort has also become the site of protest by groups who oppose the president's policies and statements.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by The Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children. The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T00:24:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "00:24:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "219910", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 5}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304759", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "394340", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "score": 4}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.centredaily.com/static/images/centredaily/facebook.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "3 charities cancel Mar-a-Lago events amid Trump backlash", "originalArticle": null}

The exits continued into the weekend, making eight cancellations.\n\nOn Saturday, the Palm Beach Preservation Foundation became the latest Trump customer to put its foot down.\n\n\"Given the current environment surrounding Mar-a-Lago, we have made the decision to move our annual dinner dance,\" the foundation said via Twitter.\n\nThe exodus comes amid backlash to Trump's widely criticized remarks in the wake of a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.\n\nThree major national organizations -- The American Red Cross, The Salvation Army and Susan G. Komen foundation -- and one local charity all said Friday they were canceling events at the Palm Beach resort.\n\nThat came after three charities and organizations made similar announcements on Thursday.\n\nThe cancellations follow the spectacular implosion of Trump's business councils this week over the president's insistence that counter-protesters shared the blame for violence at a white nationalist rally.\n\nNow, Trump's words seem to have hurt his own business.\n\nWhile a couple of organizations that decided to pull their business from Mar-a-Lago did not cite a reason, most named the current political climate as the reason for the move.\n\n\"The American Red Cross has decided we cannot host our annual fundraising event at Mar-a-Lago, as it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the organization said Friday.\n\nThe Salvation Army also pulled its Holiday Snow Ball off the venue's events list \"because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event,\" spokesperson Kurt Watkins said.\n\nThe Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation joined the roster of cancellations Friday afternoon, saying the group \"stands with the Palm Beach community and has canceled its 5th Annual Bipolar Medical Luncheon at The Mar-a-Lago Club.\"\n\nThe Palm Beach-based foundation said it would host the luncheon at a different location at a later date.\n\nYet another philanthropic event could also be on its way out. The president of Leaders in Furthering Education on Friday urged the board of her charity to abandon Mar-a-Lago for the organization's annual Lady in Red Gala, slated for December 2.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists are repugnant and repulsive -- and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for,\" LIFE President Lois Pope said in a statement. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nIt's not clear when or if the board will approve the move.\n\nCleveland Clinic did not provide a specific reason for its decision to pull its annual fundraiser off Mar-a-Lago's events calendar, but Toby Cosgrove, the hospital group's CEO, was among the first executives to quit Trump's business councils in protest to his remarks about Virginia.\n\nIt'll be the first time in eight years the hospital group will not hold its annual fundraiser at the club.\n\nAlso on Thursday, The American Cancer society said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values. The group has hosted fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago every year for the past decade.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services and disaster-relief organization, confirmed Thursday that it, too, has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement. The organization declined to give a reason.\n\nTwo organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months confirmed they'll go ahead with their plans.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said it would still host its annual black-tie dinner dance at the club on January 6, 2018, citing its deposit and the size of the venue.\n\nThe Kravis Center for the Performing Arts confirmed it will host a wine auction at the club on Feb. 1.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment for this story.

Another longtime Mar-a-Lago customer, the Cleveland Clinic, abruptly changed course on its winter event only days after saying it planned to continue doing business at Mar-a-Lago, a leading venue for charitable events in the posh resort town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, which raises money for Israel's equivalent of the Red Cross, also said it would not hold its 2018 gala at the club ''after considerable deliberation,'' though it did not give a reason. The charity had one of Mar-a-Lago's biggest events last season, with about 600 people in attendance.\n\nThe cancellations will undoubtedly squeeze revenue for the private club Trump calls the ''winter White House,'' where similar-size events have often brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000 each.\n\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

The head of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, of which Mar-a-Lago is a member, called the business ''morally reprehensible'' on Thursday and said she expected more charities to defect.\n\n''The glitter, the shine has gone from the club,'' chamber executive director Laurel Baker said, ''and I can't help but think there will be more fallout from it.''\n\nThe rapid rejections of one of the president's signature businesses revealed a possible financial vulnerability for Trump, who has been fiercely criticized this week for equating the actions of white supremacists and neo-Nazis with protesters during a violent weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also come days after Trump faced condemnations from corporate executives on two of the White House's top business advisory groups, which disbanded in a stinging affront of Trump's controversial message.\n\nThe White House referred questions about the charitable events to the Trump Organization, which did not respond.\n\nAt least seven other groups that frequented Mar-a-Lago - including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in New York and the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami - have announced in recent months that they would choose other venues, citing reasons such as political differences and security hassles.\n\nMar-a-Lago's upcoming winter season, the peak of Palm Beach social life, looks as though it will be the slowest period for charity events in at least a decade, according to a Washington Post analysis of upcoming events.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's leading medical centers, abruptly canceled its event plans Thursday, and spokeswoman Eileen Sheil told The Post that ''there were a variety of factors'' behind the cancellation. ''We're not elaborating,'' she added.\n\nShortly afterward, the American Cancer Society announced that it was backing out, saying in a statement: ''Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.''\n\nBoth health-related groups faced growing pressure to reconsider their support of the president's business amid Trump controversies. But the cancellations don't come without risk: The Cleveland Clinic said it had raised about $1 million a year for medical equipment over the past eight years at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBaker, head of the Palm Beach chamber, spoke vigorously against Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, saying that her directive to nearby charities was ''If you're looking at your mission statement, can you honestly say having an event at Mar-a-Lago, given all that has transpired, is the best stewardship of your efforts?''\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic had still intended to host its ninth gala there as recently as last week. The move followed weeks of public turmoil, including a letter signed by 1,600 health professionals and others last month that said the Mar-a-Lago booking ''symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare.''\n\nThe clinic's chief executive, Toby Cosgrove, was among the business leaders on the president's Strategic and Policy Forum who agreed to disband Wednesday. Trump said on Twitter that he would end the forum and a separate American Manufacturing Council ''rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople.''\n\nMar-a-Lago has faced growing scrutiny from supporters of Trump's ''buy American, hire American'' agenda because of its recent requests for foreign workers. The club, which has sought dozens of H-2B visas for foreign employees because it argued that it can't find Americans to do the work, was absent last week at a job fair in West Palm Beach.\n\nThe charity moves are a welcome development for other venues, such as the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa, where spokesman Nick Gold said calls have increased from groups looking to hold fundraising events.\n\n''There's a lot of concern from these charities, where their boards of directors are probably not wanting to be at Mar-a-Lago for a variety of reasons,'' including reasons related to Trump, he said.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T01:42:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.772549033164978, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "01:42:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 1}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 5}, {"id": "303110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "score": 5}, {"id": "304270", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 4}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 4}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.bostonglobe.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2017/08/17/BostonGlobe.com/Politics/Images/5264bcb9c2b9413fbe02858aa8ed47c2-80bfb11a49cf4c94bbb8c7ae49796206-0.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:42:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Fundraisers canceled at Mar-a-Lago after Trump's Charlottesville remarks - The Boston Globe", "originalArticle": null}

Its 20,000 square-foot ballroom has massive archways and columns decorated in gold leaf.\n\nPalm Beach town records showed that 21 charities held events at Mar-a-Lago between last November and April, during the active social season.\n\nBut the resort has also become the site of protest by groups who oppose the president's policies and statements.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by The Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children. The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.\n\n___\n\nCondon reported from New York and Smyth from Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The organization has hosted the event at Mar-a-Lago since 2007.\n\n\"When we chose to hold our 2018 event and related dinner at Mar-a-Lago, we selected the venue based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" the statement continued. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society and Cleveland Clinic are just the latest organizations to distance themselves from Trump following nearly a week of withering criticism over his response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left one dead and dozens injured.\n\nTrump initially blamed \"many sides\" for hatred and bigotry on Saturday, but eventually specifically condemned white supremacist groups after facing harsh criticism. But the president walked back some of his strong language on Tuesday by defending those who participated in the white nationalist rally and accusing counterprotesters -- whom he referred to as the \"alt-left\" -- of also acting violently.\n\nToby Cosgrove, the chief executive of Cleveland Clinic was a member of the Strategic and Policy Forum, one of Trump's two business advisory councils that disbanded this week in the wake of Trump's explosive comments.\n\nOn Monday, Kenneth Fraizer, CEO of Merck & Co., stepped down from Trump's American Manufacturing Council. One by one, top business executives including, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, followed in Fraizer's footsteps. As members of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum began to resign from the group on Wednesday, Trump announced that he was \"ending both\" councils to alleviate \"pressure\" on its members.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, told the Palm Beach Post that organizations should stop holding charity events at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"If you have a conscience, you're really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there,\" Baker said. \"Many say it's the dollars (raised at the events) that count. Yes. But the integrity of any organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship.\"\n\nTrump Organization representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost's multiple requests for comment. A receptionist for Mar-a-Lago said she was told to direct phone calls to the White House.

According to the Palm Beach Daily News, the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute had already moved their upcoming fundraisers to other Palm Beach venues after facing controversy for using Mar-a-Lago in the past.\n\nBut for months, the Cleveland Clinic said it was sticking with Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThat changed Thursday, after continued criticism of Trump's response to white supremacist and neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. and the violence that followed.\n\nIt's well known that CEO Toby Cosgrove has enjoyed a good relationship with the president. In the early days of his administration, Trump asked Cosgrove to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Cosgrove turned him down, though he did take a position on the president's business advisory board. And as several CEOs stepped down from the board in reaction to past Trump controversies -- including the travel ban and the Paris Accord -- Cosgrove opted to stay.\n\nThen this week, criticism of Trump's comments about finding \"many sides\" to blame for the violence in Charlottesville brought more departures, prompting Trump to tweet that he was disbanding the group.\n\nWhy did Cosgrove hang on so long?\n\n\"Dr. Cosgrove believes that it's important to be able to provide input at the highest level of government on health care matters,\" spokeswoman Eileen Sheil last week told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland.\n\nBut how has his \"input\" worked out?\n\nTrump continues to push for undoing the Affordable Care Act, even without a replacement. If Trump succeeds, 18 million people could lose health care coverage in the first year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nTrump wants to cut the budget for the National Institutes of Health by almost $6 billion -- money that funds the kind of medical research that's made the clinic famous.\n\nAnd Trump's first attempt at a travel ban -- targeting seven predominantly Muslim countries -- temporarily blocked a Cleveland Clinic doctor of Sudanese descent from coming home from a trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast year, Cleveland Clinic staff similarly raised objections to the gala at Mar-a-Lago, but the clinic said the contract was already signed, it was too late.\n\nFor eight years, the clinic has held its fundraising galas at Mar-a-Lago, raising between $700,000 and $1 million each year. The money helps pay for equipment and expanded programs at its Florida facilities, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe fundraiser, scheduled for Feb. 25, focuses on cardiology equipment and services \"to bring world-class cardiology care to our community,\" its website says. Now it's looking for a new location.\n\n\"After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018,\" the hospital system said in a statement released Thursday, the Plain Dealer reported. \"We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.\"\n\nAll along, the Cleveland Clinic argued its party location was about fundraising success, not making a political statement.\n\nBut Mar-a-Lago is a political venue because of its ties to Trump.\n\nBy either choosing to do business there or choosing to go somewhere else, the Cleveland Clinic couldn't avoid making a political statement.\n\nLeaving Mar-a-Lago could end up costing the clinic donations from Trump supporters, just as sticking with Mar-a-Lago could have scared away other potential donors.You've got to believe hospital leaders took that equation into account.\n\nBut keeping its party at Mar-a-Lago could have left this renowned medical institution paying a bigger long-term price with lost employees, patients and community support.\n\nCosgrove is retiring after 13 years of leading Cleveland Clinic. His work includes expanding the hospital's reach in other countries, reducing the number of employees to cut costs and ushering in an economic rebound last year - which was the hospital's best financial year ever, according to the Plain Dealer.

Shortly after the group decided to dissolve, Trump said on Twitter that he would end the council \"rather than putting pressure on the busi\u00adness\u00adpeo\u00adple.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic is only the latest medical group to swear off an event at the president's club. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in New York and Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami have all announced in recent months that they would choose other venues.\n\nIt's unclear how much the Cleveland Clinic's move could cost Mar-a-Lago. Similar-sized events brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000.\n\nThe 2017-2018 season looks like it will be the slowest period for Mar-a-Lago events in at least a decade, a Washington Post analysis found.\n\n[At Mar-a-Lago, the star power of the presidency helps charities -- and Trump -- make more money]\n\nThe hospital system has faced growing pressure for months to end its relationship with the president's private club.

(AP) -- President Donald Trump's comments about the white nationalist rally last weekend are hurting not just his political standing, but his pocketbook.\n\nThree charities announced Thursday that they were canceling fundraisers at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, a sign the president's business is starting to suffer backlash from his comments Tuesday about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic said in a statement that it decided not to hold its annual event at his Palm Beach resort after \"careful consideration\" of a number of issues. It didn't elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\nDoctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump's plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.\n\nA few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nFalco declined to elaborate.\n\nLate Thursday, the American Friends of Magen David Adom announced it had decided not to hold its 2018 fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. The group, which raises money for an ambulance service in Israel, has been holding its annual gala at the resort since 2012.\n\nIts spokesman, Erik Levis, gave no reason but said the decision came after \"considerable deliberation.\" His statement noted the organization is \"apolitical.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The managing director of Trump's properties in Florida, Bernd Lembcke, did not respond to a phone call seeking comment, either.\n\nThe president has drawn widespread and bipartisan criticism for his comments at a Trump Tower news conference where he insisted that \"both sides\" were to blame for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville where a counterprotester was killed. The president dissolved two business councils after members who are CEOs began quitting.\n\nCleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove was a member of one of those panels designed to advise the president on the economy and jobs.\n\nThe gilded and glittering Mar-a-Lago has been a favorite spot for holding charity events and a money maker for the Trump Organization. Dubbed the Winter White House, it is one of the few places in the area that can hold a large crowd. Its 20,000 square-foot ballroom has massive archways and columns decorated in gold leaf.\n\nPalm Beach town records showed that 21 charities held events at Mar-a-Lago between last November and April, during the active social season.\n\nBut the resort has also become the site of protest by groups who oppose the president's policies and statements.\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by The Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children. The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.\n\n---\n\nCondon reported from New York and Smyth from Columbus, Ohio.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T00:01:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "00:01:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "219910", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 5}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "304759", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "394340", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "score": 4}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "00:07:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "The Colorado Springs Gazette", "originalArticle": null}

The Salvation Army relies \"heavily on fundraising events\" like the ball as part of helping those in need, the group said in a statement.\n\n\"Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe American Red Cross also nixed plans to host an annual fundraising event at the resort calling it a \"source of controversy and pain\" for volunteers, employees and staff.\n\n\"We believe this action will allow us to continue to put the focus on our lifesaving mission and the people we serve,\" according to a statement. \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nDonald Trump has owned Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach estate built by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, since the 1980s. Trump turned it into a private club and is using it as his Weekend White House.\n\nOn Thursday, three large funding organizations -- the American Cancer Society, Cleveland Clinic and American Friends of Magen David Adom -- pulled their events.\n\nThe American Cancer Society's event, held at Trump's Palm Beach estate for 11 years, nets about $450,000 for the organization, according to the American Cancer Society's local office.\n\nThe organization has started looking for another site for the fundraiser. It was held at Mar-a-Lago because of costs, venue requirements and other factors, according to the statement.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic didn't give a reason for its decision. Before changing course, Cleveland Clinic spokeswoman Eileen Sheil had said last week that the hospital system's event was not political. Donors and executives had discussed it and agreed Mar-a-Lago met the organization's needs, she said.\n\nThe fundraiser has raised $700,000 to $1 million annually to expand programs and purchase equipment for the hospital system's Florida facility. It has been held at Mar-a-Lago the past eight years.\n\nTwo other organizations said Friday that their events would proceed as scheduled.\n\nA spokesman for The Kravis Center for the Performing Arts said that as of Thursday afternoon, officials had not changed their minds. \"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the people who are regulars at the event want to keep it there,\" said Gary Schweikhart, spokesman for the Kravis Center.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said it, too, will stay the course. \"The ball typically attracts 700 people, and it's the only venue in Palm Beach that will accommodate a crowd of that size,\" according to a statement issued from the foundation, which supports Palm Beach Police Department employees.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T19:39:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "19:39:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181663", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "242096", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 2}, {"id": "302509", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "score": 5}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 5}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 4}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 3}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 3}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 5}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 4}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 3}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 2}, {"id": "623241", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Merriweather Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Merriweather_Post", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/national_politics/photo/23258774-standard.jpg", "timeCrawl": "20:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Red Cross, Salvation Army, other groups end fundraisers at Trump's Mar-a-Lago", "originalArticle": null}

The organization had held their annual events at Mar-a-Lago for a number of years.\n\nThe decisions to pull out of Mar-a-Lago come after a week of turbulent comments from the president regarding the white-supremacist protests that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations,\" the American Cancer Society said in a statement.\n\nThe organizations join a growing group of organizations and business leaders who have distanced themselves from the president after the events in Charlottesville.

This, as hundreds gathered to mourn at the University of Virginia Wednesday night.\n\n(Published Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017)\n\nThe American Red Cross faced pushback in January, when demonstrators rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the worldwide humanitarian relief organization was offering aid to those affected by Trump's moratorium on the U.S. refugee program.\n\nThe organization did not immediately respond to questions about whether it plans to hold its fundraiser next year at the resort.\n\nSome charities contacted by The Associated Press said they had no plans to change venues.\n\nConfederate Monuments Removed or Vandalized Across US\n\nThe Kravis Center said it plans to keep its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nTrump Says 'Fixing the Inner Cities' Is a Priority\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that \"fixing the inner cities\" is a priority for his administration.\n\n(Published Wednesday, Aug. 16, 2017)\n\nThe event raised $700,000 this year, according to town records, with the proceeds used to buy equipment for the Palm Beach Police Department, help its officers and families when they are in need, and provide scholarships for officers' children. The foundation declined further comment.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said in an email that \"each organization should examine their mission statements to ensure that any fundraising efforts are not compromising their efforts.\"\n\nShe said she is not implying that charities should shun Trump.\n\nVideo'The Moment I Hoped Would Never Come': Oakland Nurse

Komen. Among those that are keeping their events at Mar-a-Lago are the Palm Beach Police Foundation, Gateway for Cancer Research and the Achilles Freedom Team, an organization that trains wounded veterans to take part in marathons.\n\nFor one group, pulling out their gala wasn't the first time it faced public pressure to stand against Trump this week. The Cleveland Clinic, which refused to cancel its Mar-a-Lago fundraiser earlier this year, also had its CEO, Toby Cosgrove, on one of Trump's disbanded business councils. A day after the council was dissolved, the Cleveland Clinic announced that \"after careful consideration,\" it would not return to Mar-a-Lago in 2018.\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach Post, Trump's loss is others' gain, as several hotels in Palm Beach County have been contacted by the charities to serve as replacement hosts for the galas. Cleveland Clinic, for example, is in talks to host their fundraiser at the Eau Palm Beach Resort. The American Cancer Society is still looking for new sites for its 60th anniversary gala and a dinner for sponsors.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" the American Cancer Society said in a statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:51:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "17:51:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302718", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "score": 2}, {"id": "302866", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "score": 3}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "303110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "score": 3}, {"id": "304270", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 3}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 4}, {"id": "344070", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Palm Beach Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Beach_Post", "score": 2}, {"id": "344400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Country club"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_club", "score": 4}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trump-Mar-a-lago.jpg", "timeCrawl": "22:40:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Eight Charities Pull Their Galas Out of Trump's Mar-A-Lago", "originalArticle": null}

It did not give a reason for its cancellation. The announcement was reported earlier Thursday by the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n\nA few hours after the Cleveland Clinic's announcement, the American Cancer Society followed suit.\n\nThe nonprofit said in a statement that it had planned to host its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\" But the organization said \"it has become increasingly clear\" that hosting its fundraiser on Trump-owned property presents a \"challenge\" to its values.\n\nThe American Cancer Society -- which has hosted the annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade -- has not yet selected another venue. The decision was reported earlier by the Palm Beach Post.\n\nMar-a-Lago declined comment. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nThe health organization last hosted its gala in Trump's Palm Beach club in February of this year.\n\nThat event coincided with a visit from Trump, who was in Florida the same weekend to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump attended any portion of the American Cancer Society's event, but he is known to pop in on fundraisers. In fact, Trump served as a co-chair for the American Cancer Society's annual event in 2014, the organization said.\n\nOn Thursday, CNNMoney reached out to all the organizations that have announced plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago in the coming months. The American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that supports Israel's national ambulance, blood-services, and disaster-relief organization, confirmed it too has decided to move its annual gala to another location.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" spokesperson Erik Levis said in a statement.\n\nThe event was scheduled to take place at Mar-a-Lago on February 25, 2018.\n\nOnly one other organization, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, responded to CNNMoney's inquiries.\n\nThat group confirmed it will host a wine auction at the club on February 1.\n\n- An earlier version of this story misidentified the location of the American Friends of Magen David Adom.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T01:15:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2721, "textStart": 2704, "date": "2018-02-25", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2902, "textStart": 2892, "date": "-02-01", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "01:15:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302508", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "score": 3}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "303242", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "score": 2}, {"id": "303777", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Resort"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort", "score": 3}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 4}, {"id": "305381", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "305746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "score": 2}, {"id": "305843", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shinz\u014d Abe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinz\u014d_Abe", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 5}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 5}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "329659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "score": 3}, {"id": "329675", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "score": 2}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://gantdaily.com/images/gant-og-logo.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:15:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Three organizations pull events from Trump resort", "originalArticle": null}

It's not clear where the event is moving.\n\nOn the Preservation Foundation's official Facebook and Twitter accounts, a statement read, \"given the current environment surrounding Mar-a-Lago, we have made the decision to move our annual dinner dance.\"\n\nUPDATED: Here's a list of who's leaving Mar-a-Lago\n\nRELATED: Complains aside, charities plan to stick with Mar-a-Lago\n\nNo one at the Foundation could be reached for comment.\n\nLater Saturday, H.O.W. \"Hearing the Ovarian Cancer Whisper,\" published a statement on their Facebook page that read, \"After careful consideration H.O.W. \"Hearing the Ovarian Cancer Whisper\" has changed its venue for our annual \"Time is of the Essence Luncheon\" from Mar A Lago with a return to our roots at the historically beautiful Flagler Museum.\n\n\"For us, this event is about raising money for research, educational programs, and financial assistance for women undergoing treatment. We are committed to our mission therefore, this is not a political statement made by H.O.W.\"\n\nThe move by the two organizations Saturday brings to 10 the number of nonprofits pulling an event from Mar-a-Lago since the president's controversial news conference Tuesday at Trump Tower on the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., last week.\n\nOn Friday, five additional philanthropic organizations -- Susan G. Komen, the International Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Austin Association of Palm Beach County and Big Dog Ranch -- moved events from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, American Cancer Society and the American Friends of Magen David Adom, an organization supporting Israel disaster relief programs have also changed venues for their events.\n\nThe Raymond F. Kravis Center was scheduled to hold board meetings this weekend to discuss possibly moving The Palm Beach Wine Auction from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"We have received concerns about this event being at Mar-a-Lago,\" Judy Spelling, the center's CEO, said in an email to The Palm Beach Post. \"We have a process to address such issues and we are currently engaged in that process.

The Palm Beach Post reports that on Friday, Susan B. Komen, The Salvation Army, International Red Cross, Autism Association of Palm Beach County, and Big Dog Ranch Rescue all announced they wouldn't hold their planned events at the club this coming winter, joining the Cleveland Clinic, American Cancer Society, and American Friends of Magen David Adom (which supports disaster relief in Israel), who all cancelled their Mar-a-Lago events on Thursday. As with most of the CEOs who quickly backed away from Trump this week, it seems that the president's unhinged Tuesday press conference was what set events in motion.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at that now-infamous event, the combative president doubled down on his previous assertion that white supremacists were not the only people at fault for the violence that erupted at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last Saturday -- violence which resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuries to dozens of others.\n\nThe Palm Beach Daily News adds that a total of 16 charities who held events at Mar-a-Lago over the past year have now bailed on the club in recent months or days. Only five charities, including three local Palm Beach organizations, have committed to still holding their events at Mar-a-Lago. Another four charities with events planned at the club either haven't decided what to do, or haven't yet responded to media inquiries. The executive director of the Palm Peach Chamber of Commerce, Laurel Baker, is urging charitable organizations trying to stick with Mar-a-Lago to reconsider, warning them that deep-pocket donors \"have a conscience.\"\n\nThere have also been calls on social media to boycott charities that were still planning events at the property, which has likely added to the pressure.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations,\" the American Cancer Society explained when announcing that it was moving the two upcoming events it had originally planned to hold at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAt least some of the organizations appeared to have relationships with members of the Trump family. President Trump has repeatedly been the chairman of the International Red Cross' ball, which has been held at Mar-a-Lago since before Trump bought the estate. And Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, was a co-chair of the annual Mar-a-Lago event hosted by Big Dog Ranch Rescue.\n\nOn Saturday, the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, who has tracked the Trump Organization's relationships with charities more than anyone, pointed out that while the Trump hotel in Washington, D.C. has been doing well, his other more distant properties are clearly suffering under the weight of Trump's controversial presidency. That includes not only an event drop-off at Mar-a-Lago -- which now appears to be losing support from the Palm Beach elite who Trump covets -- but also at the Trump SOHO hotel in Manhattan, as well as at the Trump golf courses in the Bronx and Los Angeles. According to Fahrenthold, the trend \"shows how vulnerable Trump's business is to backlash, because it needs big-ticket customers to want to put Trump's name on their own special events.\"\n\nSpeaking of special events, the president and first lady also announced on Saturday that they will not attend this year's Kennedy Center Honors in D.C. in the wake of three of this year's five honorees vowing to boycott the traditional White House reception that accompanies the celebration. The president and first lady traditionally attend the December event, but Donald and Melania Trump are staying away this year \"to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction,\" according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nThis post has been updated to include David Fahrenthold's analysis.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.729411780834198, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "16:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "180884", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "217872", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "228323", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303242", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "score": 3}, {"id": "304270", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "score": 2}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 4}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "328357", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "344070", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Palm Beach Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Beach_Post", "score": 3}, {"id": "356604", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Center Honors"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors", "score": 1}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "735748", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach Daily News"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_Daily_News", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}, {"id": "1406498", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ranch Rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch_Rescue", "score": 4}], "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/19/19-mar-a-lago-tourists.w1200.h630.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Charities Are Pulling Their Events from Trump's Mar-a-Lago", "originalArticle": null}

Komen and the Autism Association of Palm Beach County.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, a group supporting Israel's ambulance and disaster relief programs, also pulled its event from the club, a shindig that last year drew 600 attendees who paid $650 each to get in.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago,\" the group announced.\n\nCharity galas traditionally have been a major stream of revenue for Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the past, the ballroom was used for nonprofit fundraisers two to three times a week from November through April. Mar-a-Lago rented out the ballroom but also provided the four- to five-course meals and drinks.\n\nGuests in evening wear paid between $500 to $1,000 to attend.\n\nAs of now, some nonprofits are staying the course, including West Palm Beach's Kravis Center For The Performing Arts, Big Dog Ranch Rescue (Trump daughter-in-law Lara Trump is the event's chairwoman) and Leaders in Furthering Education, National Enquirer heiress Lois Pope's Dec. 2 shindig.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:39:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2716, "textStart": 2710, "date": "-12-02", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "17:39:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "182546", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "303242", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "score": 2}, {"id": "304628", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "score": 3}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 2}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 3}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/jose-lambiet/hmysm/picture168016152/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/trump-married-web-mr", "timeCrawl": "21:37:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Major charities dump Trump's club after Charlottesville drama", "originalArticle": null}

Magen David Adom is Israel's ambulance, blood services and disaster-relief organization.\n\nLast season's gala, held Feb. 26, featured more than 600 attendees who paid $650 per ticket.\n\nAlso Thursday, a prominent business leader in Palm Beach urged other charitable organizations sticking with Mar-a-Lago to reconsider their commitment to the president's club. Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, told those groups and their deep-pocket donors to \"have a conscience\" and seek another venue for their events.\n\nThe decisions by the American Cancer Society, Cleveland Clinic and the AFMDA were three of the latest examples of pushback to Trump in the days since the president's off-the-cuff, combative and controversial news conference on Tuesday at Trump Tower, where he renewed his statements that \"both sides\" were at fault in the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, sparked by marches by neo-Nazis and white supremacists last weekend.\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" the American Cancer Society said in announcing it would move two 2018 events, a dinner for sponsors and its 60th anniversary gala, from the president's Palm Beach estate. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nThat announcement followed a decision by Cleveland Clinic, a leading research hospital in the United States with a location in West Palm Beach, to move its event, possibly to the Eau Palm Beach Resort and Spa.\n\nNick Gold, the public relations director of the oceanfront Eau Palm Beach , said it is working with the hospital in hopes of hosting next year's event.\n\n\"Their first call was to us,\" Gold said. \"We are talking to them. ... We certainly want to work with The Cleveland Clinic.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society said it has not settled on a new location and is evaluating venue options. No further information was available about whether AFMDA would try to hold an event elsewhere in Palm Beach County during the season.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's move follows previous assertions its event would go on at Trump's Palm Beach estate as planned, despite protests and letters of concern from some who demanded the venue be changed.\n\nThe hospital has hosted the fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago for the past eight years, according to The Associated Press, raising anywhere from $700,000 to $1 million a year.\n\nA representative for the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach said the nonprofit has no plans to move its fundraising event -- The Palm Beach Wine Auction -- which is scheduled to be held at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 1. Tickets to the auction are $1,000 a person.\n\nThe Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Loxahatchee Groves also still plans to have one of its major fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago. The \"Wine, Women and Shoes\" event is scheduled for March 10, said Robin Friedman, Big Dog Ranch's director of development.\n\n\"Most of our supporters know that we do what we do for our dogs, and that just happens to be the best venue,\" Friedman said of Mar-a-Lago. \"In fact, it's one of the only venues where we can do an event of our size in the daytime.\"\n\nThe president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is co-chairing the Big Dog Ranch Mar-a-Lago event with Georgina Bloomberg, daughter of billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nThe animal-rescue group is expecting 600 attendees -- up from 450 last year. The group raised $1.1 million at its Mar-a-Lago event last year, and Friedman said \"we are definitely expecting more\" for 2018.\n\nNonetheless, Palm Beach County event venues have made clear they would be receptive to discussing opportunities with charities considering a move.\n\nThe Eau, located on a 7-acre site with ocean views and lush tropical gardens in Manalapan, underwent a major transformation in 2013 -- dropping the Ritz-Carlton name and rebranding itself as a beachfront getaway for out-of-town guests and locals looking for a beachfront retreat. The property consistently ranks among the best resorts in the state. This spring, Chinese President Xi Jinping stayed at the resort during his two-day summit with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nGold said the resort can accommodate as many as 500 guests for a seated dinner. In addition to the Cleveland Clinic, the Eau has received inquiries from other charities looking to move events away from Mar-a-Lago, Gold said.\n\n\"We do see a lot of charities that are checking spaces to see what can be done,\" Gold said.\n\nDave Anderson, the general manager of the Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, said the venue is also hearing from groups who may be interested in moving events previously held at Mar-a-Lago. The convention center can host groups of roughly 1,000 people.\n\n\"We have a beautiful ballroom,\" Anderson said. \"We have a fantastic chef. ... It is a great venue for social events. The only thing I can't provide is an ocean at my doorstep.\"\n\nOne leader in Palm Beach's business community urged the charitable groups to consider a change of venue.\n\nThe Palm Beach Chamber's Baker minced no words Thursday about whether charities should abandon Mar-a-Lago this season.\n\n\"If you have a conscience, you're really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there,\" Baker said. \"Many say it's the dollars (raised at the events) that count. Yes. But the integrity of any or organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship.\"\n\nShe added: \"Personally, I do not feel that supporting him, directly or indirectly, speaks well of any organization.\"\n\nBaker's comments are the strongest yet from Palm Beach County's business community in the wake of Trump's conflicting and, to many, polarizing statements made in the aftermath of the weekend violence.\n\nLast Friday night, neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched through the northwestern Virginia town that is home to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. On Saturday, a suspected white supremacist rammed a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring 19.\n\nIn response, Trump first blamed Saturday's violence \"on many sides,\" but zeroed in on specific criticism of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis two days later after a backlash to his initial statement.\n\nHowever, Trump doubled down on his first set of comments during Tuesday's volatile news conference -- and then tweeted support for Confederate monuments on Thursday.\n\nNo one from the Palm Beach County business community had spoken out publicly -- until Baker.\n\nBaker also expressed no patience for charities that will try to keep a low profile during this turbulent period.\n\n\"I hope that people will not maintain their neutrality,\" she said. \"This is the best time ever for people to show their backbone.\"\n\nBaker encouraged all charities to re-examine their core purpose for guidance about how to react to Trump's comments.\n\nIn particular, she called out charities that advocate for social justice, the disabled, the poor and the sick.\n\n\"Look at your mission statement,\" Baker said. \"Are you living up to it?\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's departure from Mar-a-Lago was no surprise after CEO Toby Cosgrove distanced himself from Trump following Tuesday's comments. Cosgrove was one of a number of CEOs who stepped down from two White House business councils.\n\nTrump later said he was disbanding that council and another after a rash of defections by other business industry leaders, including the CEOs of 3M, Campbell Soup Co. and United Technologies.\n\n\"Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both,\" the president tweeted. \"Thank you all!\"\n\nBut the pressure for the Cleveland Clinic to move its event from Mar-a-Lago started this past spring, with petitions and backlash against the Ohio-based hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute as each planned lavish galas on the Palm Beach resort's grounds during the first months of Trump's presidency.",

The Salvation Army relies \"heavily on fundraising events\" like the ball as part of helping those in need, the group said in a statement.\n\n\"Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe American Red Cross also nixed plans to host an annual fundraising event at the resort calling it a \"source of controversy and pain\" for volunteers, employees and staff.\n\n\"We believe this action will allow us to continue to put the focus on our lifesaving mission and the people we serve,\" according to a statement. \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe organization offers many social services, including food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, clothing and shelter to the homeless and opportunities for the underprivileged.\n\nOn Thursday, three large funding organizations -- the American Cancer Society, Cleveland Clinic and American Friends of Magen David Adom -- pulled their events.\n\nThe American Cancer Society's event, held at Trump's Palm Beach estate for 11 years, nets about $450,000 for the organization, according to the American Cancer Society's local office.\n\nThe organization has started looking for an another site for the fundraiser. It was held at Mar-a-Lago because of costs, venue requirements and other factors, according to the statement.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic didn't give a reason for its decision. Before changing course, Cleveland Clinic spokeswoman Eileen Sheil had said last week that the hospital system's event was not political.

It has been held at Mar-a-Lago the past eight years.\n\nTwo other organizations said Friday that their events will proceed as scheduled.\n\nA spokesman for The Kravis Center for the Performing Arts said that as of Thursday afternoon, officials had not changed their minds. \"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the people who are regulars at the event want to keep it there,\" said Gary Schweikhart, spokesman for the Kravis Center.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said it, too, will stay the course. \"The ball typically attracts 700 people, and it's the only venue in Palm Beach that will accommodate a crowd of that size,\" according to a statement issued from the foundation, which supports Palm Beach Police Department employees.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Komen, the International Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Autism Association of Palm Beach County and Big Dog Ranch -- moved events from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, American Cancer Society and the American Friends of Magen David Adom, an organization supporting Israel disaster relief programs, also have changed venues for their events.\n\nThe Raymond F.

Komen and the Autism Association of Palm Beach County. \"In fact, it's one of the only venues where we can do an event of our size in the daytime\".\n\nThe new announcements bring the total number of groups that have canceled events at Mar-a-Lago to seven.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists are repugnant and repulsive - and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for\", LIFE President Lois Pope said in a statement.\n\nThe proceeds of the Lady in Red Gala are slated to go to \"an array of initiatives benefiting military families and military dogs\", according to the charity's website.\n\nThe charitable groups joined three other large event cancellations Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club. Mar-a-Lago rented out the ballroom but also provided the four- to five-course meals and drinks.\n\nStackla Emerges as a Go-To Firm for Charities Seeking Viral Impact: The social-media-marketing company, which made its name developing user-generated content into online promotions for major corporations, launched a new division, Stackla for Good, to handle its growing portfolio of hashtag-heavy cause campaigns for groups such as Greenpeace, ONE, and the World Wildlife Fund, Fast Company writes. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations\", the American Cancer Society said in a statement.\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which has hosted its annual event at Mar-a-Lago for at least the past decade - has not selected another venue. The club, which has sought dozens of H-2B visas for foreign employees because it argued that it can't find Americans to do the work, was absent last week at a job fair in West Palm Beach.\n\nTrump retained an ownership interest in his business when he took office, which means he has a personal stake in Mar-a-Lago's success.\n\nThe event was scheduled to take place at Mar-a-Lago on February 25, 2018.\n\nThe gilded and glittering Mar-a-Lago has been a favorite spot for holding charity events and a money maker for the Trump Organization.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation said it, too, will stay the course.\n\nAs of now, some nonprofits are staying the course, including West Palm Beach's Kravis Center For The Performing Arts, Big Dog Ranch Rescue (Trump daughter-in-law Lara Trump is the event's chairwoman) and Leaders in Furthering Education, National Enquirer heiress Lois Pope's December 2 shindig.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T21:47:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2794,

Pope, a self-described Trump loyalist, issued a statement Friday saying she had recommended to the organization's board of directors that they seek a new location.\n\nClick here to see which charities are in, which are out of Mar-a-Lago for this season\n\nA total of eight groups have now pulled their events Mar-a-Lago since the president's off-the-cuff, combative and controversial news conference on Tuesday at Trump Tower.\n\nOn Friday, Susan G. Komen, the world's largest nonprofit in the fight against breast cancer, the International Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Autism Association of Palm Beach County, and Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Loxahatchee Groves, announced they would not hold their events at Trump's Palm Beach club during the winter fundraising season.\n\nThose announcements came a day after the Cleveland Clinic, American Cancer Society and the American Friends of Magen David Adom, an organization supporting Israel disaster relief programs, said they would seek alternative venues. The Cleveland Clinic plans to hold its Feb. 23 ball at The Breakers in Palm Beach.\n\nThe International Red Cross announcement, in particular, marks the end of an era. Mar-a-Lago's original owner, Marjorie Merriweather Post, hosted the IRC's first ball there and Trump has been a frequent chairman of the event. And Big Dog Rescue, which counts Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump as a gala co-chair, decided Friday to move its fundraiser only a after it reiterated its intention to stick with Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe decisions coincided with a firestorm of criticism on social media. Many Twitter users called on people to boycott the charities, pointing to Trump's controversial statements on the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend, including that \"both sides\" were at fault in the confrontations between neo-Nazis, white supremacists and counter protesters.\n\nA third organization joins charities leaving Mar-a-Lago\n\nTrump's statements that there were also \"some very fine people\" on both sides was especially stinging when juxtaposed against the anti-Semitic chants of \"Blood and soil\" and \"Jews will not replace us\" by marching, torch-carrying neo-Nazis and others on Aug. 11.\n\nPope issued a sharply worded statement to that effect on Friday.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists are repugnant and repulsive - and they are antithetical to everything that this country stands for. And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations,\" Pope said in a prepared statement. \"I want my children, grandchildren and great grandson to know that standing up to hatred and discrimination in all forms is both a personal responsibility and the right thing to do. Therefore, I am recommending to my board that we move this year's gala from the Mar-A-Lago Club.\"\n\nIn a statement Friday, Laurie Simmons, who heads Big Dog Ranch Rescue, said the group now plans to hold its annual luncheon at its new Loxahatchee Groves shelter.\n\n\"In the interest of being better able to focus on our core mission of helping animals and saving dogs, we have decided to hold our next annual luncheon at our new facility in Loxahatchee Groves,\" Simmons said. \"Holding the event at our facility will also give our donors a first-hand look at our world-class dog rescue operation.\"\n\nIronically, the platform of choice to pressure the organizations became social media, including Twitter, which Trump himself uses on a daily basis to reach out to supporters and castigate opponents.\n\nOn Twitter, some critics used the hashtag #DropMarALago in their calls to charities to abandon the club, which has long been an oasis for charities and their patrons during Palm Beach's winter charity season.\n\nOthers said they would no longer donate to the Salvation Army and vowed to stop shopping at its thrift stores if the non-profit didn't change venues.\n\n\"Do the right thing,\" one person wrote to The Salvation Army on Twitter. \"Stand against hatred & bigotry, Nazis and KKK. Don't continue to host your events at Mar-A-Lago.\"\n\n\"Please do the right thing and cancel your Mar-a-largo (sic) event,\" another Twitter user said. \"If not @goodwill gets my business from now on.\"\n\nOne local charity will keep event at Mar-a-Lago, with Lara Trump as co-chair\n\nSeveral of those taking aim Susan G. Komen used the hashtag #RacistForTheCure, a reference to Komen's annual Race For The Cure events, to put pressure on the group to change venues.\n\n\"Have the breast cancer grifters over at @SusanGKomen cancelled their gala at Mar-A- Lago yet? #RacistForTheCure,\" one tweet read.\n\nLocal non-profits, including the Palm Beach Zoo and the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach, were also targeted on Twitter for plans to hold events at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPB chamber head to charities: 'Have conscience' about Mar-a-Lago\n\n\"@KravisCenter If you're not against the #nazis, you're WITH the Nazis, Move #MaraLago event,\" one person wrote.\n\nThe linkage of Trump's Mar-a-Lago and Nazism are a particularly sharp rebuke of the performing arts center decision to hold it's event at the president's club.\n\nThe Kravis center's roots go back to the Palm Beach Country Club, created by Jewish residents of Palm Beach who were excluded from other private clubs.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with the Palm Beach Post, Kravis backer Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. recalled why club members decided to donate to the performing arts center in honor of Raymond F. Kravis, an Oklahoma oil man and Palm Beach Country Club member.\n\nEvery year, club members would go around asking other members to donate to their causes. And every year, Kravis would contribute generously, Dreyfoos said.\n\n\"But Kravis never had his own cause,\" Dreyfoos said.\n\nSo when the time came to name the center, \"they named it for him,\" Dreyfoos said. \"They wanted to reciprocate.\"\n\nSome Twitter users pointed to Friday's mass resignation of the President's Committee On the Arts and Humanities in their calls for the Kravis Center to move its fundraiser. The arts board's membership cited Trump's remarks about the violence in Charlottesville, Va. for their departure.\n\n\"Hey @KravisCenter follow the lead of fellow arts leaders today!,\" one tweet read. \"Find a new place for your gala!\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T12:39:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1470, "textStart": 1463, "date": "-02-23", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2612, "textStart":

Company spokeswoman Eileen Sheil told The Post on Thursday that \"there were a variety of factors\" behind the cancellation, but she added, \"We're not elaborating.\"\n\nShortly after, the American Cancer Society, another long-time charity customer of the club, said it would pull its own event and explore \"other opportunities and potential venues.\"\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" the group said in a statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nBoth health-related groups faced growing pressure to rethink their support of the president's business amid numerous controversies. But the cancellations don't come without risk: The Cleveland Clinic said it had raised about $1 million a year for medical equipment over the last eight years at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMar-a-Lago's 2017-2018 season now looks like it will be the slowest period for charity events in at least a decade, according to a Washington Post analysis of upcoming events. It's unclear how much the cancellations could cost the club, though similar-sized events brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000.\n\nTrump's comments also appear to have helped turn the Palm Beach business community against one of its most opulent venues.\n\nBaker, head of the Palm Beach chamber, spoke vigorously against Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, saying that her directive to nearby charities was, \"If you're looking at your mission statement, can you honestly say having an event at Mar-a-Lago, given all that has transpired, is the best stewardship of your efforts?\"\n\n\"The club is a member of the chamber. But right is right,\" she added in an interview with The Post. \"My mantra this week is from Dante: 'The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.' Especially for nonprofits. Especially for groups who help people who can't help themselves.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's cancellation was an abrupt change, and the hospital system had still intended to host its ninth gala there as recently as last week. The move followed weeks of public turmoil, including a letter signed by 1,600 health professionals and others last month that said the Mar-a-Lago booking \"symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's chief executive, Toby Cosgrove, was among the business leaders on the president's Strategic and Policy Forum that agreed to disband on Wednesday. As members of the group resigned, Trump said on Twitter that he would end the forum and a separate American Manufacturing Council \"rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic was ranked the nation's second-best hospital this month by U.S. News & World Report, which gave top honors to its urology, cardiology and heart surgery units.\n\nNearly 550 people visited the hospital's February fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, where the theme was \"Reflections of Versailles.\"\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Three fundraising giants decided Thursday to withdraw their previously planned fundraising galas at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society, and the American Friends of Magen David Adom (AFMDA) are the philanthropic organizations that decided to pull events from the president's mansion. The cancellations -- that may cut down the revenue for the private club -- can be viewed as a direct blowback to Trump's business.\n\nThe mansion has been a venue for such gala events in the past and has earned revenues between $100,000 and $275,000 each from such events, Chicago Tribune reported. The president calls the club \"Winter White House.\"\n\nThe mansion that has lavish interiors and can hold a large crowd. Each guest suite is \"exquisitely appointed in keeping with the original character of this lavish estate while assuring the luxury of modern day world-class amenities,\" according to its official website.\n\nAround 21 charities held events at the mansion between November and April during the active social season, ABC News reported citing Palm Beach town records.\n\nThe American Cancer Society is one of the high-dollar clients at the Mar-a-Lago club since 2009. It cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in a statement, as reported by various media publications, on its decision to pull out its fundraising gala from the club.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's leading medical centers, also took a U-turn from its decision of holding its winter event in the club. Earlier, it had said it planned to continue business at the club, reports said.\n\nAFMDA, which is Israel's national ambulance, blood-services, and disaster-relief organization, also said, it decided not to hold its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"after considerable deliberation\". The charity had a big event last season at the club with about 600 people attending it, reports said.\n\nApart from being a host to some of the biggest gala events, the club has also become the site of protests by groups who are against Trump's policies and statements. For instance, in January, the American Red Cross faced criticism when protesters rallied outside its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago as the charity organization was helping those affected by Trump's U.S. refugee program, ABC News reported.\n\nHowever, the organization did not respond to questions about whether it will have its fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago next year as well or not.\n\nMeanwhile, some other charities said they do not plan to cancel its events at the club such as the Kravis Center who would continue to have its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago, a report said.\n\n\"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation also said that it would have its annual ball at the president's mansion because it is not a political event and that no other venue would accommodate as many as 700 guests.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T07:12:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "07:12:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 3}, {"id": "303242", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "score": 2}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 5}, {"id": "304736", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "score": 3}, {"id": "305746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "score": 2}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "310151", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Auction"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "score": 1}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 4}, {"id": "322818", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 4}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/08/18/charlottesville.jpg", "timeCrawl": "07:12:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Charlottesville Comments Blowback: Trump's Business To Take Direct Hit From Cancelled Events", "originalArticle": null}

[Doug Mills | New York Times]\n\nThe Salvation Army, the American Red Cross and Susan G. Komen on Friday joined a growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, deepening the financial impact to President Donald Trump's private business amid furor over his comments on Charlottesville.\n\nThe major exits now mean seven of the club's biggest event customers have abandoned it this week, likely costing the Trump business hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue or more.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast-cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE:Trump retreats to Mar-a-lago over and over but at what cost?\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need - regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions - and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe charitable groups joined three other large event cancellations Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is no longer planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto told The Post Friday.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Greetings from Mar-a-lago, Donald Trump's presidential paradise\n\nThe move from the local group, which has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008, suggests that pressure on the club is growing even among groups with deep roots in Palm Beach.\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe cancellations hit at one of the private Florida club's top moneymakers: The club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past during Palm Beach's glitzy social seasons.\n\nBut they also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counterprotesters were similarly at blame during a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T21:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "dateCrawl":

The foundation was a new customer for Trump's club, and a potentially lucrative one: It spent $244,000 on rent and food on a previous gala at another site, according to tax filings.\n\nBut on Saturday, the foundation said it would find another venue.\n\n\"Given the current environment surrounding Mar-a-Lago, we have made the decision to move our annual dinner dance,\" Amanda Skier, the foundation's executive director, said in a written statement. She did not say which new venue the foundation would use.\n\nThat decision meant that Trump's club had lost nine of the 16 galas or dinner events that it had been scheduled to host during next winter's social \"season\" in Palm Beach. At least two other groups have also canceled charity luncheons there this week.\n\nThose losses could reduce the club's revenue by hundreds of thousands of dollars by each event, and deny President Trump his dual role as president and host to the island's partying elite. If he returns to the club for weekends next winter, the president could often find its grand ballrooms quiet and empty.\n\nThese cancellations all followed the president's remarks on the march of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which the president said the protesters, who gathered under the pretense of wanting to preserve a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, included some \"fine people.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross and Susan G. Komen joined the growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the club.\n\nSusan G.

Lois Pope, a Mar-a-Lago member and philanthropist who heads the Lois Pope Life Foundation and Leaders In Furthering Education, said she had told her foundation's board to move its well-known December gala from the club.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive,\" Pope wrote in a statement. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nOne of the cancellations cut close to home for the Trumps. Big Dog Ranch Rescue said Friday it would no longer hold an upcoming event at the club and would instead move it to the group's facility nearby. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was scheduled to co-chair the event.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is not planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto told The Post on Friday. The local group has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008.\n\nThe Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation on Friday also announced it had canceled its annual medical briefing luncheon at the club and will move it to another venue.\n\n\"We stand with the community,\" the foundation's co-founder, Dusty Sang, told The Post Friday. \"I think people are standing up for what they believe.\"\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counterprotesters equally shared the blame for a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:58:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "20:58:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302509", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "score": 4}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 3}, {"id": "305969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "score": 3}, {"id": "306226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "310713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "score": 2}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 2}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 2}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 2}, {"id": "360432", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

We believe this action will allow us to continue to put the focus on our lifesaving mission and the people we serve. The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe Salvation Army\n\n\"The Salvation Army relies heavily on fundraising events like The Holiday Snow Ball in Palm Beach to further our mission of helping those in need through a range of social services including food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, clothing and shelter for the homeless, and opportunities for the underprivileged. Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\n\n\"With our volunteer leaders, we are exploring other opportunities and potential venues. The generous support of community volunteers and donors are critical to our life-saving mission. Only by coming together will we solve our society's most difficult challenges, including reducing the pain and suffering from cancer.\"\n\nCleveland Clinic\n\n\"After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018. We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.\"\n\nLeaders in Furthering Education (LIFE)\n\nThe organization's president, Lois Pope, is urging the board to abandon Mar-a-Lago for a gala in December. Pope said:\n\n\"America was founded on the principles of life, liberty and justice for all. In the 241 years since, millions of Americans of all religions, races, creeds, color, gender and sexual orientation have died -- and millions more have been disabled -- fighting to protect these values and freedoms.\n\n\"Now, however, our great nation is under siege by those who seek to undermine and obliterate these principles. Indeed, the hatred, vitriol and Anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive -- and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for. And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\n\n\"Therefore, I am recommending to my board that we move this year's 24th Annual Lady in Red Gala on December 2 -- the proceeds of which benefit those very millions of men and women of all persuasions who have fought with courage and sacrifice in defense of America's ideals -- from the Mar-A-Lago Club.\n\n\"I want my children, grandchildren and great grandson to know that standing up to hatred and discrimination in all forms is both a personal responsibility and the right thing to do.\"\n\n-CNNMoney's Jackie Wattles contributed to this report.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:32:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3299, "textStart": 3289, "date": "-12-02", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "20:32:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302509", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "score": 5}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 5}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "303332", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "score": 3}, {"id": "304550", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "score": 2}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "305969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "score": 3}, {"id": "306144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "score": 3}, {"id": "306436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "310713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "score": 2}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 4}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 3}, {"id": "783438", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Lois Pope"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Pope", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://gantdaily.com/images/gant-og-logo.jpg", "timeCrawl": "20:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "In their words: Why charities are walking away from Trump", "originalArticle": null}

Charities and other organizations have started backing out of plans to host events at the Trump-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nA chamber of commerce works to promote its members' interests, but Baker says that it's her duty to take a stand when she feels the values of her community are under attack.\n\n\"We're looking for integrity, we're looking for honesty,\" she said.\n\nBaker made similar comments to the Palm Beach Post and then to the Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking with CNNMoney on Friday, Baker said the bulk of the reaction she received has been \"very positive.\"\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment on Baker's statements. It referred questions to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe said she recognizes her comments run counter to some people's line of thinking: That business and politics don't mix. Baker contends the two \"just can't be separated\" -- particularly in light of this week's events.\n\nAnd some of the biggest names in the private sector haven't shied away from politics either.\n\nProminent business leaders began fleeing from Trump's business advisory councils this week in protest to his response to the white supremacist rally. Trump disbanded two councils amid the outflux.\n\nThough Trump no longer has day-to-day involvement in Mar-a-Lago, which is controlled by the Trump Organization, his sons continue to operate the family business. And, as ethics experts have pointed out, the president stands to eventually reap the benefits of any profits made by those properties.\n\nBased on Trump's latest financial disclosure form from June, Mar-a-Lago has done well for him in the past. In that document, Trump reported $37.2 million in income from Mar-a-Lago between January 2016 and April 2017.\n\nTrump has also made Mar-a-Lago into something of a second office. Since his January inauguration, Trump has spent more than 20 days at the resort and hosted world leaders there, referring to it as the \"winter White House.\"\n\nBaker said she's prepared for criticism.\n\n\"I'm just a gray-haired grandmother,\" she said. \"There's very little fear left in my life.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T00:31:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2395, "textStart": 2368, "date": "2016-01-", "dateEnd": "2017-04-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "00:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "242096", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302720", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Business"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "score": 5}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303777", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Resort"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort", "score": 5}, {"id": "304270", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "score": 3}, {"id": "305969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "score": 3}, {"id": "328193", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://gantdaily.com/images/gant-og-logo.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Palm Beach chamber leader to charities: Rethink your business with Trump", "originalArticle": null}

The foundation was a new customer for Trump's club, and a potentially lucrative one: It spent $244,000 on rent and food on a previous gala at another site, according to tax filings.\n\nBut on Saturday, the foundation said it would find another venue.\n\n\"Given the current environment surrounding Mar-a-Lago, we have made the decision to move our annual dinner dance,\" Amanda Skier, the foundation's executive director, said in a written statement. She did not say which new venue the foundation would use.\n\nThat decision meant that Trump's club had lost nine of the 16 galas or dinner events that it had been scheduled to host during next winter's social \"season\" in Palm Beach. At least two other groups have also canceled charity luncheons there this week.\n\nThose losses could reduce the club's revenue by hundreds of thousands of dollars by each event, and deny President Trump his dual role as president and host to the island's partying elite. If he returns to the club for weekends next winter, the president could often find its grand ballrooms quiet and empty.\n\nThese cancellations all followed the president's remarks on the march of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, in which the president said their side had included some \"fine people.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross and Susan G. Komen joined the growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the club.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast-cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need -- regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions -- and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\n[Three fundraising giants cancel plans for galas at Mar-a-Lago]\n\nTrump's club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past.\n\nBut the cancellations also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe Trump Organization has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe charitable groups join three other large event cancellations from Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nSome of the club's most notable local boosters, with long fundraising histories and deep Palm Beach roots, were also in outright rebellion Friday against the club. Lois Pope, a Mar-a-Lago member and philanthropist who heads the Lois Pope Life Foundation and Leaders In Furthering Education, said she had told her foundation's board to move its well-known December gala from the club.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive,\" Pope wrote in a statement. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nOne of the cancellations cut close to home for the Trumps.

The foundation was a new customer for Trump's club, and a potentially lucrative one: It spent $244,000 on rent and food on a previous gala at another site, according to tax filings.\n\nBut Saturday, the foundation said it would find another venue.\n\n\"Given the current environment surrounding Mar-a-Lago, we have made the decision to move our annual dinner dance,\" said Amanda Skier, the foundation's executive director. She did not say which new venue the foundation would use.\n\nThat decision meant that Trump's club had lost nine of the 16 galas or dinner events that it had been scheduled to host during next winter's social \"season\" in Palm Beach. At least two other groups have also canceled charity luncheons there this week.\n\nThose losses could reduce the club's revenue by hundreds of thousands of dollars by each event, and deny President Trump his dual role as president and host to the island's partying elite. If he returns to the club for weekends next winter, the president could often find its grand ballrooms quiet and empty.\n\nThese cancellations all followed the president's remarks on the march of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which the president said the protesters, who gathered under the pretense of wanting to preserve a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, included some \"fine people.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross and Susan G. Komen joined the growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the club.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need -- regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions -- and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nTrump's club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past.\n\nBut the cancellations also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe charitable groups join three other large event cancellations from Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nSome of the club's most notable local boosters, with long fundraising histories and deep Palm Beach roots, were also in outright rebellion Friday against the club. Lois Pope, a Mar-a-Lago member and philanthropist who heads the Lois Pope Life Foundation and Leaders In Furthering Education, said she had told her foundation's board to move its well-known December gala from the club.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive,\" Pope wrote. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nOne of the cancellations cut close to home for the Trumps. Big Dog Ranch Rescue said Friday it would no longer hold an upcoming event at the club and would instead move it to the group's facility nearby. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was scheduled to co-chair the event.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is not planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto said Friday. The local group has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008.\n\nThe Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation on Friday also announced it had canceled its annual medical briefing luncheon at the club and will move it to another venue.\n\n\"We stand with the community,\" the foundation's co-founder, Dusty Sang, said Friday. \"I think people are standing up for what they believe.\"\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counterprotesters equally shared the blame for a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:58:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "00:58:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302509", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "score": 4}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "302813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "303332", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "score": 2}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 3}, {"id": "305960", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "score": 3}, {"id": "305969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "score": 3}, {"id": "306226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "310713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "score": 2}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 2}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 2}, {"id": "360432", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

In one such controversial remark that he made Tuesday, he said both sides were to blame for the outbreak of violence that was reported after white nationalists took to streets against city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\nOn Thursday, three philanthropic organizations -- The Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society, and the American Friends of Magen David Adom (AFMDA) -- decided to pull their fundraising events at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to multiple reports. The cancellations, which are likely to cut down the revenue for the private club, can be viewed as a direct blowback to Trump's business.\n\nThe mansion has been a venue for such gala events in the past and has earned revenues between $100,000 and $275,000 from such events, Chicago Tribune reported. The president calls the club \"Winter White House.\"\n\nThe mansion with lavish interiors can hold a large crowd of about 700 attendees. Each guest suite is \"exquisitely appointed in keeping with the original character of this lavish estate while assuring the luxury of modern day world-class amenities,\" according to its official website.\n\nAround 21 charities held events at the mansion between November and April during the active social season, ABC News reported citing Palm Beach town records.\n\nThe American Cancer Society has been one of the high-dollar clients at the Mar-a-Lago Club since 2009. Referring to the decision to pull out its fundraising gala from the club, the organization cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in a statement, according to several reports.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's leading medical centers, also decided against holding its winter event in the club. Earlier, it had said it planned to continue the business with the club, reports said.\n\nAFMDA, which is Israel's national ambulance, blood-services, and disaster-relief organization, also said that it had decided not to hold its 2018 gala at Mar-a-Lago \"after considerable deliberation.\" The charity held a huge event at the club last season with about 600 people attending it, reports said.\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago Club has also been a protest venue for the groups that are against Trump's policies and statements. For instance, in January, the American Red Cross faced criticism when protesters rallied outside its annual fundraiser at the club. The charity organization held the event to help people affected by Trump's U.S. refugee program, ABC News reported. However, the organization did not respond to questions about whether it would hold its next fundraiser at the club.\n\nMeanwhile, several charities have said they would continue to hold their fundraisers at the \"Winter White House.\" Kravis Center would hold its annual wine auction at the Mar-a-Lago, a report said. \"The event has been held there for a number of years, and the folks supporting it want to continue to have it there,\" spokesman Gary Schweikhart said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation also said it would hold its annual ball at the president's mansion because it was not a political event and no other venue would accommodate as many as 700 guests.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T07:59:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "07:59:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 2}, {"id": "302547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "score": 2}, {"id": "302906", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "score": 1}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "303062", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "score": 2}, {"id": "303242", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "score": 2}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 4}, {"id": "304736", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "score": 3}, {"id": "305746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "score": 2}, {"id": "305960", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "310151", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Auction"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "score": 1}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 4}, {"id": "322818", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "score": 3}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 4}, {"id": "360432", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Charities and other organizations have started backing out of plans to host events at the Trump-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nA chamber of commerce works to promote its members' interests, but Baker says that it's her duty to take a stand when she feels the values of her community are under attack.\n\n\"We're looking for integrity, we're looking for honesty,\" she said.\n\nBaker made similar comments to the Palm Beach Post and then to the Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking with CNNMoney on Friday, Baker said the bulk of the reaction she received has been \"very positive.\"\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment on Baker's statements. It referred questions to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe said she recognizes her comments run counter to some people's line of thinking: That business and politics don't mix. Baker contends the two \"just can't be separated\" -- particularly in light of this week's events.\n\nAnd some of the biggest names in the private sector haven't shied away from politics either.\n\nProminent business leaders began fleeing from Trump's business advisory councils this week in protest to his response to the white supremacist rally. Trump disbanded two councils amid the outflux.\n\nThough Trump no longer has day-to-day involvement in Mar-a-Lago, which is controlled by the Trump Organization, his sons continue to operate the family business. And, as ethics experts have pointed out, the president stands to eventually reap the benefits of any profits made by those properties.\n\nBased on Trump's latest financial disclosure form from June, Mar-a-Lago has done well for him in the past. In that document, Trump reported $37.2 million in income from Mar-a-Lago between January 2016 and April 2017.\n\nTrump has also made Mar-a-Lago into something of a second office. Since his January inauguration, Trump has spent more than 20 days at the resort and hosted world leaders there, referring to it as the \"winter White House.\"\n\nBaker said she's prepared for criticism.\n\n\"I'm just a gray-haired grandmother,\" she said. \"There's very little fear left in my life.\"\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

We believe this action will allow us to continue to put the focus on our lifesaving mission and the people we serve. The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe Salvation Army\n\n\"The Salvation Army relies heavily on fundraising events like The Holiday Snow Ball in Palm Beach to further our mission of helping those in need through a range of social services including food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, clothing and shelter for the homeless, and opportunities for the underprivileged. Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nThe American Cancer Society\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\n\n\"With our volunteer leaders, we are exploring other opportunities and potential venues. The generous support of community volunteers and donors are critical to our life-saving mission. Only by coming together will we solve our society's most difficult challenges, including reducing the pain and suffering from cancer.\"\n\nCleveland Clinic\n\n\"After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018. We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.\"\n\nLeaders in Furthering Education (LIFE)\n\nThe organization's president, Lois Pope, is urging the board to abandon Mar-a-Lago for a gala in December. Pope said:\n\n\"America was founded on the principles of life, liberty and justice for all. In the 241 years since, millions of Americans of all religions, races, creeds, color, gender and sexual orientation have died -- and millions more have been disabled -- fighting to protect these values and freedoms.\n\n\"Now, however, our great nation is under siege by those who seek to undermine and obliterate these principles. Indeed, the hatred, vitriol and Anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive -- and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for. And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\n\n\"Therefore, I am recommending to my board that we move this year's 24th Annual Lady in Red Gala on December 2 -- the proceeds of which benefit those very millions of men and women of all persuasions who have fought with courage and sacrifice in defense of America's ideals -- from the Mar-A-Lago Club.\n\n\"I want my children, grandchildren and great grandson to know that standing up to hatred and discrimination in all forms is both a personal responsibility and the right thing to do.\"\n\n--CNNMoney's Jackie Wattles contributed to this report.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Indeed, the hatred, vitriol and Anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive -- and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for,\" Lois Pope, a philanthropist and veterans advocate who founded LIFE, wrote in a statement provided to ABC News.\n\nOther groups that have pulled events from Mar-a-Lago include the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, American Friends of Magen David Adom and the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.\n\nThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society cited the security hassles of hosting an event at Mar-a-Lago as a reason for their switching venues.\n\nPalm Beach Chamber of Commerce executive director Laurel Baker, who has been outspoken on organizations continuing to hold fundraising events at Mar-a-Lago, told ABC News: \"I've been carrying around this quote with me for a while, it's from Dante: 'The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.'\"\n\nBaker also told ABC News that she expects more and more organizations will be pulling events in the coming weeks, but that those decisions are best left up to the organizations themselves.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:09:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "23:09:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 3}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "303110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "score": 5}, {"id": "303332", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "score": 2}, {"id": "304736", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "score": 3}, {"id": "305083", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Life (magazine)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305090", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "score": 4}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "306144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 4}, {"id": "310713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 2}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 5}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 4}, {"id": "319689", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Susan G.

Gloria Tavera is a Case Western Reserve University medical student who helped spearhead the petition against using Trump's Palm Beach estate as a venue.\n\nTavera commented to Cleveland.com that the Clinic didn't change venues when immigration and health care were the pressing issues, but \"Charlottesville was the one that broke the camel's back.\"\n\nTrump did an about-face from his scripted comments on Monday denouncing bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. In remarks to the press on Tuesday, Trump doubled down on his sentiment that the actions of neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were ethically equal to the people protesting neo-Nazis, which he originally implied in his \"many sides\" comment on Saturday.\n\nFormer Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke thanked Trump on Tuesday via Twitter for his \"honesty and courage.\"\n\nThe exit of charities from Mar-a-Lago also follows Wednesday's decision by CEOs of some of the nation's leading corporations to disband Trump's business advisory council.\n\nLaurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, urged other charitable organizations that are not withdrawing from Mar-a-Lago, and their donors, to seek another venue.\n\n\"If you have a conscience, you're really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there,\" Baker said. \"Many say it's the dollars [raised at the events] that count. Yes. But the integrity of any or organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship.\n\n\"Personally, I do not feel that supporting him, directly or indirectly, speaks well of any organization.\"\n\nMar-a-Lago Seeks to Hire Foreign Nationals\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago club also represents some of the double standards of the Trump administration. Trump has said that immigrants are taking jobs from native workers.\n\nIn July, during \"Made in America Week,\" BuzzFeed first reported that the club requested 70 visas to hire foreign nationals this fall -- 35 waiters, 20 cooks and 15 housekeepers. Trump's golf club in Jupiter, Fla., asked permission to hire six foreign workers as cooks. If approved, the workers at both Trump-owned locations would fill the jobs between this October and May 2018.\n\nH-2B visa nonimmigrant program permits employers to hire foreign workers to come temporarily to the U.S. and perform temporary nonagricultural services or labor on a one-time, seasonal, peak load or intermittent basis.\n\nApplications for H-2B visa workers are allowed when \"there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified and available to do the temporary work,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSo, last month, the club placed an ad on page C8 of the Palm Beach Post in tiny print stating: \"3 mos recent & verifiable exp in fine dining/country club,\" and \"No tips.\"\n\nThe ad included no phone number or email address. \"Apply by fax,\" it said, and provided a mailing address. The ad only ran twice.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump blamed immigrants for the lack of jobs available to nonwhite voters and working-class Americans.\n\nIn July 2015 at a rally in Phoenix, he accused Mexicans of taking jobs.\n\n\"They're taking our jobs,\" he said. \"They're taking our manufacturing jobs. They're taking our money. They're killing us.\"\n\nLast year, The New York Times reported that U.S. residents are less likely to be hired at Mar-a-Lago:\n\n\"Since 2010, nearly 300 United States residents have applied or been referred for jobs as waiters, waitresses, cooks and housekeepers there. But according to federal records, only 17 have been hired.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T16:18:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3820, "textStart": 3800, "date": "2018-10-", "dateEnd": "2018-05-",

After Trump announced his run for president in 2015, more events have left Mar-a-Lago than the club has gained.\n\nMost of the organizations leaving Mar-a-Lago cite increased security around the club, not politics, as the biggest factor in their decision. Trump still visits the club regularly after all, so security is tight. But that also means it takes longer to get in.\n\nThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society decided to move its 2018 charity gala for this very reason. The nonprofit had held its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago for eight years. But the charity said with the tightened security some people only got into the event's silent auction with just 20 minutes left to bid.\n\nBut for some nonprofits, Trump's politics may play a role. In January and again in July, a total of nearly 3,500 people signed open letters to the Cleveland Clinic asking it to reconsider its choice of venue for fundraising.\n\nThat most recent letter said hosting the event there supported a politician who was working to \"decrease access to health care\" and cut billions in health care research funding.\n\nOther charities seem to just want to stay out of the president's general sphere of influence. Last year, the Susan G. Komen Foundation decided to move its annual fundraising party not because of Trump's politics, but to avoid \"controversies unrelated to our mission.\"\n\nThings haven't been all bad for the club since Trump's presidential bid. A report filed in June shows that the club made over $37 million in 2016 and early 2017.

We believe this action will allow us to continue to put the focus on our lifesaving mission and the people we serve. The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need, regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, or political opinions, and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe Salvation Army\n\n\"The Salvation Army relies heavily on fundraising events like The Holiday Snow Ball in Palm Beach to further our mission of helping those in need through a range of social services including food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, clothing and shelter for the homeless, and opportunities for the underprivileged. Because the conversation has shifted away from the purpose of this event, we will not host it at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\n\n\"With our volunteer leaders, we are exploring other opportunities and potential venues. The generous support of community volunteers and donors are critical to our life-saving mission. Only by coming together will we solve our society's most difficult challenges, including reducing the pain and suffering from cancer.\"\n\nCleveland Clinic\n\n\"After careful consideration, Cleveland Clinic has decided that it will not hold a Florida fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018. We thank the staff of Mar-a-Lago for their service over the years.\"\n\nLeaders in Furthering Education (LIFE)\n\nThe organization's president, Lois Pope, is urging the board to abandon Mar-a-Lago for a gala in December. Pope said:\n\n\"America was founded on the principles of life, liberty and justice for all. In the 241 years since, millions of Americans of all religions, races, creeds, color, gender and sexual orientation have died -- and millions more have been disabled -- fighting to protect these values and freedoms.\n\n\"Now, however, our great nation is under siege by those who seek to undermine and obliterate these principles. Indeed, the hatred, vitriol and Anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive -- and they are antithetical to everything that this country, and I personally stand for. And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\n\n\"Therefore, I am recommending to my board that we move this year's 24th Annual Lady in Red Gala on December 2 -- the proceeds of which benefit those very millions of men and women of all persuasions who have fought with courage and sacrifice in defense of America's ideals -- from the Mar-A-Lago Club.\n\n\"I want my children, grandchildren and great grandson to know that standing up to hatred and discrimination in all forms is both a personal responsibility and the right thing to do.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T19:48:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3270, "textStart": 3260, "date": "-12-02", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.658823549747467, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "19:48:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302509", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "score": 5}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 5}, {"id": "302940", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "score": 2}, {"id": "303332", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "score": 2}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 2}, {"id": "305969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "score": 3}, {"id": "306144", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "score": 3}, {"id": "306436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 5}, {"id": "310713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "score": 2}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 4}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "324390", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "score": 3}, {"id": "783438", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Lois Pope"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Pope", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170818150952-mar-a-lago-540x304.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "In their words: Why charities are walking away from Trump properties ", "originalArticle": null}

His advisory councils collapsed. Some of his customers said they won't give him their business anymore.\n\nTrump's Treasury secretary got called out by his fellow Yale Class of '85 graduates. His friend Carl Icahn, one of Trump's earliest supporters from Wall Street, said he will no longer serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues.\n\nEven a member of the Palm Beach chamber of commerce, which counts Trump's Mar-a-Lago club as a member, called on charities to consult their mission statements before deciding to do business with Trump.\n\nOh, and the stock market, which has performed well since Trump was elected, did lousy. Investors are afraid.\n\nOf course, the pushback Trump got from business came because of his response to the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.\n\nIt was that kind of week. It's understandable if you lost track. Here's how it all went down.\n\nMonday, August 14\n\n--8 a.m. ET: Merck CEO Ken Frazier, one of very few black Fortune 500 CEOs, takes the first step. He steps down from President Trump's manufacturing council, saying \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\"\n\n--On Tuesday afternoon, Trump gives a news conference inside Trump Tower.

Thank you all!\"\n\n--1:20 p.m.: United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes puts out a statement, explaining his exit from the manufacturing council.\n\n--1:30 p.m.: Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, releases a statement about why he resigned.\n\n--2 p.m.: General Electric's Jeff Immelt issues a statement on his decision to leave the council.\n\n--4:30 p.m.: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes a post condemning hate groups but doesn't mention Trump by name.\n\n--Late Wednesday night, Apple CEO Tim Cook sends a letter to employees, rejecting Trump's remarks on Charlottesville.\n\nThursday, August 17\n\n--1:15 p.m.: Cleveland Clinic, a hospital system, backs out of plans to host a fundraiser at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. It doesn't give a reason for the decision.\n\n--4 p.m.: American Cancer Society becomes the second organization to cancel plans for an event at Mar-a-Lago. The charity says using Trump property presented a \"challenge\" to its \"values.\"\n\n--7:30 p.m.: Another organization, American Friends of Magen David Adom, pulls a fundraising event from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--Throughout the day, three top magazines -- Time, The Economist and the New Yorker -- post snapshots of their latest magazine covers. Each lampooned Trump's response to Charlottesville.\n\n--Late Thursday, a scathing letter criticizing Trump written by 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, is made public. He is the son of Trump confidante Rupert Murdoch.\n\n-- Late Thursday, a leader of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, of which President Trump's Florida resort Mar-a-Lagowants, says all charities should do a moral gut check before doing business at the club.\n\nFriday, August 18\n\n--12:30 p.m.: The American Red Cross cancels plans to hold its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--1 p.m.: The Salvation Army says it won't host its holiday gala at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--1:30 p.m.: Susan G. Komen, a breast cancer organization, pulls event from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--2 p.m.: The head of Leaders in Furthering Education, another philanthropic group, urges the foundation's board to move its fundraiser from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--3:40 p.m.: Two authors of Letter to Steve Mnuchin, signed by more than 340 members of the '85 Yale Graduating class, appear on CNN to discuss their argument that classmate and Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin should resign.\n\n-- 4 p.m.: Billionaire Carl Icahn, a longtime friend of Trump, posts a letter announcing he would no longer serve as a special adviser to the president.

Company spokeswoman Eileen Sheil told The Post on Thursday that \"there were a variety of factors\" behind the cancellation, but she added, \"We're not elaborating.\"\n\nShortly after, the American Cancer Society, another long-time charity customer of the club, said it would pull its own event and explore \"other opportunities and potential venues.\"\n\n\"Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,\" the group said in a statement. \"It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nBoth health-related groups faced growing pressure to rethink their support of the president's business amid numerous controversies. But the cancellations don't come without risk: The Cleveland Clinic said it had raised about $1 million a year for medical equipment over the last eight years at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMar-a-Lago's 2017-2018 season now looks like it will be the slowest period for charity events in at least a decade, according to a Washington Post analysis of upcoming events. It's unclear how much the cancellations could cost the club, though similar-sized events brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000.\n\nTrump's comments also appear to have helped turn the Palm Beach business community against one of its most opulent venues.\n\nBaker, head of the Palm Beach chamber, spoke vigorously against Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, saying that her directive to nearby charities was, \"If you're looking at your mission statement, can you honestly say having an event at Mar-a-Lago, given all that has transpired, is the best stewardship of your efforts?\"\n\n\"The club is a member of the chamber. But right is right,\" she added in an interview with The Post. \"My mantra this week is from Dante: 'The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.' Especially for nonprofits. Especially for groups who help people who can't help themselves.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's cancellation was an abrupt change, and the hospital system had still intended to host its ninth gala there as recently as last week. The move followed weeks of public turmoil, including a letter signed by 1,600 health professionals and others last month that said the Mar-a-Lago booking \"symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to healthcare.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's chief executive, Toby Cosgrove, was among the business leaders on the president's Strategic and Policy Forum that agreed to disband on Wednesday. As members of the group resigned, Trump said on Twitter that he would end the forum and a separate American Manufacturing Council \"rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic was ranked the nation's second-best hospital this month by U.S. News & World Report, which gave top honors to its urology, cardiology and heart surgery units.\n\nNearly 550 people visited the hospital's February fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, where the theme was \"Reflections of Versailles.\"\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Trump said at a press conference that \"both sides\" were to blame at the rally.\n\nThe American Cancer Society announced in a statement Thursday that it would no longer hold its upcoming fundraising gala in Trump's gilded ballroom. In a statement, the ACA said, in part:\n\n\"When we chose to hold our 2018 event and related dinner at Mar-a-Lago, we selected the venue based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements.\n\nOur values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.\"\n\nThe ACA has not yet chosen a new venue: \"With our volunteer leaders, we are exploring other opportunities and potential venues. The generous support of community volunteers and donors are critical to our life-saving mission. Only by coming together will we solve our society's most difficult challenges, including reducing the pain and suffering from cancer.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, a prominent academic medical center based in Ohio, has also announced that it would no longer have its upcoming fundraiser at the resort but did not elaborate on the decision. However, it was still scheduled to host attendees at Mar-a-Lago as recently as last week, according to the Post.\n\nLater on the same day, a spokesperson for the American Friends of Magen David Adom, an organization that works to raise funds for an ambulance service in Israel, said their annual gala would not be held at Mar-a-Lago this year. The association has held its fundraising formals there since 2012.\n\nTRUMP IN TEXAS: Trump to headline Dallas GOP fundraiser\n\nThe palatial waterfront property, which Trump has referred to as the \"winter White House,\" has been receiving cancellations for upcoming 2017 and 2018 events since earlier this year.\n\nThe Dana-Farber Cancer Institute told the Palm Beach Daily News that it would move its fundraiser to The Breakers, another waterfront resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Members of the organization and its hosting committee claim the decision was not politically motivated.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons to pick a venue: it's convenient, it feels relevant, there are high-net-worth individuals or potential donors are associated with that particular venue, it accommodates the number of guests that you are going to host, it's beautiful,\" Greg Propper, co-president of social impact agency Propper Daley, told Town & Country magazine, adding that \"the venue should do no harm.\"\n\nUNHEALTHY CODES: Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago kitchen had more than a dozen health code violations\n\nThe Palm Beach Daily News also reports that MorseLife moved its event, scheduled for Dec. 8, to The Breakers. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society is also moving its Jan. 27, 2018 to The Breakers.

The foundation was a new customer for Trump's club, and a potentially lucrative one: It spent $244,000 on rent and food on a previous gala at another site, according to tax filings.\n\nBut on Saturday, the foundation said it would find another venue.\n\n\"Given the current environment surrounding Mar-a-Lago, we have made the decision to move our annual dinner dance,\" Amanda Skier, the foundation's executive director, said in a written statement. She did not say which new venue the foundation would use.\n\nThat decision meant that Trump's club had lost nine of the 16 galas or dinner events that it had been scheduled to host during next winter's social \"season\" in Palm Beach. At least two other groups have also canceled charity luncheons there this week.\n\nThose losses could reduce the club's revenue by hundreds of thousands of dollars by each event, and deny President Trump his dual role as president and host to the island's partying elite. If he returns to the club for weekends next winter, the president could often find its grand ballrooms quiet and empty.\n\nThese cancellations all followed the president's remarks on the march of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which the president said the protesters, who gathered under the pretense of wanting to preserve a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, included some \"fine people.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross and Susan G. Komen joined the growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the club.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need - regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions - and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nTrump's club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past.\n\nBut the cancellations also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe Trump Organization has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe charitable groups join three other large event cancellations from Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nSome of the club's most notable local boosters, with long fundraising histories and deep Palm Beach roots, were also in outright rebellion Friday against the club. Lois Pope, a Mar-a-Lago member and philanthropist who heads the Lois Pope Life Foundation and Leaders In Furthering Education, said she had told her foundation's board to move its well-known December gala from the club.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and White Supremacists are repugnant and repulsive,\" Pope wrote in a statement. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nOne of the cancellations cut close to home for the Trumps. Big Dog Ranch Rescue said Friday it would no longer hold an upcoming event at the club and would instead move it to the group's facility nearby. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was scheduled to co-chair the event.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is not planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto told The Post on Friday. The local group has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008.\n\nThe Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation on Friday also announced it had canceled its annual medical briefing luncheon at the club and will move it to another venue.\n\n\"We stand with the community,\" the foundation's co-founder, Dusty Sang, told The Post Friday. \"I think people are standing up for what they believe.\"\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counterprotesters equally shared the blame for a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20",

His friend Carl Icahn, one of Trump's earliest supporters from Wall Street, said he will no longer serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues.\n\nEven a member of the Palm Beach chamber of commerce, which counts Trump's Mar-a-Lago club as a member, called on charities to consult their mission statements before deciding to do business with Trump.\n\nOh, and the stock market, which has performed well since Trump was elected, did lousy.

The American Cancer Society, which has held galas at the club since at least 2009, cited its \"values and commitment to diversity,\" The Washington Post reports, while the Cleveland Clinic told the Post \"there were a variety of factors\" behind its decision, adding, \"We're not elaborating.\" Similarly, AFMDA said it canceled its 2018 charity ball -- one of the biggest events at Mar-a-Lago last season -- \"after careful deliberation.\"\n\nThese cancelations, after Trump appeared to defend white supremacists, will certainly affect Mar-a-Lago's bottom line, the Post reports, noting that similar events brought in fees ranging from $100,000 to $275,000 apiece. The executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, Laurel Baker, said she \"can't help but think there will be more fallout\" for Trump's \"morally reprehensible\" club, which is a member of her organization. \"The glitter, the shine has gone from the club,\" she said, adding: \"The club is a member of the chamber. But right is right.\" There are still 13 big-ticket galas scheduled for Mar-a-Lago, notes the Post's David Fahrenthold, but at least seven major charities that typically hold events at Mar-a-Lago decided in recent months to look elsewhere, avoiding the need to cancel their galas.

His advisory councils collapsed. Some of his customers said they won't give him their business anymore.\n\nTrump's Treasury secretary got called out by his fellow Yale Class of '85 graduates. His friend Carl Icahn, one of Trump's earliest supporters from Wall Street, said he will no longer serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues.\n\nEven a member of the Palm Beach chamber of commerce, which counts Trump's Mar-a-Lago club as a member, called on charities to consult their mission statements before deciding to do business with Trump.\n\nOh, and the stock market, which has performed well since Trump was elected, did lousy. Investors are afraid.\n\nOf course, the pushback Trump got from business came because of his response to the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.\n\nIt was that kind of week. It's understandable if you lost track. Here's how it all went down.\n\nMonday, August 14\n\n--8 a.m. ET: Merck CEO Ken Frazier, one of very few black Fortune 500 CEOs, takes the first step. He steps down from President Trump's manufacturing council, saying \"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.\"\n\n--8:54 a.m.: Trump tweets that Frazier will now \"have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\n--1 p.m.: The president delivers a speech in which he calls the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists 'repugnant.'\n\n--8:14 p.m.: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank resigns from the manufacturing council.\n\n--11:37 a.m.: Scott Paul, president of Alliance for American Manufacturing, resigns from the Trump council.\n\n--On Tuesday afternoon, Trump gives a news conference inside Trump Tower. He reiterates his earlier position that he believes \"there is blame on both sides\" of last weekend's violence on the University of Virginia campus.\n\n--5:45 p.m.: Richard Trumka, president of the labor group AFL-CIO, and Thea Lee, economist at the AFL-CIO, resign from the manufacturing council.\n\n--Late Wednesday morning, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, the head of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, reportedly held a conference call with the members, who came to a collective decision to dissolve and started drafting a public statement.\n\n--1:14 p.m.: Trump tweets, announcing he was dissolving both the manufacturing council and economic advisory council: \"Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!\"\n\n--1:20 p.m.: United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes puts out a statement, explaining his exit from the manufacturing council.\n\n--1:30 p.m.: Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, releases a statement about why he resigned.\n\n--2 p.m.: General Electric's Jeff Immelt issues a statement on his decision to leave the council.\n\n--4:30 p.m.: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes a post condemning hate groups but doesn't mention Trump by name.\n\n--Late Wednesday night, Apple CEO Tim Cook sends a letter to employees, rejecting Trump's remarks on Charlottesville.\n\nThursday, August 17\n\n--1:15 p.m.: Cleveland Clinic, a hospital system, backs out of plans to host a fundraiser at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. It doesn't give a reason for the decision.\n\n--4 p.m.: American Cancer Society becomes the second organization to cancel plans for an event at Mar-a-Lago. The charity says using Trump property presented a \"challenge\" to its \"values.\"\n\n--7:30 p.m.: Another organization, American Friends of Magen David Adom, pulls a fundraising event from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--Throughout the day, three top magazines -- Time, The Economist and the New Yorker -- post snapshots of their latest magazine covers. Each lampooned Trump's response to Charlottesville.\n\n--Late Thursday, a scathing letter criticizing Trump written by 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, is made public. He is the son of Trump confidante Rupert Murdoch.\n\n-- Late Thursday, a leader of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, of which President Trump's Florida resort Mar-a-Lagowants, says all charities should do a moral gut check before doing business at the club.\n\nFriday, August 18\n\n--12:30 p.m.: The American Red Cross cancels plans to hold its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--1 p.m.: The Salvation Army says it won't host its holiday gala at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--1:30 p.m.: Susan G. Komen, a breast cancer organization, pulls event from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--2 p.m.: The head of Leaders in Furthering Education, another philanthropic group, urges the foundation's board to move its fundraiser from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n--3:40 p.m.: Two authors of Letter to Steve Mnuchin, signed by more than 340 members of the '85 Yale Graduating class, appear on CNN to discuss their argument that classmate and Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin should resign.\n\n-- 4 p.m.: Billionaire Carl Icahn, a longtime friend of Trump, posts a letter announcing he would no longer serve as a special adviser to the president. He said he wanted to avoid becoming a partisan distraction.\n\n-- CNNMoney's Olivia Chang, Jill Disis, Julia Horowitz and Shen Lu contributed to this report.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Komen on Friday joined a growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, deepening the financial impact to President Donald Trump's private business amid furor over his comments on Charlottesville.\n\nThe major exits now mean seven of the club's biggest event customers have abandoned it this week, likely costing the Trump business hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue or more.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast-cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need - regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions - and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe charitable groups joined three other large event cancellations Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is no longer planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto told The Post Friday.\n\nThe move from the local group, which has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008, suggests that pressure on the club is growing even among groups with deep roots in Palm Beach.\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe cancellations hit at one of the private Florida club's top moneymakers: The club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past during Palm Beach's glitzy social seasons.\n\nBut they also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counterprotesters were similarly at blame during a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Charities and other organizations have started backing out of plans to host events at the Trump-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nA chamber of commerce works to promote its members' interests, but Baker says that it's her duty to take a stand when she feels the values of her community are under attack.\n\n\"We're looking for integrity, we're looking for honesty,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking with CNNMoney on Friday, Baker said the bulk of the reaction she received has been \"very positive.\"\n\nMar-a-Lago declined to comment on Baker's statements. It referred questions to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe said she recognizes her comments run counter to some people's line of thinking: That business and politics don't mix. Baker contends the two \"just can't be separated\" -- particularly in light of this week's events.\n\nAnd some of the biggest names in the private sector haven't shied away from politics either.\n\nProminent business leaders began fleeing from Trump's business advisory councils this week in protest to his response to the white supremacist rally. Trump disbanded two councils amid the outflux.\n\nIn their words: Why charities are walking away from Trump\n\nThough Trump no longer has day-to-day involvement in Mar-a-Lago, which is controlled by the Trump Organization, his sons continue to operate the family business. And, as ethics experts have pointed out, the president stands to eventually reap the benefits of any profits made by those properties.\n\nBased on Trump's latest financial disclosure form from June, Mar-a-Lago has done well for him in the past.

Fahrenthold / The Washington Post\n\nThe Salvation Army, the American Red Cross and Susan G. Komen on Friday joined a growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, deepening the financial impact to President Donald Trump's private business amid furor over his comments on Charlottesville.\n\nThe major exits now mean seven of the club's biggest event customers have abandoned it this week, likely costing the Trump business hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue or more.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast-cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need - regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions - and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nThe charitable groups joined three other large event cancellations Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is no longer planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto told The Post Friday.\n\nThe move from the local group, which has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008, suggests that pressure on the club is growing even among groups with deep roots in Palm Beach.\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe cancellations hit at one of the private Florida club's top moneymakers: The club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past during Palm Beach's glitzy social seasons.\n\nBut they also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined

They said Trump's recent comments on last weekend's violence in Virginia by neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan supporters were inappropriate and didn't represent the values for which they and their organizations stood.\n\nCorporate leaders say Trump has gone too far now\n\nA 32-year-old Charlottesville woman was killed Saturday when a Maumee, Ohio man with reported Nazi sympathies allegedly plowed his car into a crowded street in the Virginia university town. This occurred during clashes involving white supremacists, shouting racist and antisemitic slurs and holding signs with symbols representing bigotry and hate. They were in Charlottesville to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate leader Robert E. Lee.\n\nAlthough Trump read a statement Monday denouncing bigotry, racism and antisemitism, he told reporters Tuesday there was \"bame on both sides\" because counter-protesters, some with clubs, were intent on creating conflict. He also said there were \"some very fine people on both sides\" who just wanted to present their respective views in the controversy over keeping or removing statues of Confederate War heroes.\n\nAnd he warned -- and repeated on Twitter today -- that the movement to remove Confederate War these statues could spread to a drive to take down statues of founding fathers and early presidents, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, because they were slave owners, too.\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nCorporate leaders, numerous members of Congress and many Americans say Trump is showing a gross and inappropriate sense of moral equivalency.\n\nThe Nazis, who killed 6 million Jews in World War II, and Ku Klux Klan, who lynched black Americans throughout the South and whose members still want to maintain racial segregation, embodied evil, and no thoughtful American should stand with them or equivocate about \"both sides,\" the Trump critics say.\n\nThe criticism has built throughout the week, creating public anxiety about the Trump's judgment barely seven months into his presidency. Some of his supporters, however, say he has been misunderstood or was merely inartful in presenting his understanding of the Charlottesville events. White separatist and nationalist leaders have gone further and praised Trump, with former KKK leader David Duke thanking Trump for his \"honesty and courage.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic system, which has a hospital in Broward County, Florida, was under public pressure to move its February fund-raiser long before this week. The Mar-a-Lago controversy erupted soon after Trump took office in January and signed an executive order to temporarily ban people from Syria and other Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nThis affected medical students and young doctors doing residencies at American hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic. A petition drive and peaceful protests in Cleveland would not dissuade the Clinic because, officials there said, it had a binding contract with Trump's club for the 2017 event. That event wound up raising about $1 million for the Clinic's Florida hospital.\n\nThe Clinic then said it would consider moving its annual Florida gala to another location in 2018, but later said it decided to continue using the Trump Club because a committee that included donors preferred Mar-a-lago to any alternatives. The hospital stood out in this regard, since several other charitable and medical organizations that have hosted events there had decided to go elsewhere in 2018.\n\nTrump's strong support for dismantling the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, appeared to factor into those decisions. Trump says the nation will be better off it Obamacare \"implodes,\" citing high premiums for Americans whose incomes are too high to qualify for subsidies.\n\nLeading medical organizations and the nonpartisan Congressional Bydget Office say the Republican replacement proposals would leave at least 22 million Americans without health coverage.\n\nWith that specific criticism, a group of medical students, heath professionals and liberal interest groups launched a fresh petition drive last week to try to persuade the Clinic to abandon Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Clinic said last week, however, that it planned to sign a contract with Mar-a-Lago for 2018.\n\nA new attempt to dissuade the Cleveland Clinic\n\nWith the newest Trump controversy swirling, it has changed its mind.", "dateTime":

The letter featured an acrostic which spelt out \"resist\". The members were appointed by Barack Obama.\n\nAnd one of the three universities to give Trump an honorary doctorate is considering whether to revoke it.\n\nMitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, warned of an \"unraveling of our national fabric\" in a Facebook post attacking Trump over his defence of people involved in a neo-Nazi rally.\n\n\"Whether he intended to or not,

The group did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\nThe new announcements bring the total number of groups that have canceled events at Mar-a-Lago to seven.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society and the American Friends of Magen David Adom all announced that would no longer hold events at the club earlier this week.\n\nTrump has faced mounting criticism following an off-the-rails news conference on Tuesday when he appeared to defend white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups who had gathered in Charlottesville, Va., to protest the removal of a Confederate statue.\n\nHe also doubled down on his claim that \"both sides\" were responsible for the violence that erupted during the Saturday protests, criticizing what he called \"alt-left\" demonstrators for violently confronting white nationalist groups.\n\nThe president's comments spurred immediate criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who have urged him in recent days to take a harder line against racism and hate groups.\n\nAlso amid the fallout, two of Trump's economic councils disbanded as prominent business leaders sought to distance themselves from a White House consumed increasingly by controversy.

Komen on Friday joined a growing exodus of organizations canceling plans to hold fundraising events at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, deepening the financial impact to President Trump's private business amid furor over his comments on Charlottesville.\n\nThe major exits now mean seven of the club's biggest event customers have abandoned it in a matter of hours, likely costing the Trump business hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue or more.\n\nThe Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement Friday.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the nation's largest breast-cancer fundraising group, said Friday it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nAnd the Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is no longer planning on hosting an event at the club, president Richard Busto told The Post Friday. The group has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at the club every year since at least 2008.\n\n[Three fundraising giants cancel plans for galas at Mar-a-Lago]\n\nThe charitable groups joined three other large event cancellations Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nAnother group, the Unicorn Children's Foundation, said it is \"currently exploring other options\" for a previously planned luncheon at Mar-a-Lago and would make its final decision next month.\n\nThe cancellations hit at one of the private Florida club's top moneymakers: The club earned between $100,000 and $275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past during Palm Beach's glitzy social seasons.\n\nBut they also reveal a widening vulnerability for Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counter-protesters were similarly at blame during a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:13:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "17:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "181655", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "200134", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302511", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "score": 4}, {"id": "302736", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "score": 3}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 4}, {"id": "303051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "score": 1}, {"id": "304262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "score": 4}, {"id": "306226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "score": 3}, {"id": "308497", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "score": 3}, {"id": "312981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "score": 3}, {"id": "313741", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fundraising"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundraising", "score": 5}, {"id": "315119", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "319128", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "score": 2}, {"id": "319689", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Susan G.

Many Jewish residents of Palm Beach County have family members who perished in the Holocaust.\n\n\"When you get into the area of anti-Semitism, global anti-Semitism, it transcends all the other issues, like health care and immigration,\" the philanthropist said. \"The issue is so raw now, I think you will see people bail.\"\n\nIndeed, a prominent organization that provides money for disaster relief in Israel became the third charity on Thursday to cancel a planned fundraising gala at Mar-a-Lago since Trump's comments on Charlottesville.\n\n\" Palm Beach chamber head tells charities 'have a conscience' about Mar-a-Lago events\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom issued a terse statement to the Palm Beach Post Thursday evening, announcing the cancellation of its gala, set for Sunday, Feb. 25, 2018.\n\nLast season's gala, held Feb. 26, featured more than 600 attendees who paid $650 per ticket for the event.\n\n\"After considerable deliberation, AFMDA -- an apolitical and humanitarian aid organization -- will not hold its 2018 Palm Beach Celebration of Life Gala at Mar-a-Lago.\" Magen David Adom (MDA) is Israel's ambulance, blood services and disaster-relief organization, serving as emergency medical first-responders.\n\n\" RELATED: Why the American Humane Association won't return to Mar-a-Lago\n\nNo further information was available about whether AFMDA would try to hold an event elsewhere in Palm Beach County during the season.\n\nRichard Rampell, a Palm Beach CPA, said the issue of philanthropy is very important to those of the Jewish faith.\n\nThe Hebrew word, \"tzedakah,\" often is used to describe charity. But the word means much more, Rampell said.\n\n\"It means righteousness and justice,\" he said. \"Giving is not viewed as a generous or magnanimous act, but as an obligation.\"\n\nNowhere is this belief more evident on Palm Beach than at the Palm Beach Country Club, created by the Jewish community after members were excluded from other clubs on the island.\n\nRampell said he is not a member of the Palm Beach Country Club, but he has friends and clients who are. Membership is not even considered unless an applicant can demonstrate years of generous philanthropy, Rampell said.\n\n\" RELATED: Dana Farber, three other charities won't return to Mar-a-Lago in 2018\n\nPalm Beach Country Club members are among the most generous contributors to cultural, medical and other organizations, Rampell said.\n\nAnd Palm Beach overall has become a center of philanthropy for many national organizations during the winter season.\n\nFor a number of organizations, a Palm Beach gala is the single-largest fundraiser they hold. But hosting these elegant affairs costs big money, especially at the two premier Palm Beach locations, The Breakers Hotel and Trump's Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTherefore, charities canceling at Mar-a-Lago are sending a loud message to Trump, Rampell said.\n\n\"Money is something that Trump understands, more than anything,\" Rampell said.\n\nRampell said the same dynamic is starting to play out at Mar-a-Lago as was seen recently with Trump's manufacturing council, where Merck's chief executive quit, followed by several other top executives.\n\nWhen one charity decides to cancel an event at a Trump property, others are emboldened, Rampell said.\n\n\"Everyone is afraid to make the first move. You need a leader with a lot of stature,\" Rampell said, noting that Cleveland Clinic has a lot of stature.\n\nWhen other organizations see a leader act, \"other people will follow,\" Rampell said.\n\nIndeed, hours after Cleveland Clinic announced it would not hold its charity event at Mar-a-Lago, the American Cancer Society also announced it would not have its gala there.\n\nRampell said he expects other charities will follow.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T22:37:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1943, "textStart": 1930, "date": "2018-02-25", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1978, "textStart": 1971, "date": "-02-26", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442", "time": "22:37:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3369442", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "102", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "182175", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "182176", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302942", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "score": 5}, {"id": "304554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "score": 5}, {"id": "305262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "score": 4}, {"id": "310713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "score": 4}, {"id": "312441", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Holocaust"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust", "score": 3}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 5}, {"id": "314994", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "score": 2}, {"id": "315059", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "score": 2}, {"id": "354028", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tzedakah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah", "score": 2}, {"id": "395198", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Magen David Adom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom", "score": 3}, {"id": "849200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Breakers (hotel)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakers_(hotel)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/rf/image_large/Pub/p8/MyPalmBeachPost/2017/08/18/Images/newsEngin.19605169_100506-met-trump1of2.jpg.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:44:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Inside philanthropists' decision to quit Trump, Mar-a-Lago", "originalArticle": null}

Charlottesville.\n\nTrump has faced mounting criticism following a news conference on Tuesday, where he appeared to defend white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups that had gathered in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a Confederate statue.\n\nHe also doubled down on his claim that \"both sides\" were responsible for the violence that erupted during the Saturday protests -- resulting in the death of one counterprotester and the injury of at least a dozen others when a man with alleged racist connections plowed his car into a crowd -- criticizing what he called \"alt-left\" demonstrators

Komen joined the growing exodus of organisations cancelling plans to hold fundraising events at the club.\n\nSusan G. Komen, the US's largest breast cancer fundraising group, said it would seek another venue after hosting its \"Perfect Pink Party\" gala at Mar-a-Lago every year since 2011.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has held a gala at the club every year since 2014, said in a statement that it would not hold its event there \"because the conversation has shifted away\" from its mission of helping those in need.\n\nAnd the American Red Cross said it would cancel its annual fundraiser at the club because \"it has increasingly become a source of controversy and pain for many of our volunteers, employees and supporters,\" the charity said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to staff Friday, chief executive Gail McGovern said, \"The Red Cross provides assistance without discrimination to all people in need - regardless of nationality, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or political opinions - and we must be clear and unequivocal in our defense of that principle.\"\n\nTrump's club earned between $US100,000 and $US275,000 each from similar-sized events in the past.\n\nBut the cancellations also reveal a widening vulnerability for Mr Trump, who, unlike past presidents, refused to divest from his business interests when he joined the White House.\n\nThe Trump Organisation has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe charitable groups join three other large event cancellations from Thursday: the Cleveland Clinic, the American Friends of Magen David Adom and the American Cancer Society, which cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in its decision to abandon the club.\n\nSome of the club's most notable local boosters, with long fundraising histories and deep Palm Beach roots, were also in outright rebellion Friday against the club. Lois Pope, a Mar-a-Lago member and philanthropist who heads the Lois Pope Life Foundation and Leaders In Furthering Education, said she had told her foundation's board to move its well-known December gala from the club.\n\n\"The hatred, vitriol and anti-Semitic and racist views being spewed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists are repugnant and repulsive,\" Pope wrote in a statement. \"And anyone who would demonstrate even a modicum of support for them by insisting that there are 'good people' among them is not deserving of my personal patronage or that of my foundations.\"\n\nOne of the cancellations cut close to home for the Trumps. Big Dog Ranch Rescue said Friday it would no longer hold an upcoming event at the club and would instead move it to the group's facility nearby. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was scheduled to co-chair the event.\n\nThe Autism Project of Palm Beach County also said Friday that it is not planning on hosting an event at the club, President Richard Busto told The Post on Friday. The local group has held \"Renaissance Dinner\" galas at Mar-a-Lago every year since at least 2008.\n\nThe Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation on Friday also announced it had cancelled its annual medical briefing luncheon at the club and will move it to another venue.\n\nThe groups' cancellations follow rebukes from business executives this week, who heavily criticized Trump's comments that white supremacists and counterprotesters equally shared the blame for a deadly weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Washington Post", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:57:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

The cancellations signal \"a direct blowback\" to the president's business empire as a result of the uproar, The Post says.\n\nFrom the story:\n\nThe American Cancer Society, a high-dollar client at the club since at least 2009, cited its \"values and commitment to diversity\" in a statement on its decision to move an upcoming fundraising gala. Another longtime Mar-a-Lago customer, the Cleveland Clinic, abruptly changed course on its winter event only days after saying it planned to continue doing business at Mar-a-Lago, a leading venue for charitable events in the posh resort town.\n\nThe American Friends of Magen David Adom, which raises money for Israel's equivalent of the Red Cross, also said it would not hold its 2018 gala at the club \"after considerable deliberation,\" though it did not give a reason. The charity had one of Mar-a-Lago's biggest events last season, with about 600 people in attendance.\n\nThe cancellations \"will undoubtedly squeeze revenue\" for the private club, the newspaper reports. It estimates similar-size events \"have often brought in fees of between $100,000 and $275,000 each.\"\n\nAnd things might get worse for Mar-a-Lago. The Post reports that the head of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, of which Mar-a-Lago is a member, called the business \"morally reprehensible\" and said she expected more charities to defect.\n\nA fun New York Times story looks at what it takes to market Frank Lloyd Wright houses that are for sale nationwide, including one in Willoughby Hills.\n\nAmong the unique challenges are \"the need to become a Wright expert, to devise a strategy for separating potential buyers from sightseers, and to develop a convincing argument for why someone should pay a premium to live in a house with small bedrooms and a snug kitchen, cinder-block walls, cement floors, narrow doorways, a carport instead of a garage and, quite likely, no air-conditioning,\" the paper notes.\n\nAnd for potential buyers, The Times says, \"it means becoming the steward of a legacy, which includes instant membership in an exclusive, sometimes intrusive, society of Wright enthusiasts.\n\nIn Willoughby Hills, the Penfield House, built in 1955, has just been listed for sale with Howard Hanna Real Estate for $1.3 million. It had been put on the market for $1.7 million about three years ago.\n\nThe Times talks with Paul Penfield, who \"remembers Wright's long silver hair and the coat he wore draped over his shoulders when he met with his parents in 1957 to discuss designing his second house for them.\"\n\n\"My wife, Donna, and I are getting ready to retire, and my children have busy careers of their own and they don't want to manage the property,\" Penfield, 72, tells the newspaper.\n\nThe Times says Penfield \"was drawn back to Penfield House in 1983 after his mother died and he inherited the property. He undertook a five-year restoration project that was completed in 2004, at which time the Penfields, who live in another midcentury modern house nearby, began renting out the three-bedroom house for $275 to $300 a night. The 1,730-square-foot house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is booked through early November.\"\n\nEven in senior slow-pitch softball leagues, apparently, there are people who will look to get an unfair advantage.\n\nThere's a bizarre Cleveland anecdote in this Wall Street Journal feature about the popularity of senior softball, which is played by an estimated 393,000 Americans in their 50s and above, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. And their ranks are rising as people age; The Journal notes there were 13.9 million men age 70 or over in the United States in 2016, up 17% from 2011.\n\nIt's mostly fun and games, though as the newspaper points out, \"there's the matter of making sure everyone is a genuine senior.\"\n\nFrom the story:\n\nIn the Cleveland suburbs, the Huff-N-Puffers league last year discovered at the end of the season that its champion team had surreptitiously fielded two players a year or two below the league's 60-year-old threshold. All team members were stripped of their championship jackets, and the league now requires a photo ID to prove age.\n\nJohn Teron, league president, said nothing like that had happened in more than three decades of play: \"Why would you want to join the senior league if you're not senior?\"\n\nFord has a new store on Madison Avenue and 61st Street in Manhattan. As you would expect, it is very fancy and is filled with beautiful items. His wares \"have long charmed the rich and famous,\" The Times says, and the paper somehow settles on Jones as an example of that.\n\nHe and his pregnant wife, Valeisha, \"were being squired around by a black-clad attendant offering assistance,\" the paper says. \"Up the spiral staircase, a glossy corkscrew of black fiberglass, is the men's department, where the real action is. Mr. Ford is known for red-carpet women's wear (those sequined dresses are major sellers), but his is the unusual luxury brand at which men's wear outsells women's. (Mr. and Mrs. Jones had soon repaired upward to assess men's backpacks and leather goods.)\"\n\nThe story, written by Times style reporter Matthew Schneier, ends this way: \"I did not have the means or the wherewithal to lay down my Amex. But for a few minutes, I was a Ford man, peer of the rich and fabulous, literally keeping up with the Joneses. Dress for the job you want, the saying goes. May I introduce you to me, the newest Cleveland Cavalier?\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:01:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 230, "textStart": 223, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb":

Wall Street, and polite society, is spooked.\n\nFor many critics of Donald Trump, there were two best-case scenarios for his presidency. The first was that he might induce the unlikely political realignment that his populist campaign seemed to promise: a European-style fusion of nationalism with staunch support for the welfare state. In this scenario, Trump would build the wall and renegotiate tougher trade deals, but he would also protect Medicaid and work with Democrats to pour money into infrastructure projects around the country. At its core was the premise that Trump is not an ideologue and might be uniquely positioned to positively disrupt an ossified political establishment.\n\nThis, it quickly became obvious, would not happen. Instead, Trump quickly adopted a traditional Republican platform focused on tax cuts and deregulation. Which leads to the second best-case scenario: that Trump, a political neophyte motivated by glad-handing and deal-making, might be uniquely positioned to help implement a center-right, pro-business agenda. And indeed, his presidency seemed to start off this way. The stock market soared as Trump made peace with Paul Ryan, set about unshackling Wall Street, and assembled several business advisory councils, convening the nation's top C.E.O.s for photo-ops and brainstorming best practices for cutting America's red tape. The presence of so many millionaires and billionaires in his Cabinet may have seemed gaudy, even unseemly, but at least it suggested that Trump wouldn't succumb to his more apocalyptic impulses. Markets largely ignored the president's rumblings about trade wars with China or Mexico (or Canada or Germany), secured by the presence of Trump handlers like former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn.\n\nIn the last week, however, the wheels have come off the Trump train in spectacular fashion. The same executives who saw their proximity to the president as a net benefit to their shareholders abruptly changed their calculus when Trump drew a moral equivalency between the neo-Nazi white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend and the protesters who stood up to them. In a press conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday, the president returned to his first reaction to the violence, telling reporters \"I think there is blame on both sides.\" Cohn, among the other White House advisers who were assembled alongside him, having expected to discuss an infrastructure plan, looked distraught. Chief of staff John Kelly, who had recently joined the West Wing in hopes of bringing some military discipline to an unruly group, stared glumly at the floor.\n\nA groundswell of criticism and shock followed from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including former presidents, world leaders, and even members of Trump's own staff. By Wednesday, a dozen or so of the business leaders who had bolstered Trump's credibility in his first weeks in office, and were to serve as the lynchpin of his tax-reform campaign, decided to disband their advisory councils in protest. On Thursday, the White House said that it would scrap a third corporate advisory group -- the yet-to-be-fully-formed Council on Infrastructure -- which was only officially established last month. An incorrect tweet claiming that Cohn would be resigning caused the stock market rally to falter, with the benchmark index dropping half a point and Treasury yields falling 0.7 percent before recovering when the rumor was quickly debunked.\n\nThe brief stumble exposed how fragile the business community's faith in Trump has become. Since before the election, the bull case for the Trump presidency was that the real-estate mogul would surround himself with the same stabilizing, charity-circuit set that he mingled with back in New York. In the past week, however, Trump has become increasingly isolated, relying on an ever-smaller circle of loyalists as polite society has turned its back on him. On Tuesday, according to The Washington Post, three fund-raising pillars decided to pull out of events at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. The American Cancer society, which has held its annual event there for the past eight years, said its \"values and commitment to diversity\" led to its decision to hold the upcoming gala elsewhere. The American Friends of Magen David Adom, which is one of the club's biggest events with roughly 600 attendees, also said it would not to use Mar-a-Lago as the venue for its 2018 gala after \"considerable deliberation.\" The Cleveland Clinic, which had, as recently as this month, said it would host its ninth gala there, reversed course on Wednesday, after 1,600 health professionals said that booking the event there \"symbolically and financially supports a politician actively working to decrease access to health care,\" the Post reported. (The clinic's chief executive also happened to sit on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, one of the groups that disbanded this week.)\n\nEven before Trump's widely derided Charlottesville statements, seven other groups that had, in the past, hosted events at Mar-a-Lago had announced that they would be taking their business elsewhere. This amounts to the slowest stretch for charity events at the club in a decade, according to the Post. That will cost the Trump Organization a pretty penny, since each of the galas brings in between $100,000 to $275,000. The president opted to not divest from his global business empire when he took office, relinquishing day-to-day control to his two sons. The whole family retains a financial stake.\n\nBack in the Washington swamp, however, one Trump property isn't feeling a pinch. Trump's International Hotel in Washington, just five blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, has raised room rates and drink prices in order to keep pace with the overflowing demand for all-things Make America Great Again. On any given night, members of Trump's Cabinet and inner circle will gather in the lobby, and revelers hoping to get a taste of the action have ponied up $25 for cocktails and nearly $700 per night for rooms to drink it all in. And while foundations may be shying away from Mar-a-Lago, conservative organizations, and even a Supreme Court justice aren't pulling back from their D.C. haunt. Only two weeks before the court takes up Trump's travel ban case, Trump's appointee to the bench, Neil Gorsuch, is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the Fund for American Studies 50th anniversary event at the end of September.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4431372582912445, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369442",

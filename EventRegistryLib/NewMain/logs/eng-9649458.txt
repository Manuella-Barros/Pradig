Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the city of Yekaterinburg, authorities said Thursday June 13, 2024.\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, authorities said Thursday.\n\nAn indictment of the Wall Street Journal reporter has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) east of Moscow, according to Russia's Prosecutor General's office.\n\nGershkovich is accused of \"gathering secret information\" for the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.\n\nThe officials didn't provide any evidence to back up the accusations. There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He said any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the city of Yekaterinburg, authorities said Thursday [...]\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, authorities said Thursday.\n\nAn indictment of the Wall Street Journal reporter has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) east of Moscow, according to Russia's Prosecutor General's office.\n\nGershkovich is accused of \"gathering secret information\" on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.\n\nThe officials didn't provide any evidence to back up the accusations. There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPlant foreman Igor Kholmanskih appeared on Putin's annual phone-in program in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability,\" proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the capital to help suppress the unrest. A week later, Putin appointed Kholmanskikh to be his envoy in the region.\n\nPutin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He told international news agencies in St. Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gershkovich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evan Gershkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gershkovich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gershkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ural Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralvagonzavod", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uralvagonzavod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sverdlovsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sverdlovsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelimkhan_Khangoshvili", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zelimkhan Khangoshvili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_M._Tracy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynne M.

Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the city of Yekaterinburg, authorities said Thursday June 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, where he was detained, authorities said Thursday.\n\nAn indictment of The Wall Street Journal reporter has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) east of Moscow, according to Russia's Prosecutor General's office.\n\nGershkovich, 32, is accused of \"gathering secret information\" on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.\n\nThe officials did not provide any evidence to back up the accusations. There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time that he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" a statement by Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and publisher of the Journal, and Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor in chief, said.\n\nThey added that the charges against Gershkovich were \"false and baseless.\"\n\n\"The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement said. \"We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the U.S. government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nRoger Carstens, the Biden administration's special presidential envoy who serves as the U.S. government's top hostage negotiator, said that though he had been hopeful about striking a deal to get Gershkovich home before this point, the latest development \"doesn't slow or stop us down.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is, this was not unexpected,\" he said.\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPlant foreman Igor Kholmanskih appeared on Putin's annual phone-in program in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability,\" proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the Russian capital to help suppress the unrest. A week later, Putin appointed Kholmanskikh to be his envoy in the region.\n\nPutin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He told international news agencies in St. Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source":

There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the US government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on US orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the US is \u201ctaking energetic steps\u201d to secure his release. He said any such releases \u201caren\u2019t decided via mass media\u201d but through a \u201cdiscreet, calm and professional approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\u201d he added, in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first US journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich\u2019s arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet \u00e9migr\u00e9s who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin\u2019s purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nUS Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \u201cfiction\u201d and said that Russia is \u201cusing American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\u201d\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several US nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.\n\nAdditional

Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as

There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" according to a statement by Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and publisher of the Journal, and Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor in chief.\n\nThey added that the charges against Gershkovich were \"false and baseless.\"\n\n\"The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies.

There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" according to a statement by Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and publisher of the Journal, and Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor in chief.\n\nThey added that the charges against Gershkovich were \"false and baseless.\"\n\n\"The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement said. \"We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the U.S. government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPlant foreman Igor Kholmanskih appeared on Putin's annual phone-in program in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability,\" proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the capital to help suppress the unrest. A week later, Putin appointed Kholmanskikh to be his envoy in the region.\n\nPutin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He told international news agencies in St. Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source":

Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated Press\n\nMOSCOW -- U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, authorities said Thursday.\n\nAn indictment of the Wall Street Journal reporter and Bowdoin College grad has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city about 870 miles east of Moscow, according to Russia's Prosecutor General's office.\n\nGershkovich is accused of \"gathering secret information\" on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.\n\nRelated Read more on Bowdoin College graduate Evan Gershkovich\n\nThe officials didn't provide any evidence to back up the accusations. There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil about 60 miles north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPlant foreman Igor Kholmanskih appeared on Putin's annual phone-in program in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability,\" proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the capital to help suppress the unrest. A week later, Putin appointed Kholmanskikh to be his envoy in the region.\n\nPutin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He told international news agencies in St. Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the US government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe plant foreman appeared on Mr Putin's annual phone-in programme in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability\", proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the capital to help suppress the unrest.\n\nA week later, Mr Putin appointed the plant foreman to be his envoy in the region.\n\nMr Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov.\n\nHe was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Mr Putin said the US is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release.\n\nHe told international news agencies in St Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach\".\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first US journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War.\n\nGershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious tsarist-era prison used during Joseph Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nUS ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends\".\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several US nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"},

Gershkovich, The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government and Gershkovich's many colleagues all vehemently dispute he was working as a spy and say that he was doing his job as a reporter.\n\nGershkovich was on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg, the capital of the Sverdlovsk region, when he was arrested in March 2023.\n\nPreviously, prosecutors have alleged Gershkovich was working for a foreign intelligence service without specifying which one.\n\nMORE: Parents of reporter Evan Gershkovich speak out 1 year into his Russian detainment: Exclusive\n\nIn March, Gershkovich's parents had told ABC News they were optimistic about progress in their son's case.\n\n\"We know that the U.S. government is taking Evan's case very seriously,\" his mother, Ella Milman, told \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive sit-down interview.\n\n\"I think if you let the pessimism in ... the game is over,\" she said. \"And our saying in the family is we're moving forward. Moving forward.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin made his first comments on Gershkovich's detention in months on June 5.\n\n\"I know that the United States administration is really taking energetic steps for his release. This is true. But such issues are not resolved through the media,\" Putin said. \"They love such a quiet, calm professional approach and dialogue between the intelligence services.\"\n\nHe added, \"You know, you believe that he is innocent, and Russian law enforcement agencies and special services believe that he committed illegal actions, which are called espionage. I will not go into details.\"\n\nGershkovich most recently appeared in court in Moscow for a pretrial hearing on April 23 as part of an appeal against the spying charges. His appeal was denied and he was ordered held through at least June 30.\n\nThe reporter smiled and gave a thumb's up when asked by ABC News inside the courtroom how he was doing.\n\nABC News' Will Gretsky and Mark Osborne contributed to this report.\n\nWall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich to stand trial in Russia on espionage charges originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source":

An indictment of the Wall Street Journal reporter has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city about 870 miles east of Moscow, according to Russia's Prosecutor General's office.\n\nGershkovich is accused of \"gathering secret information\" for the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.\n\nThe officials didn't provide any evidence to back up the accusations. There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He said any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nHis sister Danielle told CBS News' Lesley Stahl in March that the siblings have always been close. She said she was shattered when she learned he had been taken into custody in Russia.\n\n\"I got a call from my mom,\" she told CBS News. \"It's just, my stomach fell out, you know? Your heart stops. It's so hard to believe that something like that is actually real. And I remember my mom and I discussing the morning after: 'Is that really Evan, that photo that came out?' We didn't want to admit for a moment that that was him.\"\n\nStahl asked, \"Did you think [detention] was a possibility? Russia a year ago had already become dangerous. Other news organizations were pulling reporters out.\"\n\n\"I would say my whole family was nervous,\" she replied, but added that her brother would always remind his family that he was an accredited journalist in Russia -- and, therefore, supposedly safe.\n\n\"It's very unprecedented,\" Danielle said of her brother's arrest.\n\nBut what was unprecedented has become almost routine under Putin. Marine veteran Paul Whelan has been jailed in Russia for five years; Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was arrested in January, accused of treason for helping Ukraine; and basketball star Brittney Griner, imprisoned for nine months on drug charges, was finally freed in an exchange for a notorious arms dealer known as the \"Merchant of Death.\"\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"},

There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nGershkovich, 32, is accused of \"gathering secret information\" on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged after arresting Gershkovich that he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but provided no evidence to back up the accusations.\n\nThe U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller slammed the development, saying there was \"absolutely zero credibility to those charges\" and adding that the U.S. government would continue to work to bring Gershkovich home.\n\n\"Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime,\" Miller said. \"The charges against him are false. And the Russian government knows that they're false. He should be released immediately.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" a statement by Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and publisher of the Journal, and Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor in chief, said.\n\nThey added that the charges against Gershkovich were \"false and baseless.\"\n\n\"The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement said. \"We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the U.S. government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nRoger Carstens, the Biden administration's special presidential envoy who serves as the U.S. government's top hostage negotiator, said that though he had been hopeful about striking a deal to get Gershkovich home before this point, the latest development \"doesn't slow or stop us down.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is, this was not unexpected,\" he said.\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil, about 100 kilometers north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPlant foreman Igor Kholmanskih appeared on Putin's annual phone-in program in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability,\" proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the Russian capital to help suppress the unrest. A week later, Putin appointed Kholmanskikh to be his envoy in the region.\n\nPutin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He told international news agencies in St. Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source":

There was no word on when the trial would begin.\n\nGershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He said any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com",

Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" said the paper's publisher, Almar Latour, and its editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, in a statement. \"The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime,\" they added.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also denounced the charges, with spokesman Matthew Miller telling reporters that Gershkovich \"should be released immediately.\"\n\n\"There is absolutely zero credibility to those charges,\" Miller said. \"We have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should have never been arrested in the first place.\"\n\nProsecutors did not say when the proceedings against Gershkovich would begin, but once they do, he faces the prospect of a trial behind closed doors given that Russian officials say the case involves classified information. If found guilty, he could serve as much as 20 years in prison.\n\nGershkovich is currently being held in pretrial detention at Lefortovo prison in Moscow, where according to the Journal he has been confined 23 hours a day to his cell, leaving only for meetings with his attorneys or U.S. embassy officials, and for occasional court appearances.\n\nWith his arrest last year, Gershkovich became the first American journalist to be detained by Russia on espionage charges since KGB operatives took the reporter Nicholas Daniloff into custody in 1986. At the time, the effort to free Daniloff meant having to navigate Cold War tensions between Washington and Moscow. Now, the effort to negotiate Gershkovich's freedom has been complicated by deepening friction between the U.S. and Russia in the aftermath Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGershkovich is not the only American currently being held in Russia. Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, is currently serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted of similar charges, and Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian American journalist with the U.S.-government funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty news service, is being detained on charges of failing to register as a \"foreign agent.\"\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. has agreed to several notable prisoner swaps with Russia. In 2022, the U.S. secured the release of the U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed in exchange for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for conspiring to import more than $100 million of cocaine into the country.\n\nLater that year, the U.S. released the convicted Russian arms-trafficker Viktor Boutin exchange for the WNBA star Brittney Griner. While families of detained Americans have cheered these exchanges, critics have said they incentivize Russia to take more Westerners prisoner in order to use as future bargaining chips.\n\nAddressing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, told House lawmakers the announcement by Russian prosecutors was not unexpected.\n\n\"I think we were all hopeful that we would be able to broker a deal with the Russians before this happened. But it doesn't stop or slow us down. We can keep continuing to pursue not only Evan's freedom, but also Paul Whelan's freedom as well,\" Carstens said in testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org",

Gershkovich, his employer and the U.S. government have all vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nAfter more than a year in pretrial detention, the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said Thursday that Gershkovich's case would be sent to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, in the city where he was arrested, for trial at an unspecified date.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said that Gershkovich's indictment on espionage charges had been finalized following an investigation by Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nIt said he had \"acted on instructions from the CIA\" and \"collected secret information\" about the manufacturer Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the region that produces and repairs military equipment. It added that \"illegal actions were carried out by Gershkovich in compliance with careful measures of secrecy.\"\n\nRussian authorities have presented no evidence to support their accusations, which were revealed for the first time in Thursday's statement.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nIn a joint statement, Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said \"we had hoped to avoid this moment.\"\n\n\"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge,\" it said. \"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job.\"\n\nGershkovich's arrest has been condemned by journalists and government officials across the West, who see it as emblematic of the war Putin has waged against freedom of speech both in Russia and abroad.\n\nThe U.S. has designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained, with Ambassador Lynne Tracy saying at a hearing in March that \"the accusations against Evan are categorically untrue.\"\n\nBut Putin has signaled he believes a deal could be struck to free Gershkovich.\n\nA possible exchange had been in the works that could have resulted in the release of Gershkovich, former Marine Paul Whelan, and Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, sources told NBC News in February.\n\nThe swap was not thought to be imminent when the death of Navalny in an Arctic penal colony was announced on Feb. 16., five sources told NBC News.\n\nGershkovich has been kept in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison, which is known for its harsh conditions. His multiple appeals have been rejected in court, and a previous announcement said that his pretrial detention had been extended until at least June 30.\n\nDuring these court appearances, Gershkovich often smiles and appears in good spirits. But his detention has weighed on his family.\n\n\"It has been hard,\" his father, Mikhail Gershkovich, told NBC News in March to mark the anniversary of his arrest. \"He spent all four seasons there, he spent his birthday and all the holidays. We want him home as soon as possible.\"\n\nHis parents left the then-Soviet Union for the U.S. during the Cold War. He and his older sister grew up speaking Russian at home, and the family calls him \"Vanya,\" the diminutive for his Russian name, Ivan.\n\nHis interest in Russia motivated his decision to move there in 2017 to work as a journalist.\n\nBut everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022, the family said. Like many other foreign reporters wary of Russia's tightening grip on press freedom, Gershkovich moved abroad, albeit regularly returning for reporting trips.\n\nSince his arrest, another American Russian journalist, Alsu Kurmasheva, has also been detained, along with several other U.S. nationals. The U.S. government has said this is a deliberate strategy by Putin to use them as geopolitical pawns.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gershkovich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gershkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gershkovich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evan Gershkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor-General_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor-General of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ural Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almar_Latour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Almar Latour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_M._Tracy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lynne M.

The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release. He said any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach.\"\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia's Foreign Ministry said it would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\"\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralvagonzavod", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uralvagonzavod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sverdlovsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sverdlovsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelimkhan_Khangoshvili", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zelimkhan Khangoshvili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chechens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_M._Tracy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynne M.

Gershkovich, The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government and Gershkovich's many colleagues all vehemently dispute he was working as a spy and say that he was doing his job as a reporter.\n\nGershkovich was on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg, the capital of the Sverdlovsk region, when he was arrested in March 2023.\n\nPreviously, prosecutors have alleged Gershkovich was working for a foreign intelligence service without specifying which one.\n\n\"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge,\" Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal publisher, and Emma Tucker, Wall Street Journal editor in chief, said in a joint statement published in The Wall Street Journal. \"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous.\"\n\nThey added, \"Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job.

Moving forward.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin made his first comments on Gershkovich's detention in months on June 5.\n\n\"I know that the United States administration is really taking energetic steps for his release. This is true. But such issues are not resolved through the media,\" Putin said. \"They love such a quiet, calm professional approach and dialogue between the intelligence services.\"\n\nHe added, \"You know, you believe that he is innocent, and Russian law enforcement agencies and special services believe that he committed illegal actions, which are called espionage. I will not go into details.\"\n\nGershkovich most recently appeared in court in Moscow for a pretrial hearing on April 23 as part of an appeal against the spying charges. His appeal was denied and he was ordered held through at least June 30.\n\nMORE: WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich's detention in Russia extended to June 30\n\nThe reporter smiled and gave a thumb's up when asked by ABC News inside the courtroom how he was doing.\n\n\"He has one more appeal that he can make, appealing his detention, but what's most likely going to happen before the 30th of June is Evan will be moved from Lefortovo, where he is currently held in prison, to instead Yekaterinburg, and when he gets out to Yekaterinburg, that's when the trial process most likely will start,\" U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Thursday during a hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nCarstens continued: \"I will tell you, if it's anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there will be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won't have any contact with him. It'll almost be like it's gone dark.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been negotiating the release of both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan since not long after their detentions. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, was also accused of spying in 2018 and convicted in June 2020. Like Gershkovich, he has been declared wrongfully detained by the U.S. government.\n\n\"We're going to continue to try to pursue his release,\" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Thursday of Gershkovich. \"We put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said publicly, we're continuing to work to secure their release.

The journalist has spent more than a year in pre-trial detention. The Russian Prosecutor General's Office said Thursday that Gershkovich would be sent to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, in the city where he was arrested, for trial at an unspecified date.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said that Gershkovich had been charged with espionage following an investigation by Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nIt said he had \"acted on instructions from the CIA\" and \"collected secret information\" about the mass tank manufacturer UralVagonZavod \"for the production and repair of military equipment.\"\n\nIt added, \"Illegal actions were carried out by Gershkovich in compliance with careful measures of secrecy.\"\n\nRussian authorities have presented no evidence to support their case.\n\nGershkovich's case has become a campaigning issue for journalists and government officials throughout the West, who see it emblematic of the war Putin has waged against freedom of speech both domestic and foreign.\n\nHis employer and U.S. officials have repeatedly rejected the charges as baseless. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said at a hearing in March that \"the accusations against Evan are categorically untrue.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gershkovich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evan Gershkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor-General_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor-General of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ural Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_M._Tracy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynne M.

Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the US government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe plant foreman appeared on Mr Putin's annual phone-in programme in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \"stability\", proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the capital to help suppress the unrest.\n\nA week later, Mr Putin appointed the plant foreman to be his envoy in the region.\n\nMr Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov.\n\nHe was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Mr Putin said the US is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release.\n\nHe told international news agencies in St Petersburg that any such releases \"aren't decided via mass media\" but through a \"discreet, calm and professional approach\".\n\n\"And they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\" he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap.\n\nGershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe was the first US journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War.\n\nGershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022.\n\nSince his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, a notorious tsarist-era prison used during Joseph Stalin's purges, when executions were carried out in its basement.\n\nUS ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \"fiction\" and said that Russia is \"using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends\".\n\nSince sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several US nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea.", "source": {"uri": "wandsworthguardian.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wandsworth Times"},

Gershkovich has vehemently denied the allegations against him, as has he diary and President Biden has called his ban \"totally illegalThe US government has designated Gershkovich \"wrongfully arrested,\" meaning the government considers him a political prisoner.\n\nRussian authorities allege that Gershkovich used covert methods to gather information about the Uralvagonzavod plant outside the Ural mountain city of Yekaterinburg, a facility that has been sanctioned by the west and plays an important role in building tanks and other weapons for Russia in its war against Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram, Russia's Prosecutor General's office claimed that Gershkovich had \"collected secret information\" under \"instructions from the CIA\". But prosecutors have not publicly presented any information or evidence to support their claims, and at the time of his arrest, Gershkovich was accredited to work in Russia by the country's foreign ministry.\n\nThe senior leadership of of Wall Street Journal responded to the Russian prosecutors' announcement by calling the charges against Gershkovich \"an attack on the free press.\"\n\n\"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge. Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and no less scandalous,\" said the paper's publisher, Almar Latour, and editor-in-chief of her, Emma Tucker. , in a statement. \"Evan's announcement from the Russian regime is despicable, despicable and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime,\" they added.\n\nThe US State Department also denounced the charges, with spokesman Matthew Miller telling reporters that Gershkovich \"must be released immediately\".\n\n\"There is absolutely zero credibility to these allegations,\" Miller said. \"We've been clear from the beginning that Evan did nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place.\"\n\nProsecutors did not say when they would begin proceedings against Gershkovich, but once they do, he faces the possibility of a trial behind closed doors, as Russian officials say the case involves classified information. If convicted, he could serve up to 20 years in prison.\n\nGershkovich is currently being held in custody at Lefortovo prison in Moscow, where according to diary he has been locked up 23 hours a day in his cell, leaving only for meetings with his lawyers or US embassy officials and for occasional court appearances.\n\nWith his arrest last year, Gershkovich became the first American journalist to be arrested by Russia on espionage charges since KGB operatives took reporter Nicholas Daniloff into custody in 1986. At the time, the effort to free Daniloff it meant the need to navigate Cold War tensions between Washington and Moscow. Now, the effort to negotiate Gershkovich's freedom has been complicated by deepening friction between the US and Russia over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGershkovich is not the only American currently being held in Russia. Paul Whelan, a former US Marine, is currently serving a 16-year sentence after being convicted ofsimilar charges, and Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist with the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty news service, has been arrested on charges of failing to register as a \"foreign agent\".\n\nIn recent years, the US has agreed to several notable prisoner exchanges with Russia. In 2022, the US secured the release of US Navy veteran Trevor Reed in exchange for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for conspiring to import more than $100 million worth of cocaine into the country.\n\nLater that year, the US released convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Boutin in exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner. While the families of the detained Americans have cheered the swaps, critics have said they encourage Russia to take more imprisoned Westerners to use as bargaining chips in the future.\n\nAddressing lawmakers on Capitol Hill Thursday, the president's special envoy for hostage issues, Roger Carstens, told House lawmakers that the announcement by Russian prosecutors was not unexpected.\n\n\"I think we were all hoping that we would be able to broker a deal with the Russians before this happened. But that doesn't stop us or slow us down. We can continue to pursue not only Evan's freedom, but the freedom and Paul Whelan, too,\" Carstens said in testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said he believes a deal could be reached to release Gershkovich, but in comments to international news agencies in St Petersburg last week, he suggested it would mean another prisoner swap. Negotiations \"are not decided through mass media,\" he said, but \"only on the basis of reciprocity.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" the Journal's chief editor Emma Tucker and top executives said in a statement.\n\nMoscow had previously not provided any public details of its case against Gershkovich, saying only that he was \"caught red-handed\".\n\nGershkovich became the first Western journalist since the Soviet era to be arrested for spying in Russia when he was detained.\n\nThe 32-year-old faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.\n\nRussia's latest move drew a fierce backlash from Washington, which declared Gershkovich \"wrongfully detained\" last year.\n\nThe label effectively means the White House regards him as a political hostage.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told journalists on Thursday the charges against Gershkovich had \"zero credibility\".\n\n\"We have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place,\" Miller said.\n\n\"The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they are false. He should be released immediately,\" he added.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also called for the reporter's release, saying he had been \"conducting his work as a journalist for free media\".\n\nWashington has accused Moscow of arresting its citizens on baseless charges to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said in February he would like to see Gershkovich freed as part of a prisoner exchange and that talks were ongoing.\n\nBut the Russian leader made clear he wanted any deal to involve the release of a Russian jailed in Germany for killing a Chechen dissident.\n\nAmong other US nationals detained in Russia is reporter Alsu Kurmasheva, detained last year for failing to register as a \"foreign agent\". Her employers denounced the case against her as politically motivated.\n\nFormer US marine Paul Whelan, in prison in Russia since 2018 and serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges, is also pushing to be included in any future prisoner exchange.\n\nGershkovich's family told AFP earlier this year they were counting on a \"very personal\" promise from President Joe Biden to bring him home.\n\nAt Lefortovo prison, the reporter shares a small cell with another inmate.\n\nHe gets an hour-long walk in a small prison yard every day, tries to stay fit through exercise and relies on

He also later worked for The Moscow Times from 2017 to 2020 and for Agence France-Presse (AFP) from 2020 onward until he joined The Wall Street Journal in January 2022.\n\nMr. Gershkovich's last article for The Wall Street Journal, which the publication published a day before his arrest on March 28, 2023, was titled \"Russia's Economy Is Starting to Come Undone\" and described signs of economic regression within Russia. The article, at points, emphasized the Russian government's efforts to expand the production of military equipment to meet demand stemming from the large-scale military operation it launched against Ukraine the year prior.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" Dow Jones CEO Almar Latour and The Wall Street Journal's Editor-in-Cheif Emma Tucker said in a joint press statement on June 13.\n\nThey added that the charges against Mr. Gershkovich were \"false and baseless.\"\n\n\"The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting, and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement continued. \"We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the U.S. government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nThe press freedom advocacy group Reporters Without Borders also denounced the new indictment in a June 13 press statement and called for Russian authorities to drop the espionage case and release Mr. Gershkovich.\n\nMr. Gershkovich is one of several Americans currently held in Russian custody.\n\nU.S. Army Staff Sgt. Gordon C. Black was arrested in the southeastern Russian port city of Vladivostok on theft charges after he traveled to the country during his transition period between duty stations in South Korea and Texas.\n\nLast October, Russian authorities arrested Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, alleging she failed to register as a foreign agent.\n\nRetired U.S. Marine Paul Whelan has been detained in Russia since December 2018. Like Mr. Gershkovich, he was arrested and charged with spying, even as the U.S. government insisted he was being wrongfully detained. A Russian jury found Mr. Whelan guilty of the charges in July 2020, and a court sentenced him to 16 years in prison.\n\nOther U.S. citizens detained in Russia include Travis Leake, a musician who had been living in Russia for years and was arrested last year on drug-related charges; Marc Fogel, a teacher in Moscow, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison, also on drug charges; and dual national Ksenia Khavana.\n\nEfforts to win the release of U.S. citizens detained in Russia are complicated by the strained relations between the two countries.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration arranged the release of WNBA basketball player Brittney Griner in December 2022. In return for Ms. Griner, the United States released Russian national Viktor Bout, who at the time had been serving a 25-year prison sentence following a 2011 conviction by a U.S. jury on charges of arms smuggling and conspiracy to kill Americans.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a rare statement on the case, Russia's general prosecutor said Gershkovich had been charged with collecting information about an arms factory that produced and repaired tanks and other armoured vehicles and military stock.\n\nRelated: 'He's not broken': a year later, Evan Gershkovich is still in Russian prison\n\n\"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge,\" the Wall Street Journal publisher, Almar Latour, and editor in chief, Emma Tucker, said in a statement. \"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies.\"\n\n\"Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement continued. \"We continue to demand his immediate release. We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the US government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nThe prosecutor provided no evidence for the accusations.\n\n\"The investigation established and documented that the American journalist of the Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich, on the instructions of the CIA in March 2023, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region about the activities of the defence enterprise ... [at] Uralvagonzavod [industrial complex] for the production and repair of military equipment,\" the prosecutor general's office said. \"The illegal actions were committed by Gershkovich in compliance with careful measures of secrecy.\"\n\nGershkovich was arrested during a reporting trip in Ekaterinburg in March 2023. He was accredited by the Russian foreign ministry to work in the country. His arrest has provoked protests and vigils by colleagues around the world.\n\nA spokesperson for Russia's state prosecutor said an investigation by Russia's security agency, the FSB, had been completed and the criminal case would be sent to the Sverdlovsk regional court, a precursor to the beginning of a criminal trial. It is expected that Gershkovich will be transferred from Moscow to the region before the trial begins. The maximum sentence is 25 years in prison.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, indicated in a recent interview with the US commenter Tucker Carlson that he was seeking to trade Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, a high-ranking colonel in the FSB. Krasikov is serving a life sentence in a German jail for the 2019 murder of an opponent of the Russian regime in the Tiergarten park in central Berlin.\n\nRelated: Evan Gershkovich: Biden 'working every day' to free WSJ reporter held in Russia\n\n\"We are not closed to negotiations,\" Putin said. \"Moreover, these negotiations are under way, and there have been many cases when we agreed. We can come to an agreement now, but we just need to agree.\"\n\nBoth Russia and the US have said that talks are ongoing to negotiate a prisoner exchange that could free Gershkovich. Previous trades have freed jailed Americans in exchange for high-profile Russian prisoners including the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\n\"We're encouraged to see Russia's desire for a deal that brings Evan home, and we hope this will lead to his rapid release and return to his family and our newsroom,\" the Journal said in response to Putin's interview. \"Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime. Any portrayal to the contrary is total fiction ... Evan was unjustly arrested and has been wrongfully detained by Russia for nearly a year for doing his job, and we continue to demand his immediate release.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

The city is about 1,400 kilometers east of Moscow.\n\nGershkovich, a Russia correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, has been jailed in Moscow since he was arrested in March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nGershkovich, his employer and the U.S. government all deny the accusations, and the U.S. State Department has declared the reporter wrongfully detained.\n\nThe 32-year-old is accused of \"gathering secret information\" about a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produced and repaired military equipment, the Prosecutor General's Office said in a statement.\n\nIt is the first time that Russia has publicly detailed the accusations against the journalist. Russian officials have not provided any evidence to substantiate the accusations against Gershkovich, who was accredited by the Foreign Ministry to work in the country.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Thursday reiterated its calls for Gershkovich's immediate release.\n\n\"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge. Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" Wall Street Journal publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.\n\n\"Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" they added in the statement.\n\nPress freedom groups also reaffirmed their condemnation of Gershkovich's jailing.\n\n\"He's held hostage by the Russian government, and the spying charges are completely fabricated,\" Jeanne Cavelier, who heads the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Desk at Reporters Without Borders, told VOA from Paris.\n\nRussia's Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment.\n\nIt is unclear when the trial will take place. Press freedom experts have previously told VOA a trial will almost certainly be a sham, but that it is a necessary step to securing Gershkovich's release through a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington.\n\nGershkovich is one of two American journalists currently jailed in Russia. The second - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Alsu Kurmasheva - has been jailed since October 2023 on charges of failing to self-register as a so-called foreign agent and spreading what Moscow views as false information about the Russian military.\n\nKurmasheva, a dual U.S.-Russian national, has denied the charges against her. The U.S. government has also called for her immediate release.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release.\n\nIn the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times.\n\nIn recent years, Russia has detained a number of other Americans. Ex-Marine Paul Whelan was arrested in 2018 and is also designated as wrongfully detained. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was detained in June 2023, Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was arrested in January, and American teacher Marc Fogel was arrested in August 2021.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Russian prosecutors on Thursday alleged without evidence that Gershkovich was gathering intelligence for the CIA about a Russian tank manufacturer.\n\nGershkovich, the office of Russia's General Prosecutor said, \"on the instructions of the CIA, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defense plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment.\"\n\nThe journalist is the latest American to face charges in Russia, which has been accused of falsely imprisoning Americans to gain leverage in disputes with the United States. Gershkovich could face up to 20 years in prison on the espionage charges.\n\nNo evidence has been presented to support the accusations against Gershkovich. He is the first American journalist arrested in Russia on espionage charges since the Cold War, Reuters reported.\n\nWhile the State Department has made efforts to secure Gershkovich's release, Russia and the United States have reportedly failed to reach a consensus on a deal that would free the journalist.\n\n\"The U.S. side is continuing to disregard our proposals,\" Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said in May. \"It's a highly delicate topic. In the past, we managed to come to a resolution on some of the high-profile cases but then came the long standstill that we're in now.\"\n\nThe Biden administration in December 2022 struck a deal to free WNBA player Britney Griner, imprisoned in Russia on drug charges. In exchange, the United States released Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms dealer nicknamed the \"Merchant of Death.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Marine Paul Whelan is also imprisoned in Russia on a 16-year sentence for charges of espionage. Alsu Kurmasheva, a U.S. citizen and Radio Free Europe journalist, is also being held for her role in editing a book that criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin, when asked about Gershkovich this month, suggested that the United States and Russia were discussing a new exchange.\n\n\"I know the United States administration is indeed taking vigorous steps to free him,\" Putin said. \"But such issues are not resolved through the media. They like a quiet, calm, professional approach and dialogue between intelligence agencies. And, of course, they should be resolved only on the basis of reciprocity.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Detained since March 2023, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, deny the accusations, calling them baseless.\n\nRussian prosecutors said on Thursday they had sent the case of detained U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich to court after concluding he had been collecting information for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency about a Russian tank factory. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested on March 29, 2023, in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on charges of espionage that carry up to 20 years in prison after the FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, said it had caught him \"red-handed\" trying to obtain military secrets.\n\nHe denies any wrongdoing and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement on Thursday after the latest Russian move that he was facing \"a false and baseless charge\" based on what it called \"calculated and transparent lies.\" President Joe Biden has called his detention \"totally illegal\". The Journal spoke out after the office of Russia's General Prosecutor said in a statement it had approved Gershkovich's criminal indictment and that his case would be heard by a court in Yekaterinburg.\n\nIt did not say when the case would be heard or whether the trial would be closed to the public as is common in such cases. \"The investigation has established and confirmed with documentary evidence that Gershkovich, an American journalist for The Wall Street Journal, on the instructions of the CIA, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defence plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment,\" the prosecutors' statement said.\n\n\"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\" it added. Prosecutors did not release any documentary evidence to back the charge.\n\nPRE-TRIAL DETENTION A joint statement from Almar Latour, his newspaper's publisher, and its editor in chief, Emma Tucker, demanded Gershkovich's immediate release.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" the statement said. \"Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies.\"\n\nLatour and Tucker said they now expected the U.S. government to redouble efforts to secure his release. The first U.S. journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, Gershkovich is currently being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow and had been the subject of prisoner exchange talks between Moscow and Washington.\n\nThe Uralvagonzavod factory, about which he is accused of gathering secret data, has been sanctioned by the West. Based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in the Sverdlovsk region, it plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow's war in Ukraine, according to the Russian defence ministry. The factory, which is run by a state conglomerate controlled by one of President Vladimir Putin's allies, has publicly spoken of producing T-90M battle tanks and modernising T-72B3M tanks.\n\nThe number of tanks which Russia has lost in battle in Ukraine is a military secret in Russia, which says it has ramped up tank production. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said in February that Russia had lost more than 3,000 tanks - the equivalent of its entire pre-war active inventory - but had enough lower-quality armoured vehicles in storage for years of replacements.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

He has remained in Russian custody for more than a year since the arrest.\n\nThe FSB alleged that Mr. Gershkovich was attempting to obtain classified information concerning Russia at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe translated press statement from the Russian prosecutor general's office said it had concluded Mr. Gershkovich, \"on instructions from the CIA,\" had collected secretive information about the activities of a Russian military equipment production and repair facility in the Sverdlovsk region. The prosecutor general's office said it has since referred the case to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court.\n\nThe Russian prosecutor general's announcement clears the way for Mr. Gershkovich's case to go to trial. The trial start date wasn't given.\n\nMr. Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of espionage.\n\nMr. Gershkovich was born in 1991 to Russian immigrants to the United States. He had bylines on several articles for The New York Times from 2016 to 2017.

The White House has called the charges \"ridiculous\", with President Joe Biden calling the detention \"totally illegal\".\n\nThe office of Russia's General Prosecutor said in a statement it had approved Gershkovich's criminal indictment and that his case would be heard by a court in Yekaterinburg, where he was originally arrested.\n\nIt did not say when the case would be heard or whether the trial would be closed to the public as is common in such cases.\n\n\"The investigation has established and confirmed with documentary evidence that Gershkovich, an American journalist for The Wall Street Journal, on the instructions of the CIA, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defence plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment,\" the prosecutors' statement said.\n\n\"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\" it added.\n\nProsecutors did not release any documentary evidence to back the charge.\n\nPRE-TRIAL DETENTION\n\nGershkovich, the first U.S. journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, is currently being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow and has been the subject of so far fruitless prisoner exchange talks between Moscow and Washington.\n\nThe Uralvagonzavod factory, which has been sanctioned by the West, is based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in Russia's Sverdlovsk region and, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe factory, which is controlled by a state conglomerate controlled by one of President Vladimir Putin's allies, has publicly spoken of producing T-90M battle tanks and of modernising T-72B3M tanks.\n\nThe number of tanks which Russia has lost in battle in Ukraine is a military secret in Russia, which says it has ramped up tank production.\n\nThe London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said in February that Russia had lost more than 3,000 tanks - the equivalent of its entire pre-war active inventory - but had enough lower-quality armoured vehicles in storage for years of replacements.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type":

In a rare statement on the case, Russia's general prosecutor said Gershkovich had been charged with collecting information about an arms factory that produced and repaired tanks and other armoured vehicles and military stock.\n\n\"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge,\" the Wall Street Journal publisher, Almar Latour, and editor in chief, Emma Tucker, said in a statement. \"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies.\"\n\n\"Evan's case is an assault on free press,\" the statement continued. \"We continue to demand his immediate release. We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the US government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nThe prosecutor provided no evidence for the accusations.\n\n\"The investigation established and documented that the American journalist of the Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich, on the instructions of the CIA in March 2023, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region about the activities of the defence enterprise ... [at] Uralvagonzavod [industrial complex] for the production and repair of military equipment,\" the prosecutor general's office said. \"The illegal actions were committed by Gershkovich in compliance with careful measures of secrecy.\"\n\nGershkovich was arrested during a reporting trip in Ekaterinburg in March 2023. He was accredited by the Russian foreign ministry to work in the country. His arrest has provoked protests and vigils by colleagues around the world.\n\nA spokesperson for Russia's state prosecutor said an investigation by Russia's security agency, the FSB, had been completed and the criminal case would be sent to the Sverdlovsk regional court, a precursor to the beginning of a criminal trial. It is expected that Gershkovich will be transferred from Moscow to the region before the trial begins. The maximum sentence is 25 years in prison.\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, indicated in a recent interview with the US commenter Tucker Carlson that he was seeking to trade Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, a high-ranking colonel in the FSB. Krasikov is serving a life sentence in a German jail for the 2019 murder of an opponent of the Russian regime in the Tiergarten park in central Berlin.\n\n\"We are not closed to negotiations,\" Putin said. \"Moreover, these negotiations are under way, and there have been many cases when we agreed. We can come to an agreement now, but we just need to agree.\"\n\nBoth Russia and the US have said that talks are ongoing to negotiate a prisoner exchange that could free Gershkovich. Previous trades have freed jailed Americans in exchange for high-profile Russian prisoners including the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\n\"We're encouraged to see Russia's desire for a deal that brings Evan home, and we hope this will lead to his rapid release and return to his family and our newsroom,\" the Journal said in response to Putin's interview. \"Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime. Any portrayal to the contrary is total fiction ... Evan was unjustly arrested and has been wrongfully detained by Russia for nearly a year for doing his job, and we continue to demand his immediate release.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov. He was serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent.\n\nAsked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \"taking energetic steps\" to secure his release.

The White House has called the charges \"ridiculous,\" with U.S. President Joe Biden calling the detention \"totally illegal.\"\n\nThe office of Russia's general prosecutor said in a statement it had approved Gershkovich's criminal indictment and that his case would be heard by a court in Yekaterinburg.\n\nIt did not say when the case would be heard or whether the trial would be closed to the public as is common in such cases.\n\n\"The investigation has established and confirmed with documentary evidence that Gershkovich, an American journalist for the Wall Street Journal, on the instructions of the CIA, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defence plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment,\" the prosecutor's statement said.\n\n\"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods.\"\n\nProsecutors did not release any documentary evidence to back up the charge.\n\nGershkovich, the first U.S. journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, is currently being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow and has been the subject of so far fruitless prisoner exchange talks between Moscow and Washington.\n\nThe Uralvagonzavod factory, which is subject to Western sanctions, is based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in Russia's Sverdlovsk region and, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe factory, which is controlled by a state conglomerate controlled by one of President Vladimir Putin's allies, has acknowledged that it produces T-90M battle tanks and modernizes T-72B3M tanks.\n\nThe number of tanks that Russia has lost in battle in Ukraine is a military secret in Russia, but the country has said it has ramped up tank production.\n\nThe London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said in February that Russia had lost more than 3,000 tanks -- the equivalent of its entire pre-war active inventory -- but had enough lower-quality armored vehicles in storage to supply years' worth of replacements.", "source":

If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nGershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have strongly denied the allegations against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which demanded his immediate release.\n\nRussian prosecutors said the federal domestic security service (FSB) had established and documented that Gershkovich was acting on instructions from the CIA in the month he was arrested, claiming he had gathered secret information about a Russian tank factory.\n\nGershkovich carried out the illegal acts using elaborate conspiratorial methods, a statement said.\n\nA year after his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison and his detention period has been extended many times.\n\nResponding to Thursday's announcement, WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge.\n\nRussia's latest move towards a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and no less scandalous. Evan spent 441 days wrongfully imprisoned in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. Evan's announcement from the Russian regimes is despicable, despicable and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evans' case is an attack on the free press, Tucker said in a statement.\n\nReporters Without Borders, an international group that promotes press freedom, denounced the Gershkovichs' lawsuit. The espionage charges should be dropped and Evan released immediately, a statement said.\n\nUS Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after the Gershkovichs' detention was extended in March, said: The Evans case is not about evidence, due process or the rule of law. It is about using American citizens as hostages to achieve political goals. She appealed to the Kremlin to let Evan go.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier this year that a deal could be struck with the United States to release Gershkovich after he brought the conviction of a Russian patriot killer to Germany.\n\nSpeaking in a lengthy and sometimes heavy-handed interview with right-wing American pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia's domestic spy organization who was convicted of murdering a former - Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019.\n\nListen, I will tell you: sitting in a country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a thug in one of the European capitals, Putin said.\n\nRussian government officials have previously requested that Krasikov be released as part of a proposed prisoner swap of notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, according to US officials and CNN reporting.\n\nGriner, a professional basketball player, was released in a prisoner swap for Bout, while Whelan, a former US Marine who says he was visiting Russia for a friends' wedding when he was arrested in Moscow in 2018, remains in prison.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich's detention, Polina Ivanova, one of his closest friends and a reporter for the Financial Times, said he was doing extremely well and spent most of his time writing letters. tried to make us feel better.\n\nWhen you see Putin talk about this in very clear terms that this is what they want to see happen, that they are looking for a deal, it gives you hope that at some point he will be home. He should be at home, Ivanova said.\n\nIn recent years, Russia has arrested a number of other Americans.

The White House has called the charges \"ridiculous\", with President Joe Biden calling the detention \"totally illegal\".\n\nThe office of Russia's General Prosecutor said in a statement it had approved Gershkovich's criminal indictment and that his case would be heard by a court in Yekaterinburg, where he was originally arrested.\n\nIt did not say when the case would be heard or whether the trial would be closed to the public as is common in such cases.\n\n\"The investigation has established and confirmed with documentary evidence that Gershkovich, an American journalist for The Wall Street Journal, on the instructions of the CIA, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region in March 2023 about the activities of the defence plant NPK Uralvagonzavod JSC on the production and repair of military equipment,\" the prosecutors' statement said.\n\n\"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\" it added.\n\nProsecutors did not release any documentary evidence to back the charge.\n\nPRE-TRIAL DETENTION\n\nGershkovich, the first U.S. journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, is currently being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow and has been the subject of so far fruitless prisoner exchange talks between Moscow and Washington.\n\nThe Uralvagonzavod factory, which has been sanctioned by the West, is based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in Russia's Sverdlovsk region and, according to the Russian Defence Ministry, plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe factory, which is controlled by a state conglomerate controlled by one of President Vladimir Putin's allies, has publicly spoken of producing T-90M battle tanks and of modernising T-72B3M tanks.\n\nThe number of tanks which Russia has lost in battle in Ukraine is a military secret in Russia, which says it has ramped up tank production.\n\nThe London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said in February that Russia had lost more than 3,000 tanks - the equivalent of its entire pre-war active inventory - but had enough lower-quality armoured vehicles in storage for years of replacements.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Gareth Jones)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com",

If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nGershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release.\n\nRussian prosecutors said the country's federal security service (FSB) had \"established and documented\" that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \"collected secret information\" about a Russian tank factory.\n\n\"Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIn the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times.\n\nReporters Without Borders, an international group promoting press freedom, denounced Gershkovich's indictment. \"The espionage accusations must be abandoned and Evan immediately liberated,\" it said in a statement.\n\nUS Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich's pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: \"Evan's case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\" She called on the Kremlin \"to let Evan go.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier in the year that \"an agreement can be reached\" with the United States to release Gershkovich, as he brought up the conviction of a \"patriotic\" Russian hitman in Germany.\n\nSpeaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia's domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019.\n\n\"Listen, I'll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\" Putin said.\n\nRussian government officials have previously requested that Krasikov be released as part of a proposed prisoner swap of notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan according to US officials and CNN reporting.\n\nGriner, a professional basketball player, was freed in a prisoner exchange for Bout while Whelan - a former US marine who says he was visiting Russia for a friend's wedding when he was arrested in Moscow in 2018 - remains in prison.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich's detention, Polina Ivanova - one of his closest friends and a reporter at the Financial Times - said he was doing \"remarkably well\" and passing most of his time writing letters \"trying to make us feel better.\"\n\n\"When you see Putin talk about it in very clear terms that this is what they want to see happen, that they are looking for a deal, it gives you hope that at some point he will be home. He needs to be home,\" Ivanova said.\n\nIn recent years, Russia has detained a number of other Americans. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was detained in June 2023, Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was arrested in January, and American teacher Marc Fogel was arrested in August 2021.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Her employers denounced the case against her as politically motivated.\n\nFormer US marine Paul Whelan, in prison in Russia since 2018 and serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges, is also pushing to be included in any future prisoner exchange.\n\nGershkovich's family told AFP earlier this year they were counting on a \"very personal\" promise from President Joe Biden to bring him home.\n\nAt Lefortovo prison, the reporter shares a small cell with another inmate.\n\nHe gets an hour-long walk in a small prison yard every day, tries to stay fit through exercise and relies on fruit and vegetables sent by friends to supplement the meagre prison diet.\n\nbur/jj\n\nMore from this section\n\nMortgage Interest Rate Sensitivity Triggers 25% Spike in May Rate-and-Term Refinance

It is unclear when the trial will start or how long it may take.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal denies the Russian claim and said that the reporter was only doing his job and was not involved in any wrongdoing. The White House has labelled his arrest \"ridiculous\" and President Biden has called on Moscow to \"let him go\".\n\nWhile on assignment, Gershkovich was said to have tried to speak to employees of the defence plant, which is in the city of Nizhny Tagil and manufactures T-14 Armata and T-90M Proryv tanks.\n\nPresident Putin claimed in an interview with the former Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson in February that Gershkovich had been caught \"red-handed\" when he \"received classified information on a secret basis\". The Russian prosecutors allege that Gershkovich had \"carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods\".\n\nIn a statement Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and Emma Tucker, editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal, demanded Gershkovich's immediate release and urged the Biden administration to \"redouble efforts to get Evan released\".\n\nThey said: \"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge. Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist.

Evan's case is an assault on the free press.\"\n\nAfter the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, 47, in a penal colony in February, his associates revealed that negotiations had been under way to swap Navalny and two American citizens in jail in Russia for Vadim Krasikov, an FSB-hired hitman who is serving a life sentence in Germany.

They say Gershkovich was merely doing his job as an accredited reporter when he was arrested.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in December that Moscow rejected a significant offer it made to secure the release of Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges.\n\nAnother U.S. citizen currently held by Russian authorities is Alsu Kurmasheva, an RFE/RL journalist who was arrested in Kazan, the capital of Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, in October 2023 and charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" and spreading falsehoods about the Russian military.\n\nPrior to her arrest, Kurmasheva, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, had her passport confiscated following a visit to care for her mother. RFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charges against her are reprisals for her work.\n\nRussian officials have kept mum about any talks to win the release of the Americans. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has repeatedly said that while \"certain contacts\" on swaps continue, \"they must be carried out in absolute silence.\"\n\nMany analysts and officials say it appears as though Russia is targeting American citizens to detain for potential use in prisoner exchanges or for other geopolitical purposes.\n\nRussia is believed to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, who was given a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing of Zelimkhan \"Tornike\" Khangoshvili, a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, asked in February about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for

The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.\n\nThe Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence.\n\nUralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin.", "source": {"uri": "montrealgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Montreal Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralvagonzavod", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uralvagonzavod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sverdlovsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sverdlovsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizhny_Tagil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nizhny Tagil"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nizhny Tagil"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/files-russia-us-rights-espionage-gershkovich.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649458", "eventUri": "eng-9649458", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Russia will try Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges amid US attempts to secure his release in a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian prosecutor-general's office said on Thursday that it had filed an indictment against Gershkovich more than a year after he was arrested in Ekaterinburg, a city in the Russian defence industry's heartland in the Ural Mountains.\n\nThe announcement means Gershkovich's case will probably go to court in the coming weeks, suggesting he could soon be moved from Moscow's Lefortovo prison.\n\nThe facility is run by Russia's FSB security service, the successor agency to the KGB, and is notorious for isolating inmates from the outside world.\n\nHis trial is likely to be held in secret, common practice for espionage cases in Russia, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors said Gershkovich used \"careful measures of clandestine activity\" on an assignment from the CIA to obtain \"secret information\" about production and repair efforts at Uralvagonzavod, a big tank factory in the region.\n\nDespite claiming to have caught him \"red-handed\", Russian prosecutors have provided no evidence of his guilt in public and held his bail hearings behind closed doors.\n\nThe US and the WSJ have said the charges against the 32-year-old reporter are baseless.\n\nUS officials are trying to secure a release for Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a US Marine veteran sentenced to 16 years in prison for espionage in 2020, in exchange for Russian prisoners held in the west.\n\nRussia has previously swapped other prominent US citizens after they have been convicted and sentenced.\n\nIn 2022, Moscow traded US basketball star Brittney Griner following her sentencing on drug charges for Viktor Bout, an arms dealer known as the \"Merchant of Death.\"\n\nPutin said last week that the US was \"taking energetic steps to free [Gershkovich]\" but warned that \"these issues [\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009] should only be solved on a reciprocal basis\".\n\nThe Russian president strongly hinted in February that he was demanding the release of Vadim Krasikov, a hitman sentenced to life in prison in Germany in 2021, in exchange.\n\nEfforts to swap Krasikov for Gershkovich, Whelan and jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, however, subsequently collapsed when the dissident died in a remote Arctic penal colony months later.\n\nNavalny's supporters have accused Putin of murdering him to scupper the deal.\n\nPutin said in March he had agreed to an informal proposal to release Navalny on the condition that he never returned to Russia but denied any involvement in his \"tragic\" death.\n\nPeople briefed on the talks say the Russian president is fixated on releasing Krasikov, who murdered a former Chechen militant in broad daylight in Berlin's central Tiergarden park in 2019.\n\nRussia has arrested several more Americans in recent months.\n\nThey include Gordon Black, a US soldier arrested on theft charges while visiting his girlfriend in the eastern city of Vladivostok in May, as well as US-Russia dual nationals Alsu Kurmasheva and Ksenia Khavana.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

Gershkovich's detention has been condemned by his employer and press freedom groups, and the US has classified Gerskovich as \"wrongfully detained.\"\n\nIn a Telegram post, the Prosecutor General's office reiterated that Gerskovich was charged under Article 276 of Russia's criminal code, which punishes the transfer of state secrets by foreign citizens with 10 to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors claimed that Gershkovich collected information about Russian government-owned defense manufacturer NPK Uralvagonzavod on behalf of the CIA. The US has sanctioned the weapons maker over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGershkovich has unsuccessfully attempted to appeal the charges against him. The journalist's pretrial detention has been extended five times since his March 2023 arrest.\n\nAs the OSCE's media freedom representative presented a report Thursday outlining threats to the free press, US Charge d'Affaires to the OSCE Katherine Brucker renewed the US's call for Gershkovich's release. \"We call for the release of all those incarcerated for carrying out their journalistic duties, including Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva who are among the dozens of media workers currently held in Russia. Journalism is not a crime, nor should it be a death sentence,\" Brucker said.\n\nPress freedom in Russia has been almost nonexistent since its invasion of Ukraine, according to press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Last week Russia banned the entry of a number of British journalists and politicians over \"instilling Russophobia and spreading disinformation.\" On June 2, the country also extended the detention of Russian-American RadioFreeEurope Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) journalist Alsu Kurmasheva on charges of failure to register as a foreign agent.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_hibbitts@jurist.org", "name": "William Hibbitts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yekaterinburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gershkovich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evan Gershkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralvagonzavod", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uralvagonzavod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Russian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Russian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Agents Registration Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reporters Without Borders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/Copy-of-Putin-and-Stalin.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649458", "eventUri": "eng-9649458", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 1856, "textEnd": 1862}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Here's what else we know.", "body": "Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested in Russia on espionage charges last year, will stand trial in a city 870 miles east of Moscow, where he was detained, according to local authorities.\n\nFor the first time since Gershkovich was detained in March 2023, details of the accusations against him were revealed in an indictment that claims he was \"gathering secret information\" on behalf of the CIA regarding a Russian facility that produces and repairs military equipment.\n\nThere was no indication of when Gershkovich's trial would begin, but an espionage trial in Russia could take many months, according to the WSJ. If convicted, the reporter faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe American journalist, the WSJ and the U.S. deny all the espionage charges.\n\n\"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\" said Emma Tucker, the WSJ's editor-in-chief. \"Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press. We had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the U.S. government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department denounced the charges and said there is \"absolutely zero credibility\" to them. \"We have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should have never been arrested in the first place,\" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nPreviously on Dec. 5, 2023, the State Department said that the Biden administration made a new offer to secure the release of Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American detained in Russia, but Moscow rejected it. The State Department didn't reveal the details of the offer or why Moscow rejected it.\n\nFollowing Putin's remarks on Dec. 14, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, \"We would welcome them engaging seriously with us to obtain the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, but so far we have seen them refuse to take us up on our proposals, and we hope that they will change the way they've handled this going forward.\"\n\nGershkovich, 32, is a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and was accredited to work as a journalist by the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the Journal.\n\nHe was detained by the country's Federal Security Service on March 29, 2023, while on assignment in Yekaterinburg, about 1,200 miles east of Moscow, just a day after he co-authored an article on Russia's declining economy following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the time he was accused of espionage, Russian authorities didn't provided detailed evidence to support the allegation. Gershkovich is being held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison, infamous for its harsh conditions.\n\nWhelan, a former U.S. Marine, is a corporate security executive from Michigan who holds U.S., Canadian, British and Irish citizenships. He has been detained by Russian authorities for over five years -- since Dec. 28, 2018 -- and was imprisoned on espionage charges for his alleged involvement in an intelligence operation. He, his family and the U.S. have said the allegation is false. Whelan said he was in Moscow to attend a friend's wedding.\n\nIn 2020 Whelan was sentenced to 16 years in a remote prison labor camp in Mordovia, where he has been detained ever since. \"If I had known that there would be any sort of problem, I would never have come here,\" Whelan told CNN via phone from the prison camp in December.\n\nWhelan also called on President Biden to \"please use every resource available to secure my release as you would do if your own son had been taken hostage.\"\n\nBack in July 2022, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a proposal was made to Moscow for the release of Whelan and WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner was released in a prisoner swap in December 2022, but Whelan wasn't part of the deal.\n\nWhelan told the BBC last December that he feels like the U.S. has left him behind.\n\n\"A serious betrayal. It's extremely frustrating,\" Whelan said. \"I know that the U.S. has come up with all sorts of proposals -- serious proposals -- but it's not what the Russians are after. So they keep going back and forth. The only problem is, it's my life that's draining away while they do this.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in an online statement lauding the Belt and Road initiative that it would provide better guidance on risks to companies investing overseas in order to prevent \"vicious\" competition and corruption. The state planner also cited unspecified security risks for Chinese companies investing abroad. The NDRC did not give more details about how it planned to strengthen current rules or why it was concerned about corruption and unhealthy competition between companies.\n\nMergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries linked to the Belt and Road initiative have been growing at a rapid rate, even as Beijing takes aim at China's acquisitive conglomerates to restrict capital outflows. Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project aims to boost trade and investment along two routes - one along the ancient \"Silk Road\", connecting China by land and sea through Central Asia and the Middle East to Europe, and the second linking it to Southeast Asia and Africa. However, the initiative has also come with some security concerns for China. This year, militants in Pakistan, a key Belt and Road partner, killed 10 workers and two teachers from China.\n\nThe largest deal in a Belt and Road country so far this year was a Chinese consortium's $11.6 billion buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties. Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially associated with President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy totalled $33 billion as of Aug. 14, surpassing the $31 billion for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. Lawyers and dealmakers had told Reuters that companies were enjoying a relatively smooth approval process for Belt and Road-related deals as regulators tended to classify them differently when reviewing outbound investments.\n\nChina has tightened outbound capital controls and cracked down on overseas deals it sees as risky, putting pressure on acquisitive conglomerates like Anbang Insurance Group , HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun International Ltd (0656.HK). In the statement Friday, the NDRC cited projects such as a high-speed railway in Indonesia and a crude oil pipeline between southwest China and Myanmar as examples of how the initiative was advancing. Up to the end of 2016, Chinese companies had invested more than $18.5 billion to build economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 countries along the Belt and Route routes, it said.", "id": "9858711",

This year, militants in Pakistan, a key Belt and Road partner, killed 10 workers and two teachers from China.\n\nThe largest deal in a Belt and Road country this year was a Chinese consortium's US$11.6 billion (RM49.7 billion) buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties.\n\nChinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially associated with President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy totalled US$33 billion as of August 14, surpassing the US$31 billion for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nLawyers and dealmakers had told Reuters that companies were enjoying a relatively smooth approval process for Belt and Road-related deals as regulators tended to classify them differently when reviewing outbound investments.\n\nChina has tightened outbound capital controls and cracked down on overseas deals it sees as risky, putting pressure on acquisitive conglomerates like Anbang Insurance Group, HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun International Ltd (0656.HK).\n\nIn the statement today, the NDRC cited projects such as a high-speed railway in Indonesia and a crude oil pipeline between southwest China and Myanmar as examples of how the initiative was advancing.\n\nUp to the end of 2016, Chinese companies had invested more than US$18.5 billion to build economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 countries along the Belt and Route routes, it said.\n\nThe State Council said capable firms were encouraged to invest overseas in sectors including agriculture and high-tech manufacturing, while mining, oil, and gas developments based on \"prudent assessments\" are also encouraged.\n\nIt reiterated that investment in property, hotels, entertainment, sports club, and film industries would be restricted, as will investment projects that do not meet environmental protection or safety standards.\n\nInvestment in gambling and pornography, and some core defence technologies, and those that use technology not permitted for export are forbidden, the State Council said. -- Reuters", "id": "9897390", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "China to curb 'irrational' overseas Belt and Road investment, says state planner",

Because Belt and Road strategy development needs both real economy and financial collaboration, the UK's strength in financial services gives it a unique advantage,\" Xue said.\n\nThe number of Chinese deals targeting Belt and Road countries totaled 109 this year, compared to 175 in the whole of last year and 134 in 2015, the Thomson Reuters data showed.\n\nThe largest deal in a Belt and Road country so far this year was a Chinese consortium's .6 billion buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties, announced in July. The consortium comprises Hopu Investment Management, Hillhouse Capital Group, Vanke Group and Bank of China Group Investment.\n\nAnother top deal is China National Petroleum Corp's .8 billion purchase of an 8 per cent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, announced in February.\n\nAndrew Monk, CEO of VSA Capital Plc, a London-based investment bank with a subsidiary in Shanghai, said from his observations most of China's outbound deals along the Belt and Road countries fit into China's strategic development.\n\n\"The deals done so far are in sectors that add value to China's strategic growth, especially in areas such as technology, renewable energy and green industries,\" he said.", "id": "9801708", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "China focuses investment on Belt and

Some of the nation's most aggressive dealmakers, including Anbang Insurance Group, Fosun International, Dalian Wanda Group and HNA Group, have come under scrutiny.\n\nThe State Council said outbound investment will be judged according to three categories: banned, restricted and encouraged.\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your inboxSign Up\n\nThe government is trying to curtail capital outflows that weaken the yuan and drain capital reserves. The People's Bank of China imposed controls as the amount of money flowing out last year topped US$816 billion (S$1 trillion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with Macau casinos considered a primary exit used by private citizens and corrupt government officials alike.\n\nThe banking regulator this year asked lenders to provide loan information on the country's top deal-making companies, and is examining examples of acquisitions gone awry by those firms to assess potential risks to the financial sector, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn a separate statement, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said it sees \"irrational\" overseas investment in some sectors, while others more appropriate to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are encouraged.\n\nThe NDRC, in an online statement, lauded the BRI, saying that it would provide better guidance on risks to companies investing overseas in order to prevent \"vicious\" competition and corruption.\n\nThe NDRC did not give more details about how it planned to strengthen current rules or why it was concerned about corruption and unhealthy competition between companies.\n\nMergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries linked to the BRI have been growing at a rapid rate, even as Beijing takes aim at China's acquisitive conglomerates to restrict capital outflows.\n\nUnveiled in 2013, the BRI aims to boost trade and investment along two routes - one along the ancient Silk Road, connecting China by land and sea through Central Asia and the Middle East to Europe, and the second linking it to Southeast Asia and Africa.\n\nHowever, the initiative has also come with some security concerns for China. This year, militants in Pakistan, a key BRI partner, killed 10 workers and two teachers from China.\n\nLawyers and dealmakers had told Reuters that companies were enjoying a relatively smooth approval process for BRI-related deals as regulators tended to classify them differently when reviewing outbound investments.", "id": "9877987", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "China further

Some companies disregarded the environment, energy and safety regulations in target countries, which resulted in disputes and impaired China's image, it said.\n\nChina's outbound investment slumped 44.3 percent in the first seven months from a year earlier as policy makers imposed brakes on companies' foreign acquisition following a record spending spree in 2016.\n\n\"China wants its money to focus on specific sectors that can help boost long-term growth potential,\" said Zhou Hao, a senior emerging-markets strategist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore. \"The new policy also tries to close the loophole of suspicious capital outflows and possible money laundering.\"", "id": "9880331", "details": {"liCnt": 22, "gpCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "China Lays Down Outbound Investment Rules in Bid to Cut Risk", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iLXeaAc11e0o/v0/1200x800.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "113", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65590", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Financial services"}, "id": "302748", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services"}, {"label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}, "id": "303075", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bank"}, "id": "303134", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}, {"label": {"eng": "Money"}, "id": "303547", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"}, {"label": {"eng": "Financial market"}, "id": "304730", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}, "id": "309717", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping"}, {"label": {"eng": "State Council of the People's Republic of China"}, "id": "320071", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hainan Airlines"}, "id": "323984", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_Airlines"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Development and Reform Commission"}, "id": "360843", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "People's Bank of China"}, "id": "375147", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Bank_of_China"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fosun International Limited"}, "id": "375338", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosun_International_Limited"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gambling in Macau"}, "id": "729391", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_in_Macau"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Belt, One Road"}, "id": "1270774", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Belt,_One_Road"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anbang Insurance Group"}, "id": "1276360", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anbang_Insurance_Group"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wanda Group"}, "id": "1276781", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Group"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 149, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 431, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 598, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 642, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 944, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate"}], "time": "11:21:00"}

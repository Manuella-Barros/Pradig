His progression on the programme has seen him reporting on Newshub's 6pm bulletin and The Hui.\n\nHe has also been involved with daily editorial meetings, which gave him a say on angles and perspective into M\u0101ori kaupapa.\n\n\"Sometimes these stories are quite complex and need a bit more background knowledge as well, so yeah, there's certainly a need and more of a need to have M\u0101ori leaders and M\u0101ori storytellers in those editorial meetings to make sure these stories aren't getting missed by the mainstream.\n\n\"They have a really important place in obviously news and current affairs, but especially morning news and current affairs,\" Redman said.\n\nOne tane instrumental in getting more use of te reo M\u0101ori off the ground - not only for AM but the entirety of Newshub - was Eru Paranihi.\n\nHe helped with a campaign in 2020 to drive more use of te reo M\u0101ori during Te Wiki O Te Reo M\u0101ori.\n\nBefore this he produced many segments for M\u0101ori language week including one with actress Jennifer Ward-Lealand in 2018 about learning the language.\n\nThe former AM Show producer said during his time there, it was the start of Newshub's journey at lifting the use of te reo on screen.\n\n\"It was an opportunity to use a platform and I guess promote te reo M\u0101ori in a way that resonated with New Zealanders with a wider audience, as opposed to a M\u0101ori audience as well.\n\n\"There were definitely opportunities for its promotion, definitely opportunities to uplift its mana. Yeah, that was pivotal back then,\" Paranihi said.\n\nPresenter and reporter Michael O'Keeffe was one of the kaimahi M\u0101ori inspired by his own children and Eru Paranihi's work, and used te reo when reading the weather.\n\nHe is on his reo journey and wants to teach viewers M\u0101ori place names, including smaller towns in Aotearoa.\n\n\"If I could help say not just probably the reo M\u0101ori names for the main centres, but also as well Whakat\u016b Nelson, Whakaoriori - Masterton, T\u0101huna Queenstown.

A new biography of photographer Ans Westra, who documented M\u0101ori life in the 1960s and 70s, poses a challenge, a confrontation, about the ways P\u0101keh\u0101 see and record M\u0101ori; and, even more tone-deaf in old age (literally deaf! I can't leave the house without hearing aids) than I was in youth, I have gone about responding to the book this week by publishing three pieces by whitey. On Monday, an extract by the book's author, Paul Moon. On Tuesday, a critical review of Moon's book by Scott Hamilton. And now here I am with my own hardly even two-cents worth, because you just can't have enough P\u0101keh\u0101 perspectives....Talia Marshall (Ng\u0101ti Kuia, Ng\u0101ti R\u0101rua, Rangit\u0101ne \u014d Wairau, Ng\u0101ti Takihiku) writes about the book - and the issues it raises about that quaint old concept you never hear much about anymore, biculturalism - in ReadingRoom tomorrow. At least, and at last, one M\u0101ori perspective, although not the M\u0101ori perspective, there being no such homologous thing.\n\nAnyway. What do we see when we look at Westra's famous photos taken in Ruatoria and the streets of Wellington? Do we see M\u0101ori as they are, or do we see them as manipulated and cast in ideological roles by Westra? Ooh here's another question: speaking of myself, as a certain kind of New Zealander (64 tomorrow, my hair as white as the snow that fell in my father's mountains homelands of Austria) what the hell would I know about it, and, in a larger sense, where does that leave other P\u0101keh\u0101 writers (and photographers, and whatever other kind of documentary makers) as they go about wanting to describe New Zealand, in full, in 2024? The answers to these latter two questions are a) I know nothing, b) other P\u0101keh\u0101 writers often make themselves kind of...absent.\n\nPaul Moon blandly asserts Westra as a great artist, creating \"an entrancing amalgam of scenes that reflected the essence of the nation's intricately-marbled identity\". Beware whitey claiming to know a nation's \"essence\". I have claimed it over many years in my journalism and books, and essentially it's based on a sentimental, affectionate regard for the kinds of people that I identify with as the son of an Austrian housepainter (no, not that Austrian housepainter) - the white lower middle-class, who are usually good at something. I recently celebrated a plumber in Dunedin and a stamp collector in Picton. I interviewed them for a story about the King's Birthday Honours List. I celebrated the honours list, too: \"It honours the approved and official version of the New Zealand way of life as lived by people simply going about their business.\" There were plenty of M\u0101ori in the Honours List. I didn't interview them. There are thriving, fascinating versions of the New Zealand way of life (as lived by people of colour, and by people somewhere on the LGBTIQA+ spectrum) that I know nothing about. I don't tend to write about these diversities. I feel as though I'd get it wrong, fail to understand context.\n\nScott Hamilton regarded the Westra biography as \"flawed\"; he suggested that Moon, a much-published historian, shared the same narrow focus and \"agenda\" about M\u0101ori as Westra. He writes, \"It's tempting to see a parallel between the careers of historian and the photographer: both are P\u0101keh\u0101 who have worked often with M\u0101ori material, and both have been accused of misusing this material.\" Later in his thorough, and thoroughly brilliant review, he notes that it's \"not the mere fact that they [Moon and Westra] have touched M\u0101ori material\", it's the morally dubious ways they go about it. He states that artists and scholars such as Marti Friedlander, Vincent Ward, Anne Salmond, Judith Binney, and Michael King \"have worked with M\u0101ori subject matter without attracting similar responses\".\n\nWell - that's not maybe entirely right. It's well-known that King was told to get the hell off the marae by some M\u0101ori critics of his work; they were sick of him telling their stories, and King responded by saying okay, adios. He absented himself. He turned his interests to literary biography, with books on Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson, those pioneers of the white literary experience in these islands. He also wrote a memoir with the regrettable title Being Pakeha Now. Feeling expelled from brown really made him rediscover his white.\n\nI haven't attempted a survey - yes, that might have been useful - but sometimes I wonder whether very many European New Zealand writers, novelists in particular, have followed King's example and avoided working \"with M\u0101ori subject matter\". What I mean is that you don't tend to see an awful lot of M\u0101ori characters in novels by European New Zealand authors. As in very commonly kind of like close to none. Number of M\u0101ori characters in Lioness by Emily Perkins, winner of the Acorn fiction prize at this year's Ockhams: one. Number of M\u0101ori characters in Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton, shortlisted for the Acorn prize and the biggest-selling New Zealand novel of 2023 by a long stretch: none.\n\nCatton was aware of that. It was a conscious decision. It was a matter, as she said in an interview in Bookman, of cultural sensitivity: \"She deliberately omitted a M\u0101ori perspective because she wanted to satirise the relationship people have with the land, the arbitrariness of who owns it, and it didn't feel appropriate to satirise that of an indigenous person.\"\n\nWhite people writing brown enters the arena of culture wars. If they do it, it opens itself up to cultural appropriation; if they don't, it can look like they're erasing M\u0101ori. But it's not like there should be some kind of quota for M\u0101ori characters in European New Zealand fiction. As for M\u0101ori fiction, novelists as wide-ranging as Becky Manawatu, Witi Ihimaera, Stacy Gregg, Alan Duff, Patricia Grace, Airana Ngarewa, Paula Morris, Monty Soutar, and, in her debut novel published soon, Shilo Kino, all write M\u0101ori characters. This doesn't resolve the issue but it does speak to the idea that stories about M\u0101ori are better told by M\u0101ori.\n\nI wrote a chapter about Rotorua in my 2013 book Civilisation: 20 Places on the Edge of the World. I wandered around Ohinemutu and Whakarewarewa, and interviewed people who I came across, which is to say that everyone I came across was M\u0101ori. One person I spoke to, and remember fondly, was a striking and tragic woman called Ata. She was proud, deeply impressive in many ways; she was also an alcoholic, and lived in poverty, in a caravan. She spoke about her life very honestly and openly. She was happy to talk; it was something to do to pass the time between drinking all day. It was a good interview. But I don't know if I'd just bowl into Ohinemutu and Whakarewarewa in 2024, and approach complete strangers for an interview. I think I'd stay away. I don't think I'd feel comfortable telling their stories.", "source": {"uri": "newsroom.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsroom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_braunias@newsroom.co.nz", "name":

The campaign helped Samoa gain independence in 1962.\n\nTe P\u0101ti M\u0101ori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer (Ng\u0101ti Ruanui, Ng\u0101ruahine, and Ng\u0101 Rauru) says the new parliament will also create a safe home for all people.\n\nSpeaking from Hawai'i while attending the Festival of Pacific Arts, she said the party was holding talks \"to form a government for the right to execute authority for M\u0101ori\".\n\nShe said neither the blue nor red governments \"consistently respected M\u0101ori issues and that also disrespects Pacific people.\n\n\"I guess we're really lucky for us as Pasifika because Ng\u0101 Tini Whet\u016b, the stars, connect us all, so this is about reconnecting ourselves back to how we should be,\" Ngarewa-Packer told Pacific Mornings' William Terite.\n\nBy reconnection, Ngarewa-Packer referred to how M\u0101ori had their parliament in the 1800s which was forced to end in 1902 by the colonialists.\n\nTe P\u0101ti M\u0101ori issued a Declaration of Political Independence, Te Ng\u0101kau o Te Iwi M\u0101ori, last month imploring all M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori to sign it.\n\nThe move also began the process of establishing the M\u0101ori parliament as thousands of people joined a h\u012bkoi for National M\u0101ori Action Day, spearheaded by the political party.\n\nThe protest also coincided with the Budget announcements by Finance Minister Nicola Willis.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" a statement from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori read.\n\nNgarewa-Packer said Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori was proud to be an activist party, not a political one, hence the push for a new parliament.\n\n\"It's really important as the only activist party that we reclaim and make sure our generations know that the rangatiratanga is something within our reach, what it needs to look like, how we claim that is something we need to make sure it's something our next generation is talking about.\n\n\"At no stage do I think it's going to be something that starts and finishes in my lifetime, many have dropped this k\u014drero about independence, about us looking after ourselves and again reminding M\u0101ori that we never ceded sovereignty.\"\n\nTe P\u0101ti Maori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke (Ng\u0101 Puhi, Waikato, Taranaki, Ng\u0101ti Porou, and Ng\u0101i Tahu) said the new campaign was about abiding by the Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi).\n\n\"You look at the treaty and the key messages because it's a simple treaty, you can come over here with your people. We allow you, we welcome you, you govern over your people and we'll govern over our people.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees with Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori. The coalition government has opposed the idea, and the K\u012bngitanga has questions.\n\nBut Maipi-Clarke said in the past, many M\u0101ori were against making te reo M\u0101ori an official language, introducing kura kaupapa (M\u0101ori language school), or forming their political party.\n\nBut she said judging from the turnout at the national h\u012bkoi including the November and Te Hui \u0101 Motu ki Turangawaewae, there was growing support from the public.\n\n\"We're lucky that every activation has been peaceful, mokopuna-driven and it's been about uniting people under a real positive umbrella because people are so frustrated and they don't know how to express that emotion.\n\n\"So we've really made sure to be like 'no wh\u0101anau'. Let's find the light, let's find the light.\n\n\"When that treaty principal bill comes in, when you look at our wh\u0101nau over in Kanaky, with the New Caledonian government with the French, how absolutely insane has that unfolded.\"\n\nThe National Party said Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori's move was \"just a publicity stunt\".\n\nACT leader David Seymour said he hoped to see the backs of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori from Parliament so \"they can stop distracting people from the real issues affecting New Zealand\".\n\nLabour's Carmel Sepuloni said the party did not \"support this specific action\", but backed the nationwide protests.\n\nWhile in Hawai'i, Ngarewa-Packer said she has been connecting with Ariki (leaders) from across the Moana (ocean) to hear their perspectives on the issue.\n\nLed by Royal Ariki of Hawai'i His Grace Prince David Kaw\u0101nanakoa and M\u0101ori King Tuuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, the paramount chiefs and traditional leaders pledged to bolster regional unity.\n\nThey signed the Tuurama Ariki Declaration as their promise to use ancient indigenous expertise to guide generations forward for the protection and preservation of connection to culture, spirituality, land, and sea.\n\nNgarewa-Packer said she also hoped to create models for M\u0101ori to use on their whenua (land) and bring these ideas to the discussion table with iwi in Aotearoa.\n\n\"Colonization was a slight in our whole economy, it wasn't who we were before and it doesn't have to be who we remain to be, at the bottom of every main statistic.\n\n\"It requires an intervention that is extreme, but it's also connected to whakapapa and no one can take that away from us.\"\n\nTe P\u0101ti M\u0101ori said the new parliament would assert M\u0101ori sovereignty as affirmed and protected in He Whakaputanga and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.\n\nIt would also be anchored in tikanga (M\u0101ori customs) and kawa (marae protocol) and target the livelihood of mokopuna (descendants).", "source": {"uri": "samoanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Samoa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_P\u0101ti_M\u0101ori", "type":

Some would argue this confirms that the policy of biculturalism is over, but I would question that. This is because multiculturalism and biculturalism operate in two totally different spheres.\n\nCanadian psychology researchers JW Berry and Rudolf Kalin defined three main characteristics of a multicultural society. The first is that a society values diversity and is open to the arrival of other cultures. New Zealand promotes itself as a tolerant society that is welcoming to cultures from all around the world.\n\nThe second characteristic is that immigrants are able to keep and express their cultural traditions as long as they don't violate the country's laws.\n\nIn New Zealand, there are some cultural practices that are banned such as smacking children and child marriages. We have even changed our laws to outlaw cultural practices that we had previously been unaware of, such as when female genital mutilation was made illegal in 1996. However, banning a few practices does not prevent groups from holding on to their significant cultural values, traditions and celebrations.\n\nThe third characteristic is that all cultural groups are able to participate in society in a fair and equitable way. If immigrants are expected to become indistinguishable from P\u0101keh\u0101 then the society is not multicultural. If they find employment difficult because they wear cultural or religious headdress, speak English with an accent, or have \"exotic\" names, it does not meet the standard to be a multicultural society.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations with multiculturalism. A multicultural New Zealand can be ignored by the majority. It is a lesser form of relationship that creates no change to the power structure. It allows other cultures to be here, but \"settler New Zealand\" values, laws, expectations and obligations don't need to change. In other words, immigrants can come here, but it is on the dominant culture's terms.\n\nBiculturalism on the other hand has a different emphasis. When the British handed over government in 1852 they did so to the settlers rather than to all those who lived in New Zealand. The settlers and their descendants ensured M\u0101ori were marginalised and that the country's institutions would be run from one British cultural perspective. New Zealand was to be a place where all government policy, all acts of Parliament and the delivery of services was to conform and be controlled based on British values.\n\nM\u0101ori had to adapt to a foreign language and a foreign culture with its foreign values imposed on the entire M\u0101ori population. There was little tolerance for the language, processes, values, expectations and obligations that were of value to M\u0101ori. (We still see some of that intolerance today).\n\nIn the 1980's New Zealand was almost entirely monocultural with M\u0101ori culture pushed to the margins, often only seen in public for sporting or entertainment purposes. M\u0101ori had complained about this monoculturalism for over 100 years and the fact that much of what was important to us was continuously ignored by the state.\n\nIn many ways, it was in 1984 with the launch of the Te M\u0101ori art exhibition at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art that made people sit up and see that New Zealand wasn't just a P\u0101keh\u0101 country, but that it was also a M\u0101ori country.\n\nBiculturalism had already been proposed as a way of incorporating the Crown's obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi and recognising that we have two distinct cultures, M\u0101ori culture, and a New Zealand culture that is based primarily on British values.\n\nBiculturalism as a policy sought to implement M\u0101ori language, values and practices into our laws, governmental practices and institutions. It required government departments to report on their responsiveness to M\u0101ori and sometimes included some power sharing in areas where M\u0101ori had a traditional interest.\n\nIn summary, multiculturalism is the welcoming of diversity, maintenance of their culture and being able to participate in society. In some ways it is misnamed and multiethnic may be a clearer description. Biculturalism brought M\u0101ori values, customs and processes into Government agencies and those it funds, and required Government departments to report on their responsiveness to Maori and to the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nWe can see that biculturalism and multiculturalism are not mutually exclusive terms. They can both occur and have different expectations and obligations for those in power.\n\nBiculturalism can still be a useful framework for our future.

Ko Te 'Ura I Te \u0100ta t\u014dku \u012bngoa. I am a mother of a married daughter and I have four grandchildren. I am a writer, educator, advisor, and community volunteer. I am a former policy analyst, public servant, educator of teacher trainees, and an advisor on bilingual/immersion education. My passion is te ao M\u0101ori and revitalising te reo M\u0101ori, within my wh\u0101nau and iwi. I am also passionate about the revitalisation of endangered indigenous languages. I started writing creative fiction as a teenager more as an outlet than anything else. It soon became like water I could'nt live without it. I have had a poem published in the Capital Times (Aotearoa). Alongside my unpublished writing I have written for diverse policy and community settings. I live in Porirua where Ng\u0101ti Toa Rang\u0101tira are m\u0101na whenua. Other places I have lived and drawn breath from are: Parihaka, Te Whanganui - \u0100 - T\u0101ra, Pukerua Bay, Whang\u0101nui, Cook Islands, Brunei, Singapore, and Australia.\n\nThe NZSA Kaituhi M\u0101ori Mentorship Programme was established in 2024 to foster and develop emerging writing talent around New Zealand with the support of established authors. The programme aims to support the amplification of M\u0101ori voices, M\u0101ori stories, and ultimately see greater publication and performance of these works.\n\nNZSA Kupu Kaitiaki Programme aims to provide new and emerging kaituhi with valuable feedback from a skilled Kupu Kaitiaki, for the refinement of a part of a manuscript written in te reo M\u0101ori.\n\nThese two programmes are new editions to The New Zealand Society of Authors Te Puni Kaituhi o Aotearoa's successful mentoring programmes for writers and is made possible with the support from Manat\u016b Taonga, the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage.\n\nNZSA's mentorship and assessment programmes have been running for 30 years and are invaluable in nurturing emerging new writers and helping them craft their

He asked for me to audition, and I got the part,\" she says.\n\n\"It was nerve-wracking being in a film and having to learn lines. But I got to work with people like Temuera Morrison, and they helped me. When I went to the premiere and saw my name up on the big screen, I felt pretty famous.\"\n\nHarawira-Nicholas shone at the international premiere in Sydney wearing a korowai (traditional M\u0101ori cloak) that had belonged to her mother, Hana Harawira.\n\nEven though her mother died of cancer when Harawira-Nicholas was six years old, the teenager says she felt her presence at the premiere.\n\n\"My mother is the reason why I'm so driven. She's been my inspiration. She encouraged me to achieve. By wearing her korowai at the premiere, it was like she was part of my experience, and she was looking after me. That's what I wanted,\" she says.\n\nEven so, she admits she's more comfortable playing rugby at home in Taneatua than posing on the red carpet.\n\n\"Going to all of these premieres is very surreal. Being glammed up and wearing heaps of makeup is just not me,\" Harawira-Nicholas says.\n\n\"But I'm here with my wh\u0101nau, and the friends I made on the film, so it's made it easier.\"\n\nHarawira-Nicholas says her mother encouraged her to be an overachiever. She's fulfilling her mother's wishes by succeeding on the oratory stage and on the sports field as well as the big screen.\n\n\"I play basketball. I made it into the Central North Island team. I play volleyball, and I play women's rugby for Ruatoki.\"\n\nIn September, Harawira-Nicholas will be representing the area of Mataatua at the prestigious annual Manu Korero Speech competitions, in the senior M\u0101ori section.\n\n\"I will proudly be representing my area at the nationals, and I can't wait.\"\n\nWith so many skills and talents, Hinerangi wants to continue acting but also aims to join the army and teach te reo M\u0101ori.\n\nShe wants to inspire other M\u0101ori youth to have dreams and reach their goals.\n\n\"I come from a very small village and I've had all these opportunities and made it to all of these big cities.

People have shared concerns about cuts to public services - from public housing to universal free prescriptions, half-price public transport to climate action. Here are some of the key issues you'd like to see addressed.\n\nCost of living and inequality on the rise\n\n\"The cuts made will ensure that people's lives are so much worse. In the Far North, the poor were promised \"huge tax relief\" which - with cuts to prescriptions and increases on rates and petrol - will make them even poorer\" - Catherine, Kerikeri\n\n\"It shows the government does not have a deep understanding of the range of people they are responsible for. The poor are hugely at risk. I am concerned about homelessness. I am concerned about the cost of renting\" - Del, New Plymouth\n\nPeople are struggling to meet their basic needs and can see that those around them are too. They are concerned National has no plan to lower the cost of living, with rents and unemployment expected to rise, and with thousands losing their jobs and income as a direct result of the National Government's choices. Those on the lowest incomes will benefit the least from this Budget, with thousands being left worse off and child poverty projected to increase.\n\n\"I'd rather the money went to prescriptions, kids' lunches or health. Anything but pointless token tax cuts that we pay for\" - Tony, Wairarapa\n\nMeanwhile, more evidence has come to light showing that the National Government knew how harmful cutting funding for the Ka Ora, Ka Ako healthy school lunch programme would be - and chose to whittle it down anyway. Some have been forced to turn healthy, hot meals into a pre-packaged snack. Concerns have also been raised about communities losing local jobs due to the programme being pared back, some of which are done by parents. With unemployment set to rise, this could be a double whammy for household budgets during a cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"My wife and I were hoping the National, Conservative Government with come through with the promised funding of so-called 'cancer' drugs. She has a malignancy which is only just controlled by us forking out $11,000 a month. This is monstrous and will eventually cripple us. Her life is worth vastly more than that\" - Geoffrey, Christchurch\n\nThe state of our health system has left people worried for the health of their families and loved ones. There is also a critical lack of funding for mental health services, which was not a priority in the Budget.\n\nNational promised to fund new cancer treatments and then chose not to - a move described by many as \"cruel\". Patients have been forced to spend thousands each month to pay for their own treatments out of pocket. It's time for the National Government to fulfil its promise to those who are most in need.\n\n\"Are prosperous landlords more worthy than people suffering from cancer?\" - Murray, Alexandra\n\nLabour MPs have been continuing to advocate around the country for meaningful investment in health services, buildings and staffing, so New Zealanders get the levels of healthcare they need.\n\n\"It's terrible, my daughter is trying to save to buy a home, so she now won't get the First Home Buyer Grant. Christopher Luxon said that it is only $5000, as if that is peanuts, but to normal people that is a lot of money. For my daughter more than another year of saving. The tax cuts won't make up for that\" - Sandra, Timaru\n\nNational's abrupt axing of the First Home Grant has left many in the lurch, with some having to save for months longer than planned to make up for it. National also cut more than $1.5 billion of support for public housing, including M\u0101ori housing development and youth transitional housing. Meanwhile, National has gifted $2.9 billion to landlords through changes to interest deductibility.\n\n\"The housing crisis affects so many, leaving people like us uncertain about our future\" - Rosa, Wellington\n\nThere's now $1.5 billion less for building and maintaining public houses, which will slow the progress we've made as a country to fix the housing crisis. The Government has cut $435 million from the K\u0101inga Ora house build programme and over $1 billion from the maintenance fund. They've also scrapped parts of the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme, which will lead to pressure on household bills as well as the health system. In Government, Labour helped retrofit more than 120,000 homes to make sure they were warmer, drier and more energy efficient. It means fewer people get sick and costs of heating come down.\n\n\"Very, very disappointed in what National has done since coming into power. Destructive moves for our environment and failing to provide appropriate protection for us as individuals in view of climate change\" - Heather, Dunedin\n\nPeople have been shocked to see action and research on climate change slashed, which leaves us all vulnerable. The Climate Emergency Response Fund has been cut back, with nothing to replace it. Hundreds of people are set to lose their jobs at the Ministry for the Environment, which leads work on reducing New Zealand's emissions, adapting to a changing climate, dealing with waste, and resource management policy.\n\n\"I think it's going to take our country back so many years, it just doesn't seem to care for our people or our environment\" - Bronwyn, Northland\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of people have written and marched to oppose National's incredibly unpopular Fast Track legislation, which could put our native species and their habitats at risk. Around the country, communities are worried about how damaging this reckless legislation will be for our precious environment and future generations.\n\n\"The Budget 2024 ignored the wellbeing of M\u0101ori, put profit over people\" - Annie, Lower Hutt\n\nWe've heard strong concerns that M\u0101ori have been ignored in the Budget and will be disproportionately impacted by the Government's reckless decisions. M\u0101ori Development has received zero funding for core services along with no new initiatives for M\u0101ori communities.\n\n\"My biggest concern is the future for my mokopuna regarding climate change and, as they are M\u0101ori I fear for the loss of their language, te reo M\u0101ori\" - Adair, Masterton\n\nAlongside the Government winding back Te Reo M\u0101ori initiatives and their removal of Te Aka Whai Ora, the M\u0101ori Health Authority, they've also slashed support for M\u0101ori housing development and halved funding for Matariki celebrations.\n\nLabour will continue listening to what matters most to New Zealanders and holding the Government to account for the reckless decisions they've made in Budget 24.\n\nYou can share how the Budget affects your community

A Time of Celebration ... A Time in the Future\n\nNgati Poneke M\u0101ori Arts proudly announces the 2024 Matariki observances at Pipitea Marae, the esteemed origin of the Matariki Festival since 1995. Whether you're a long-time resident or a visitor to Wellington, we warmly invite you to join us in our vibrant festivities, blending traditional M\u0101ori rituals with contemporary events.\n\nThe idea of staging this festival arose from our concern about the absence of a cultural framework in the Wellington region that could confirm our M\u0101ori worldview and thrive in a contemporary environment. Long before Te Papa and the Wellington City Council embraced the occasion, Ngati Poneke M\u0101ori Arts has been at the forefront, inviting the community to experience Matariki in a traditional Marae setting.\n\nOur festival stands as a testament to our cultural identity and allows our voice to resonate authentically, asserting our ownership over our cultural territory.\n\nThis year's events include an Art exhibition featuring renowned M\u0101ori artists Diane Prince, W\u012b Taepa, and emerging talents from Ngati Poneke M\u0101ori Arts.\n\nThe theme for this year, Mana Wahine, highlights the strength and contributions of Wahine to Ngati Poneke M\u0101ori Arts. Key highlights of the week include Hine Matapaki - a panel discussion with Wahine M\u0101ori MPs, and Kamira Mullen's 'Hide No More' poetry book launch.\n\nHighlights: Kapa Haka performance, educational workshops, cultural exhibitions.\n\nExperience Matariki where it belongs - at the Marae.\n\nPipitea Marae - getting here\n\nLocated on 55 Thorndon Quay, Wellington - Pipitea Marea is a short 4 minute walk from the Wellington Railway Station (opposite Capital Gateway Shopping Mall). There is limited parking nearby.\n\nAccess point: Look for the Manu Aute (kites) to guide you through the open gates, walk towards the whare and enter through the door on the right.", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matariki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matariki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorndon,_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thorndon, New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Papa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Te Papa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_City_Council", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellington City Council"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington City Council"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellington Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipitea,_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipitea, New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_(New_Zealand_electorate)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mana (New Zealand electorate)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_electorates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori electorates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharenui", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wharenui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haka"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Digital", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Digital", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Reviews", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Magazines_and_E-zines/Magazines", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Magazines and E-zines/Magazines", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662745", "eventUri": "eng-9662745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He was sentenced to 16 months in prison. He said he served two-and-a-half months inside, and five-and-a-half months on home detention, then eight months of post-detention conditions.\n\nEight years on, the 29-year-old works as a steel fabricator.\n\nHe told the Bay of Plenty Times he had thought about standing for Tauranga City Council for a long time and always \"put it off\", but his recent work on city projects such as the Tunks Reserve upgrade crystalised the idea.\n\n\"I considered not nominating because my age and background from my past might hold me back in that regard. But I think that it's important to acknowledge that part of moving forward is confronting your past and confronting what you've done and owning up and being accountable.\"\n\nHis offending involved ordering 10g of ecstasy powder online to be sent to his house. He received an envelope from the Netherlands containing the drug, which he consumed.\n\nHe accessed the same website twice more for other orders but Customs intercepted these.\n\nAt the time, Hillis told police he got the idea to import the drugs from watching a television programme, and said he deeply regretted his actions.\n\nHillis had two prior drug convictions, including selling cannabis, but his lawyer argued at the time the ecstasy was for personal use.\n\nLooking back at his 22-year-old self, Hillis said he was in a dark place and looking for something to help him have a \"good time\".\n\n\"At the time it really didn't feel criminal,\" he said.\n\n\"It just felt like I was punching keys behind a computer and then it wasn't until the police were knocking at my door and had raided my house and had come to arrest me that I, really realised the gravity of what I was doing ... [it was] very sobering.\"\n\nTime in prison forced Hillis to reevaluate his life, and his judgment of people.\n\n\"I haven't lived a rough criminal life or anything like that. For me, this whole experience was so frightening,\" he said.\n\nHe said he got through it with the support of his family and experiences of \"humble, kind care from people\", including in prison.\n\n\"I'm here now, so much more of a better person for it.\n\n\"Once you get to the bottom, there's no way to look but up and that's the truth.\"\n\nHillis hoped to use his campaign to advocate for change \"and doing better with your life and not holding yourself back by limitations of the past\".\n\nHe said he was \"never going back\" to prison.\n\n\"I know that I've learned from my mistakes. I'm here to be transparent about what I've done and own what I've done and move on. And Tauranga, some may say, also needs to move on ... we're in quite a transformative time.\"\n\nHillis said he had not attended council meetings but regularly watched online.\n\nTransport infrastructure and housing were his biggest concerns.\n\n\"This is my t\u016brangawaewae. I just want to see the city thrive again, like it did when I was young.\"\n\nOn how he would advocate for M\u0101ori if elected as Tauranga's first M\u0101ori ward councillor, Hillis said: \"I think that good results for all are best results for M\u0101ori\".\n\n\"So lowered rates, easier to get into homes, and stuff like that because gentrification remains an issue, especially as we look at intensification. How can we ensure that we're socially responsible with our housing, too, in order to not push people out of their turangawaewae, their rohe (territory of tribes)?\"\n\nHillis believed in kotahitanga (unity) and intended to join Te Pati M\u0101ori protest march on Hewletts Rd last month but became stuck in traffic. Despite supporting the cause, he felt there could be better, less disruptive, ways to communicate a message. He hoped to exemplify this by becoming a councillor.\n\nHe said M\u0101ori wards were beneficial as they brought a M\u0101ori voice for things pertaining to mana whenua and tikanga.\n\n\"The best outcomes for M\u0101ori are best outcomes for all of us - much in the same [way] that best outcomes for all are best outcomes for M\u0101ori because [there are an estimated] 16,000 people on the M\u0101ori roll, that means there are 16,000 people, at minimum, here that identify as M\u0101ori and their views should be considered too.\"\n\nThe coalition Government plans to reinstate legislation allowing 5 per cent of voters to reverse council decisions allowing for M\u0101ori wards passed its first reading. If successful, the reversal would not impact Tauranga City until 2028, when the next elections will be held.\n\nHillis said he was not sure if the ward would survive long-term given \"the usual sentiment of Tauranga\" but hoped that was changing.\n\nAsked to elaborate, Hillis said he believed the city had previously been \"pretty conservative\" towards \"all things, M\u0101ori, all things M\u0101oritanga\".\n\n\"It's been a hard sell.\"\n\nHillis said people needed to vote, even if it was not for him, describing the other two ward candidates as \"great people\".\n\n\"I would be happy for either of them to win, but I want people to feel empowered by the idea that this is their voice and that's done at the ballot.\"\n\nOn his most recent blog, Hillis offered a whakatauki (M\u0101ori proverb) that perhaps summed up his situation best.\n\nE more te p\u0101tiki e hoki ki t\u014dna puehu -

Credits: Video - Newshub, Image - RNZ\n\nBy Aroha Awarau of RNZ\n\nAt just 16, Hinerangi Harawira-Nicholas is already making a name for herself in public speaking, sport and acting.\n\nLast week the T\u016bhoe teenager made her big screen debut in new M\u0101ori-led film Ka Whawhai Tonu, alongside Temuera Morrison, Cliff Curtis and Miriama Smith.\n\nKa Whawhai Tonu is a te reo M\u0101ori film inspired by the battle of \u014cr\u0101kau, a conflict that took place in the Waikato region 160 years ago during a nationwide confiscation of M\u0101ori land.\n\nHarawira-Nicholas nabbed one of the main roles in the film thanks to her fluency in M\u0101ori and her wh\u0101nau connection to the film's director, Mike Jonathan.\n\n\"Mike is friends with my wh\u0101nau and he knew that I fit the description of the role. He asked for me to audition, and I got the part,\" she says.\n\n\"It was nerve-wracking being in a film and having to learn lines. But I got to work with people like Temuera Morrison, and they helped me. When I went to the premiere and saw my name up on the big screen, I felt pretty famous.\"\n\nHarawira-Nicholas shone at the international premiere in Sydney wearing a korowai (traditional M\u0101ori cloak) that had belonged to her mother, Hana Harawira.\n\nEven though her mother died of cancer when Harawira-Nicholas was six years old, the teenager says she felt her presence at the premiere.\n\n\"My mother is the reason why I'm so driven. She's been my inspiration. She encouraged me to achieve. By wearing her korowai at the premiere, it was like she was part of my experience, and she was looking after me. That's what I wanted,\" she says.\n\nEven so, she admits she's more comfortable playing rugby at home in Taneatua than posing on the red carpet.\n\n\"Going to all of these premieres is very surreal. Being glammed up and wearing heaps of makeup is just not me,\" Harawira-Nicholas says.\n\n\"But I'm here with my wh\u0101nau, and the friends I made on the film, so it's made it easier.\"\n\nHarawira-Nicholas says her mother encouraged her to be an overachiever. She's fulfilling her mother's wishes by succeeding on the oratory stage and on the sports field as well as the big screen.\n\n\"I play basketball. I made it into the Central North Island team. I play volleyball, and I play women's rugby for Ruatoki.\"\n\nIn September, Harawira-Nicholas will be representing the area of Mataatua at the prestigious annual Manu Korero Speech competitions, in the senior M\u0101ori section.\n\n\"I will proudly be representing my area at the nationals, and I can't wait.\"\n\nWith so many skills and talents, Hinerangi wants to continue acting but also aims to join the army and teach te reo M\u0101ori.\n\nShe wants to inspire other M\u0101ori youth to have dreams and reach their goals.\n\n\"I come from a very small village and I've had all these opportunities and made it to all of these big cities. If you work hard, and put your mind and heart into your mahi, then anyone can do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temuera_Morrison", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temuera Morrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh\u0101nau", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wh\u0101nau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikato", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waikato"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waikato"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newshub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newshub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_traditional_textiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori traditional textiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Curtis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cliff Curtis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng\u0101i_T\u016bhoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Waikato", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasion of the Waikato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriama_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miriama Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u0101neatua", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T\u0101neatua"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101taatua", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101taatua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2024/06/why-hinerangi-harawira-nicholas-16-is-about-to-become-matariki-s-biggest-star/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1718922914847/rnz-lucy-corry-Hinerangi%2BHarawira-Nicholas-210624-1120x640.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662745", "eventUri": "eng-9662745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

It is in everyone's interest for these groups to be better paid, with better opportunities to progress in work: our economic prosperity, sorely tested at present, depends on it.\n\nAnd yet, New Zealand is making very slow progress towards pay parity for M\u0101ori and Pacific people.\n\nStats NZ reports the average annual household-equivalised disposable income, before housing costs, by ethnicity for the year ending June 2023 was $60,790 for European, $50,238 for M\u0101ori and $47,797 for Pacific peoples.\n\nTo put it another way: in 2021, for every $1 a P\u0101keh\u0101 man earned, a P\u0101keh\u0101 woman earned $0.89, an Asian man earned $0.86, a M\u0101ori man earned $0.86, an Asian woman earned $0.83, a Pacific man earned $0.81, a M\u0101ori woman earned $0.81, and a Pacific woman earned $0.75.\n\nWe know what the problem is at a national scale. To fix it, we need to understand the problem at the level of individual employers. This starts with gathering, and reporting, data.\n\nActing Minister for Women Louise Upston, who announced the voluntary reporting regime last week, has since claimed: \"Due to data collection issues, measuring ethnic pay gaps has proven difficult in overseas jurisdictions\".\n\nUpston may not be aware that South Africa, Ontario, California and Scotland have all managed to implement ethnic pay gap reporting. Luckily for New Zealand, measuring ethnic pay gaps in our jurisdiction has recently become a whole lot easier. The Good Employer Matrix, launched in April, is the first tool of its kind to support employers in the private sector to calculate ethnic pay gaps in their businesses.\n\nThe framework, developed over three years by the Uptempo team at Auckland Council, in consultation with organisations such as Kiwibank and Woolworths, as well as aiga (families) in south and west Auckland, also helps employers large and small assess how they're supporting M\u0101ori and Pacific staff to progress in the workforce - the most effective means to solve pay gaps faced by these communities - and gives them the tools to make this a reality.\n\nNow, there's no excuse for New Zealand businesses to withhold pay gap information or delay taking steps to remedy it. Indeed, according to the Mind the Gap registry, ANZ, KPMG, PwC and a number of other organisations already report their gender-ethnic pay gaps, while the registry has seen a 40 percent increase in the number of companies measuring and reporting on ethnic pay gaps over the last year. Since April, we ourselves have been approached by some of the country's biggest businesses who want to understand how to be better employers for their M\u0101ori and Pacific staff.\n\nSmart businesses understand that it's better to be early adopters and gain this kind of reputation now. Businesses who value diversity attract lucrative partners, lure top talent, and keep loyal customers and clients. With or without mandatory pay gap reporting, employers can act now to be part of the solution.", "source": {"uri": "newsroom.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsroom"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u0101keh\u0101", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "P\u0101keh\u0101"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_New_Zealanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian New Zealanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Commission_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Upston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louise Upston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistics New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender pay gap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasifika_New_Zealanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasifika New Zealanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ontario, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwibank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiwibank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Council", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auckland Council"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Ethnic_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Ethnic Studies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Discrimination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Discrimination", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/newspack-newsroomconz.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sucQ1OF3885uV1SMkqY5-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1028&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662745", "eventUri": "eng-9662745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

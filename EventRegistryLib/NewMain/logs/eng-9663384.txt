For the first time ever, the U.S. Swimming Trials will take place inside an NFL stadium, as Lucas Oil Stadium (home of the Indianapolis Colts) is converted into the world's largest natatorium for nine days of fierce competition. Full streaming and TV coverage details are now available here as well as on the NBCOlympics.com schedule page.\n\nKatie Ledecky leads the list of swimming stars looking to lock up a spot on the Olympic team, as she vies for a fourth Games appearance to further her already legendary career. Caeleb Dressel will also be in the spotlight, and is among the biggest wildcards, as the seven-time gold medalist recently returned to swimming after unexpectedly stepping away from the sport in 2022. Other Olympic veterans like Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy hope to position themselves to make more history in the pool this summer, while a highly-touted next generation of stars begins to take shape around the Gen-Z core of Kate Douglass, Regan Smith and Jack Alexy.\n\nWith so many elite Americans vying for just two Olympic places per individual event, it's no wonder why many U.S. swimmers through the years have cited Trials as more nerve-racking than the Olympic Games themselves. At the Olympics, third place gets you a medal. At Trials, it gets you a broken heart and a trip home.\n\nAll finals sessions will air live on NBC in primetime starting on Saturday, June 15, with coverage also streaming on Peacock, NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com and the NBC/NBC Sports apps.

Athletes plan to give it their all in the pool as they compete for an opportunity to represent Team USA in Paris, whether it be in the men's 100 freestyle or the women's 1500 freestyle.\n\nWith athletes like Kate Douglass and Caeleb Dressel leading the way, the environment is set for a spectacular competition and a fulfillment of Olympic ambitions for many. However, the 21-year-old icon Jack Alexy topped the scoreboard with stunning moves.\n\nMEN'S 200 BUTTERFLY - PRELIMS\n\nWorld Record: 1:50.34, Kristof Milak (HUN) - 2022 World Championships\n\nAmerican Record: 1:51.51, Michael Phelps - 2009 World Championships\n\nU.S. Open Record: 1:52.20, Michael Phelps (USA) - 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials\n\nWorld Junior Record: 1:53.79, Kristof Milak (hun) - 2017 European Junior Championships\n\n2021 U.S. Olympic Trials Champion: 1:55.06, Zach Harting\n\n2024 Olympic Qualifying Time: 1:55.78\n\nIn the men's 200 fly penultimate heat, Mason Laur of Florida made waves with a personal best time of 1:55.09. With a swim that was almost six-tenths quicker than his earlier best, he secured the top berth going into the semifinals.\n\nDare Rose for Cal got off to a fast start, leading the heat with an opening 100 of 53.82. Keeping up his speed, he finished in 1:55.94, only 0.01 seconds short of his personal best from the previous summer. As one of the three swimmers to finish the session under 1:56, he finished third overall with his performance.\n\nInsights:\n\nLuca Urlando of DART Swimming, who has been recovering from shoulder problems over the previous two years, looked powerful and fluid in the final heat. With a time of 1:55.52, he won the heat and qualified for the semifinals in second place. His season-best time of 1:55.63, which he posted at the Pro Swim Stop in San Antonio, was marginally better this time.\n\nThe men's 100-free final heat was illuminated by rockets as Jack Alexy triumphed, surpassing Caeleb Dressel's eagerly awaited meet debut. With a time of 47.08, silver medallist Alexy from the 2023 Worlds made an amazing performance. His splits, which were the fastest in the race (22.44 for the first 50 and 24.64 for the second), shattered Dressel and Ryan Held's previous U.S. Open Record of 47.39.\n\nWith this amazing swim, Alexy beat his previous best of 47.31 from last year's World Championship final and shot himself into a tie for eighth place all-time in the race, matching Kyle Chalmers.\n\nDressel also displayed encouraging form, even if Alexy's performance was remarkable. He swam in 47.82, his quickest time in two years, to finish in the third slot and move on to the semifinals. Dressel's swim indicates a solid comeback to competition, despite being eclipsed.\n\nInsights:\n\nChris Guiliano, a Notre Dame product, continued his Olympic qualification from yesterday night's 200 free by swimming an incredible second-to-last heat in which he dropped over three tenths off his personal best time of 47.65 to finish second and go to the semifinals.\n\nWorld Record: 15:20.48, Katie Ledecky (USA) - 2018 Pro Swim Series, Indianapolis\n\nAmerican Record: 15:20.48, Katie Ledecky (USA) - 2018 Pro Swim Series, Indianapolis\n\nU.S. Open Record: 15:20.48, Katie Ledecky (USA) - 2018 Pro Swim Series, Indianapolis\n\nWorld Junior Record:15:28.36, Katie Ledecky (USA)\n\n2021 U.S. Olympic Trials Champion: Katie Ledecky, 15:40.50\n\n2024 Olympic Qualifying Time ('A' Cut): 16:09.09\n\nThe women's 1500 freestyle heats included a distance swimming masterpiece from Katie Ledecky. With a record of 15:39.73, the reigning Olympian easily set the fastest time by more than 30 seconds. Not only is this swim the 23rd fastest in history, but it's also the 22nd fastest of her remarkable career.\n\nAnd with that, the 2024 US Olympic Swim Trials' fourth day of competition is finished!

In some events, such as the women's and men's 10,000 meters, athletes who don't have the Trials standards have been allowed into the meet to fill out the fields. Consider performances that got someone entry into the Olympic Trials to be at least national-class marks.\n\nThese Olympic Trials standards, which were set by USA Track and Field (USATF), are separate from -- and easier than -- the automatic Olympic qualifying standards. Set by World Athletics, track and field's international governing body, the Olympic qualifying standards generally require a world-class performance.\n\nIn many events at the Trials, several of the top qualifiers have the Olympic standard. For example, 12 entrants in the men's 200 meters have the Olympic standard of 20.16. And it's conceivable that someone currently lacking the standard could run it at the Trials. In a deep event like that, team selection is usually straightforward -- the top three at the Trials are almost certainly your U.S. Olympians in that event.\n\nThings get trickier when fewer Trials entrants have the Olympic standard. Consider the men's 10,000 meters. The automatic qualifying time standard for the Olympic Trials is 27:45. Only eight men met that standard, so USATF filled the remaining 16 spots with the fastest non-auto-qualifiers. (Isai Rodriguez snagged the final spot with his time of 28:15.) But of the 24 men in the field, only three -- Grant Fisher, Nico Young, and Woody Kincaid -- have the automatic Olympic qualifying standard of 27:00. Given that only five U.S. men have ever broken 27:00, it's highly unlikely that anyone in the Trials race who doesn't have the Olympic standard will run that time in Eugene.\n\nThe upshot: Rodriguez or someone else lacking the Olympic standard could run the race of his life and place in the top three, but would probably not be named to the Olympic team.\n\nThis scenario has played out at previous Trials. In 2012, the first three finishers in the women's 10,000 were Amy Hastings (now Cragg), Natosha Rogers, and Shalane Flanagan. Hastings had the Olympic standard, so she made the team. Rogers didn't, and therefore didn't make the team. Flanagan had the standard, but she had already made the team in the marathon and opted not to double at the Olympics. Only two other women in the field, Lisa Uhl and Janet Cherobon-Bawcom, had the Olympic standard. They placed fourth and eighth, respectively, but they literally could have walked and been the final two finishers, and they still would have made the team.\n\nThat was an extreme example, but it illustrates a key point: USATF's policy is to send as full a team as possible. If the top three finishers don't have the Olympic standard, then USATF goes down the order of Trials finishers until it reaches three athletes with the Olympic standard.\n\nAgain, there's precedent for athletes other than those in the top three to make the Olympic team. But while it may have seemed strange in 2012 for the fourth and eighth finishers in the women's 10,000 to take a victory lap, at least it was known immediately that Uhl and Cherobon-Bawcom were Olympians. In 2024, it's possible that we might not know the full Olympic team until a week after the Trials.\n\nThat's because, in addition to automatic qualifying standards, World Athletics also grants Olympic qualifiers to athletes with a high enough score in its world rankings. For example, when this article was published, Paul Chelimo's ranking in the 10,000 counted as an Olympic qualifier. So if he were to place in the top three in that event in the Trials, he would most likely make the Olympic team, because USATF considers a high enough world ranking as good as the Olympic auto qualifying time.\n\nWe say \"most likely\" instead of \"certainly\" about Chelimo for good reason. There are two aspects of the rankings that could frustrate fans looking for immediate gratification from Trials results -- the rankings are fluid, and the final rankings won't be posted until July 7.\n\nThe rankings are fluid in that the Olympic qualifying period is open until June 30 (which happens to be the final day of the Trials). Performances at the Trials and other meets could move athletes into or out of contention for the limited number of Olympic spots available in a given event. It's conceivable, but not likely, that Chelimo could place in the top three at the Trials but be surpassed in the world rankings by enough runners from other countries that, as of June 30, his ranking no longer counts as an Olympic qualifier.\n\nWhat's the significance of July 7, given that the Olympic qualifying period ends on June 30? World Athletics has built a few steps into the rankings process. On July 2, it will confirm the list of athletes whose ranking gets them an Olympic qualifier. Those athletes have until July 4 to decline the Olympic spot. Only after that process will World Athletics publish the final rankings on July 7. In our Paul Chelimo example, USATF would include him on the initial team roster, but -- clich\u00e9 alert -- out of an abundance of caution, wouldn't officially deem him a 2024 Olympian until the final rankings are published on July 7.\n\nAt the Trials, rankings are most likely to matter in the women's 10,000. The only entrant with the automatic qualifying time of 30:40 is Weini Kelati. (American record-holder Alicia Monson also has the time standard but is recovering from surgery.) As of this writing, only two other entrants, Katie Izzo and Fiona O'Keeffe, have a ranking high enough to count as an Olympic qualifier. Marathon Trials champ O'Keeffe won't run the 10,000 at the Trials. Izzo's world ranking stems from cross country performances; her Trials qualifying time of 32:22 is the 25th fastest in the 26-woman field. Meanwhile, runners much faster than Izzo, such as NCAA champ Parker Valby, could move way up in the world rankings with a fast enough top-three place at the Trials. (The rankings allot points based on time and finishing place in a given race. An athlete's ranking is the average of their two best scores.)\n\nOther events where world rankings could play a large role include the men's 1500 (only four entrants have the Olympic time standard) and the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase (only two entrants have the time standard).\n\nAs if all of this scenario mapping isn't enough, there's the matter of top runners doubling at the Trials but potentially turning down an Olympic spot. As a hypothetical, consider Elle St. Pierre. She has the fastest U.S. times this year at 1500 and 5,000 meters. Say she first makes the 5,000 team on June 24 and also finishes in the top three in the 1500 on June 30. If she and her coach weren't sure whether to attempt that same double at the Olympics, she could wait a day before informing USATF of her decision. (Athletes will be asked their intentions in post-race processing, but they aren't required to give a definitive answer at that time.)\n\nWhat to make of all this? First, remember that in most events, the top three at the Trials will be Olympians. Second, trust that in the murkier events, following our real-time, daily coverage of the Trials will keep you as informed as possible. And third, it's fine to just sit back and enjoy great racing for its own sake.", "source": {"uri": "runnersworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Runner's World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Track_&_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Track & Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "10,000 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Cherobon-Bawcom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Janet Cherobon-Bawcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalane_Flanagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shalane Flanagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natosha_Rogers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natosha Rogers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Kincaid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woody Kincaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Cragg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Cragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grant Fisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Chelimo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Chelimo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weini_Kelati", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weini Kelati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Monson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alicia Monson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeplechase_(athletics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steeplechase (athletics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5000 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_country_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross country running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elle-purrier-st-pierre-first-cory-mcgee-second-and-heather-news-photo-1718809852.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0815xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663384", "eventUri": "eng-9663384", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "dateEnd": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 234, "textEnd": 244}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 4750, "textEnd": 4756, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 4834, "textEnd": 4841, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 5455, "textEnd": 5461}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 5572, "textEnd": 5578}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-24", "textStart": 7342, "textEnd": 7349}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Newland proposed holding the Trials in Eugene over 11 days to mirror the competition schedule of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.\n\n\"Properly staged,\" Newland said, \"a track meet is a thing of beauty.\"\n\nThere was audible laughter from the Los Angeles delegation when Newland laid out the Oregon Track Club's plan.\n\nThe USOC by a vote of 39-6 awarded Eugene the 1972 Trials. Those Trials were so successful that Eugene was later awarded the 1976 and 1980 Trials as well.\n\nIt was the last time American track and field failed to take the persuasive powers of Eugene and its allies seriously.\n\nAn unprecedented fifth consecutive U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene open Friday at Hayward Field, extending and highlighting Tracktown's grip on the sport that Newland and Rau could not have envisioned that day in New York more than a half-century ago.\n\nOf this decade's eight major U.S. championships - the Olympic Trials, the U.S. and NCAA championships - seven have been hosted by Eugene. Tracktown has been home to nine of the last 11 NCAA Championships and is scheduled to host the next three NCAAs as well. Or consider that in the Olympic Trials' 104-year history, no other city has hosted the event more than three consecutive times and no location has held more than two straight Trials since 1928.\n\nThe driving force behind Eugene's hold on the sport is Tracktown USA, a tax-exempt, non-profit that has reported more than $140 million in revenue since it was founded in 2013 to become along with one of its chief benefactors, Nike, perhaps the most powerful entity in American track and field.\n\nTracktown USA describes its mission as elevating \"the sport of track and field in the mind of the American public and to enhance the profile of the Eugene-Springfield region and the entire State of Oregon as 'Track Town USA' - the premier destination for track and field meets in North America.\"\n\nBut Tracktown USA's reach is global. The organization has secured for Eugene the 2022 World Championships, last year's Diamond League final, the 2014 and 2026 World Under-20 Championships and the 2016 World Indoor Championships for Portland. The group is also behind the annual Prefontaine Classic, the only U.S. stop on the Diamond League circuit and regularly rated as the world's premier one day meet.\n\n\"The general philosophy is we believe we've gotten pretty good at the delivery of events but we have an amazing stadium here that's specifically designed for the future of hosting great events,\" said Michael Reilly, the former Stanford distance runner who is now Tracktown USA's CEO. \"It was designed to be a theater for track and field, that was the intention behind that. Well if we've got this amazing world class theater here, we really want to see great events coming. We're of the mind, the belief, that events can be a great opportunity. One of the great pieces of growing of the sport of track and field is if you've got an opportunity to bring people in to connect them directly with the athletes and send them home with a smile on their face, that's a tremendous part of growing fandom for track and field.\"\n\nTracktown USA, bolstered by more than $40 million in government support between 2013 and 2022, according to Internal Revenue Service filings and other financial documents, has been so good at fulfilling that mission, that meet promoters and local sports commissions in major markets and in traditional track and field destinations said not only can they no longer compete with Eugene to land top U.S. meets like the Olympic Trials, but in some cases, they have simply stopped trying.\n\n\"Eugene is pretty tough to compete with these days,\" said Greg Edwards, president and CEO of the Des Moines Area Sports Commission. \"The Olympic Trials is a huge undertaking both cost-wise and in terms of sponsorship. And Eugene is so powerful, we feel like we can't compete with them. So (bidding) becomes a, 'Why are we spinning our wheels kind of thing?'\"\n\nEugene's landing the 2024 Trials is the latest and perhaps most glaring example of how Tracktown USA has scared off the competition.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Trials are the world's second most important track meet in every Olympic season and the most valuable property in the American sport; track and field's ultimate reality show played out in prime time over the course of 10 dream fulfilling and heartbreaking days with a sense of drama that often exceeds that of the Games themselves.\n\nThe Olympic Trials not only have the ability to shape the lives of their participants but they also impact the communities that host them. The 2016 Trials, the last Trials held before the coronavirus pandemic, had a $37 million economic impact on Eugene and Lane County.\n\nTo potential bid cities, hosting the 2024 Trials should have appeared especially attractive. The meet will feature the greatest collection of American track and field athletes since the trailblazing 1968 Olympic team or maybe ever. The field includes world record-shattering talents like shot putter Ryan Crouser and hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Noah Lyles and Sha'Carri Richardson, the world's fastest fashion statements, and the deepest and most talented group of U.S. middle and long distance runners since Jim Ryun, Marty Liquori, Steve Prefontaine, Dave Wottle, Frank Shorter in the era of the early 70s.\n\n\"It is the golden generation,\" said Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, track's international governing body and a two-time Olympic champion.\n\nYet Eugene was awarded the Olympic Trials by USA Track & Field, the sport's national governing body, last year after no other city chose to bid for the event including three cities that have either hosted the U.S. or NCAA Championships since 2008 - Sacramento, which also held the 2000 and 2004 Trials, Des Moines and Austin - as well as New York City and Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, which was awarded the 2020 Trials in 2017 only to have them stripped away from the school by USATF and the USOPC less than a year later.\n\nIn other words, Eugene, for all its history and investment and commitment to track, won the 2024 Olympic Trials by default.\n\n\"We've talked to a lot of meet directors and they all say the same thing: that you can't compete with Eugene,\" said Brian Yokoyama, Mt. SAC's director of athletic events.\n\nYokoyama and Edwards' comments were echoed in interviews with meet directors, local sports commission officials, Olympic and World championship medalists and world record-holders, top professional and college coaches, and agents from which a growing consensus emerged that even officials and promoters in major markets like Los Angeles and New York have given up trying to compete with Eugene for the top American meets like Olympic Trials, U.S. and NCAA championships.\n\nIRS filings, other financial records, legislative documents, university and marketing studies, and interviews reveal just how wide the resource gap is between Tracktown USA and the rest of the sport.\n\nTracktown USA began 2022, the most recent year for which IRS filings are available, with $55 million in assets, or 100 times more than the Des Moines Area Sports Commission's $555,395 in assets. Between 2016 and 2021, Tracktown USA spent $322,500 on lobbying, more than the $300,000 Mt. SAC spent in total on bidding for and then organizing the 2020 Trials.\n\n\"How can I compete with that?\" Yokoyama asked. \"I can't.\"\n\nThat other cities are reluctant to bid for major championships, athletes, coaches, meet directors and agents said, has further escalated concerns that U.S. track and field's reliance on Eugene has hindered the sport's growth at the very time when American track has a cast athletes with the potential to transcend the sport and attract a broader audience just as Michael Phelps and Simone Biles did for swimming and gymnastics.\n\nIn fact, athletes and coaches insist, that Eugene hotels, restaurants and businesses' well founded history of price gouging and the expense of traveling to the city has driven away fans and made it increasingly difficult for athletes who don't have large shoe contracts to afford to travel to Eugene in hopes of making an Olympic or World Championships team.\n\n\"You'd hate to see track turn into one of those sports where it's pay to play,\" said sprinter Gabby Thomas, a two-Olympic medalist and world champion in the 4\u00d7100-meter relay. \"You want the best people in the country to have the opportunity to make the team not just because they have the support and the financial background.\"\n\nThomas is one of a growing number of Olympic and Worlds medalists who are advocating that major U.S. championships be held away from Eugene.\n\n\"I think we would definitely all love to see that,\" said Thomas, an Olympic bronze and Worlds silver medalist at 200 meters. \"I definitely think it's time. You see how easy it is to get to other cities. Eugene is really hard to get to and it's not feasible for a lot of people to try and make their dream happen.\n\n\"But also just for interest (in track). The public wants to see the Olympic Trials. They want to know when it's happening, where it's happening and they want to be able to buy tickets if you put it in a city people will be excited to go to.\n\n\"For people who just want to go and support (the sport). If I don't want to go to Eugene, why would anyone want to?\"\n\nAlthough LA 28 is expected to bid to host the 2028 Trials at the Coliseum as a test run for the Olympic Games, many in sport see the possibility of a Los Angeles Trials as a brief aberration more than a change in direction. An LA 28 spokesperson said it is premature to talk about a bid for the 2028 Trials but privately LA 28 officials are confident in landing the event.\n\nEven after 2028, athletes, coaches and meet directors, expect all roads will lead back to Eugene.\n\nAfter Los Angeles in 2028, Yokoyama said, the Olympic Trials \"are never going to be in a major market again.\"\n\nReilly said the concerns and criticism are misinformed and misguided.\n\n\"Well we all have to acknowledge that not everything is in Eugene,\" he said. \"There's an entire track season that doesn't take place on the West Coast. There is the LA Grand Prix that USA Track and Field has started. There's a New York Grand Prix.\n\n\"I don't know that it's fair to say that everything is taking place in Eugene. I think there's truth in the bigger statement that growing the sport of track and field, it's a huge task that involves a lot more than hosting events. I believe we're doing our part with the events we bring here and how we host them.\"\n\nBut Eugene has hosted nearly two-thirds (62.5 percent) of the Olympic Trials, U.S. and NCAA championships since 2008, 72.2 percent of those meets in the last decade, or more than twice as many times as all the other host cities combined.\n\nThe University of Oregon, having already secured the next three NCAA meets, is also bidding to host the collegiate championships in 2028 and beyond.\n\n\"People haven't been shy about wanting to be like Omaha,\" said Andy Vobora, Travel Lane County's vice president for stakeholder relations, referring to the longtime home of the College World Series. \"We want to be the home of that championship.\"\n\nTracktown USA is bidding to host the 2025 U.S. Championships and when asked if they thought the 2028 Trials would be awarded to Los Angeles just as they were in 1984 when the city hosted the Olympic Games, Reilly said, \"We haven't started thinking about the next Trials yet.\"\n\n\"You go to Eugene all the time,\" said long jumper Tara Davis-Woodhall, the world indoor champion. \"It's a sh** show, yes.\"\n\nDavis-Woodhall was asked which location was easier to get to from her Fayetteville, Arkansas, training base: Paris or Eugene?\n\n\"Paris,\" Davis-Woodhall said laughing without missing a beat.\n\nA survey of flights last month from Fayetteville to Eugene showed coach fare prices ranging from $1,610 to $2,186. The latter fare is more than $200 more than the cheapest fare from Fayetteville to Paris during a three week window surrounding the Olympic Games. At 6-feet-7, 320 pounds, Crouser, the two-time Olympic shot put champion and Oregon native who also trains in Fayetteville, isn't likely to fly coach to Oregon. The cheapest non-coach fare from Fayetteville to Tracktown is $2,252.\n\nBut athletes don't only have to pay for themselves to get to Oregon. Athletes not affiliated with clubs also have to get their coaches, massage therapists, physical therapists, agents and family members there.\n\nAnd it's not just the cost of traveling to Eugene that frustrates athletes - and fans.\n\nOrlando International Airport is the closest major airport to Clermont, Florida, the training base of Lyles and Richardson and other top sprinters. The average travel time from Orlando to Eugene is 8 hours and 32 minutes.\n\nThe expenses continue to pile up once athletes and their teams and coaches reach Eugene.\n\nA ticket on Hayward Field's last row on the home stretch cost $130 for this Saturday's session which features the women's 100 meters and men's shot put final.\n\n\"Nowadays it's so expensive and I guess you guys know how expensive Eugene is and it sucks that we have to do that to our sport,\" Davis-Woodhall said. \"Tickets to see the best of the best in our entire nation just to make us spend 2 grand out of pocket just to watch a sport and then on top of it charge a $100 per day, per ticket.\"\n\nThen there's the hotel expenses.\n\nWorld class price gouging by local hotels and restaurants is as synonymous with Eugene as track, liberal politics and the ever-present aroma of marijuana.\n\nAccording to a survey of travel and hotel websites, 12 hotels in the Eugene-Springfield area are charging $400 or more per night, with 10 hotels asking for $500 or more and five setting rates as high as $600. A night at the Residence Inn will run you $677 per night. The LaQuinta Inn is charging $530 a night. A two-star hotel in Eugene is asking for $583 a night, or more than $200 more than what a room costs at the Beverly Hilton, home of the Golden Globes. Hoping to save with an Airbnb? Think again. A one-bedroom rental can cost you as much as $710 a night.\n\n\"It's difficult just getting myself to Eugene,\" said Thomas, who is sponsored by New Balance. \"It's so expensive. It's pretty far out of the way. And I think about that a lot, thinking about my recovery. Getting my team there is extremely expensive, coaches, physios, agents, my family. It costs thousands of dollars to get everybody there, especially when they jack up the prices. I was just talking about this with a couple of my teammates, a couple who are unsponsored and talking about how you're making this dream happen but it's only feasible if you have the money to do that.\n\n\"I think we're empathetic to that,\" Reilly said. \"We don't set hotel prices. We don't set airline prices. Eugene is located where it is. We work very hard with Travel Lane County and the local industry to do the best we can to get the hotel prices down. We've had lots of conversations about that, but in the end, we don't set those prices. What we can do is put forward a strong compelling bid. We can put forward the fact that we have a great stadium, we have an experienced and knowledgable workforce, volunteers here and we have a strong, vast network of community partners that make sure the experience is great. That's what we put forward when we bid and we'll continue to try and do that.\"\n\nVobora said Travel Lane County continues to have ongoing conversations with local businesses, warning them about trying to \"make hay on a handful of big events.\"\n\n\"We've heard that for a long time,\" Vobora said referring to Eugene's reputation for price gouging.\n\n\"If people take a look at other markets, it's supply and demand.\"\n\nVobora said local hotels have been better at setting aside blocks of rooms at lower rates especially for the NCAA Championships.\n\nBut Vobora also admitted the price gouging label has stuck to Tracktown.\n\n\"It's something we have to overcome,\" he said. \"It's a perception that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nBut officials from rival cities say Eugene's price gouging illustrates why it has become so difficult to compete with Tracktown USA.\n\n\"It's a big, big huge factor in that,\" Mt. SAC's Yokoyama said.\n\nThe argument from rival cities goes like this: Tracktown USA can afford the bid fees and other bid related costs because it receives state and local funding, which those governments and tourism agencies can justify by pointing to tax revenue generated by events like the Trials or other major meets. Markets like Los Angeles with other tourist attractions and a much larger hotel inventory have a harder time making the case for local funding based on economic impact projections for the Trials or NCAAs.\n\n\"We have five major airports,\" Yokoyama said. \"There's no way to price gouge.\"\n\nTracktown USA spent $120,000 on lobbying in 2016 and 2017, according to IRS filings and other financial records. Tracktown spent another $112,500 on lobbying in 2019 alone.The lobbying paid off. The Oregon legislature voted twice to increase the state's transient lodging tax, creating tens of millions to help fund the 2021 World Championships. The $40 million in state funding made up more than half the event's $75 million budget.\n\n\"Certainly the World Championships could not have gone forward without that support,\" Reilly said.\n\nWhen Tracktown USA had a cash flow problem leading up to the 2016 Olympic Trials, the City of Springfield granted the organization $75,000 in subsidies from the city's hotel tax revenues.\n\nThe state and local governments have received a significant return on their investment in Tracktown.\n\nThe 2022 World Championships had a $153.4 million economic impact, including $45 million in local accommodation revenues and $19.3 million in media exposure for the state of Oregon, according to an analysis by The Nielsen Company.\n\nThe Southern California New Group reached out to USA Track and Field for this report seeking an interview with Max Siegel, the organization's CEO, about the pros and cons of having so many meets in Eugene and to answer the following questions: How many cities applied to host the 2024 Olympic Trials? Has the host site for the 2025 U.S. Championships been selected? If so, who was selected? And was there an application fee for cities to post to bid to host the 2024 Olympic Trials? And if so, what was the fee?\n\nA USATF spokesperson responded by saying, \"We are fully focused on preparing for the upcoming Olympic Trials so do not have any interview availability at this time.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also provided a statement from Siegel:\n\n\"When selecting host sites for events, USA Track & Field's priorities are to provide athletes with the ultimate environment to perform at their best and fans with an unmatched viewing experience. The host of the 2024 Olympic Trials, Eugene, is known as the heart and home of track and field and has tried and tested infrastructure for our sport. Hayward Field is a world-class venue and fully equipped with best-in-class broadcasting capabilities. It has provided excellent conditions for athletes, fans, and officials and the city's passion for track and field creates an atmosphere that consistently elevates our sport. TrackTown USA is a great partner, and we genuinely appreciate and value our strong partnership with them and the great city of Eugene.\n\n\"Our effort in finding cities to host USATF events starts with a bid process, whether it is a masters, youth, elite or road race championship event. It is not a secret that hosting such events is both incredibly complex and costly and must have the commitment of many in a given community. USATF is fortunate to have cities all across the country hosting our events- indoors, outdoors and on the road. We look forward to working with even more locales as more facilities are built and become available to host at various levels of our competitions.\"\n\nTracktown USA has also benefited from having influential friends.\n\n\"We also don't have Uncle Phil to bankroll (a bid),\" Yokoyama said.\n\n\"Uncle Phil\" is billionaire Phil Knight, a former Oregon middle distance runner who co-founded Nike with legendary Ducks track coach Bill Bowerman.\n\nVin Lananna, then Oregon's head track coach and president of TrackTown USA, and Paul Weinhold, the University of Oregon Foundation's president, in July 2014 first pitched Governor John Kitzhaber a $40 million state subsidy for a bid to host the 2019 World Championships.\n\nThe Tracktown USA proposal was met with skepticism in the governor's office.\n\n\"There are a lot of hurdles to get over before it becomes much more than a pipe dream,\" Vince Porter, a Kitzhaber economic adviser, wrote in an analysis of the Tracktown USA plan adding that the proposal included \"probably as much as $20 million that we would never want to consider subsidizing. I don't think the state should be even considering something larger than $20 million\" to fund a track meet.\n\nYet by November, Tracktown USA's presentation at a bid meeting to the International Association of Athletics Federations (now World Athletics) at the organization's Monaco headquarters included a video message from Kitzhaber and Kate Brown, Oregon's secretary of state and later governor, in which the governor pledged to \"use all the means at my disposal to deliver the financial support needed for the championships.\"\n\nIn between Porter's skeptical report and Kitzhaber's public pledge, Kitzhaber received nearly $400,000 in campaign contributions from Knight, Nike, the company's CEO Mark Parker, and four University of Oregon board of trustees members.\n\nThe IAAF narrowly voted to award the 2019 Worlds to Doha over Eugene in November 2015. Three months later, in a surprise announcement, the IAAF awarded Tracktown USA the 2021 Worlds without holding a bidding process and after a secret meeting between Oregon bid representatives and IAAF officials\n\nThe chairman of the IAAF evaluation commission for potential Worlds sites was Coe, an IAAF vice president since 2007 who was elected the organization's president in August 2015.\n\nCoe was also hired as an ambassador by Nike in February 2013, nine months before the governing body awarded the 2016 World Indoor Championships to Portland. Nike has described his role as wide-ranging. After becoming president, Coe initially refused to give up his role with Nike, dismissing charges of conflict of interest before finally cutting ties with Nike amid public pressure in November 2015.\n\nNike is USATF's leading corporate sponsor. USATF and Nike agreed in 2014 to a 23-year extension of Nike's sponsorship deal worth $400 million.\n\nLananna, who was also president of USATF, and Reilly were both interviewed by federal investigators as part of FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigations into the awarding of the 2021 Worlds to Eugene.\n\nUSATF placed Lananna on \"temporary administrative leave\" pending the outcome of FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigations. The FBI and IRS were investigating possible fraud, racketeering and money laundering charges, according to media reports. There is no indication that Lananna or Reilly were targets of the investigation. There has been no indictment or public action taken by the Justice Department in the case.\n\nLananna, now the head track and cross country coach at Virginia, was reinstated as USATF president in December 2019.\n\n\"I'm not going to speak on any of those things,\" Reilly said in an interview earlier this month, referring to the FBI and IRS investigations. \"We were asked not to comment on those things so we're going to honor that request.\"\n\nThe current model for holding an Olympic Trials over a more than week-long period was the brainchild of Bowerman, who pushed the U.S. Olympic Committee to hold the 1968 Trials in Echo Summit on the same competition schedule as the Mexico City Games.\n\nThree years later Newland pitched a similar plan to the USOC for the 1972 Trials. Newland was right - the 1972 Trials were indeed a thing of beauty. Bob Seagren and Dave Wottle set world records in the pole vault and 800 meters. But the event will perhaps be best remembered for Prefontaine shattering his American record in the 5,000 while some in the sold out crowd wore \"Stop Pre\" t-shirts a sort of tongue-in-cheek response by a pair of local track fans - and Prefontaine supporters - to the popular \"Go Pre\" shirt worn by so many of the rebel runner's fans, an almost cult-like following known as \"Pre's People.\"\n\nThe 1972 Trials were also a hit at the box office. The meet generated a then-record $160,000 in revenue for the USOC and had an economic impact of between $600,000 and $800,000 on the Eugene-Springfield area, according to a University of Oregon study.\n\nFour years later Eugene held the first Trials where the men's and women's competitions were held at the same location. The Trials returned to Hayward Field again in 1980, dubbed the \"Trials to Nowhere\" because of Jimmy Carter's boycott of the Moscow Olympics.\n\nAfter Los Angeles hosted the 1984 Trials a month before the Olympic Games, a Eugene bid for the 1988 meet was undercut by concerns about a more than $3 million shortfall in funding renovations for Hayward Field and the Trials were awarded Indianapolis.\n\nIt would be another 20 years before Eugene would host another Olympic Trials, a group of Oregon Track Club officials following the footsteps of Newland, Bowerman and Rau securing the meet in 2005.\n\n\"The 2008 Olympic Trials was envisioned by the local organizing committee to be a catalyst for what happens after the 2008 Olympic Trials,\" Reilly said. \"It's wonderful to have an amazing 10 day spectacle and everybody goes home feeling awesome about that. But what do you do the morning after, what comes after that?\n\n\"The impetus behind it was to try and create a company that could not only attract the largest national events but at the time it was very important for us to be thinking about international, bringing in international events, which at the time the ultimate crazy idea was to try and host the World Championships.\"\n\n\"Being awarded that event in 2005, renovate Hayward Field and figure out what does it take to deliver the Olympic Trials, that was the primary focus. We didn't have a playbook at the time. We had to make up a playbook.\"\n\nA year after Eugene hosted a second straight Trials in 2012, Tracktown USA was formed.\n\nThat first year Tracktown USA reported $1.7 million in revenue and $3.1 million in assets. A year later the group received their first government grants totalling $681,996. The 2016 Olympic Trials helped bring the organization $15.1 million in revenue. Tracktown USA reported $55.6 million in revenue in 2022 with a budget of $74 million. Two subsidiary groups, Track Town Events LLC and Oregon 22 LLC reported $9.8 million and $45.59 million in revenue respectively in 2022.\n\n\"For the first several years of the company, kind of, Tracktown 1.0, the goal was what do we need to do to be in a position to have the best shot at bringing the World Championships to the United States,\" Reilly said. \"And you know you don't go from hosting nothing to hosting the largest championship in track and field. So we first did the World Under 20 Championships in 2014. Did the World Indoor Championships. Along the way there was this notion of OK we've got to keep doing the next step on the ladder but once we were awarded the event the mindset changed very much to a mindset we had with the very first big event in this community in recent times, the 2008 Olympic Trials.\"\n\nBut USATF awarded Mt. SAC the 2020 Trials in June 2017 over Eugene and Sacramento against the backdrop of concerns over whether the funding of the renovation of Hayward Field needed to hold the 2021 World Championships. A month earlier Knight had pulled out of the Hayward renovation project. At the time Mt. SAC was in the midst of a $87 million renovation of Hilmer Lodge Stadium.\n\n\"The board, and especially our active athletes, were clear in their desire to take the Olympic Trials back to Los Angeles,\" said Steve Miller, USATF board chairman, in announcing Mt. SAC's selection. \"Mt. SAC has long been one of the top meets in the country, from an athlete performance perspective as well as from an organizational perspective.\"\n\nIn April 2018 Knight recommitted to an updated plan to rebuild Hayward Field overseen by the former sports agent Howard Slusher, a longtime Knight confidant.\n\nA month later the USATF pulled the Trials from Mt. SAC and reopened the bidding process, contending that two lawsuits regarding the stadium renovation filed by citizens groups against the college had created \"resulting delays on planning for a successful 2020 U.S. Olympic Team Trials.\"\n\nBut the USATF move came just weeks after Walnut's city attorney signed a stipulation on lifting a preliminary injunction that was preventing grading on a renovation project and a Los Angeles Superior Court judge denied a citizen group's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the college tax-payer funds on a stadium renovation project. In issuing her temporary ruling denying the United Walnut Taxpayers request for the injunction, Judge Holly E. Kendig said that group was \"not likely to prevail\" at trial.\n\nThe 2020 Trials were awarded to Eugene and then after being pushed back to 2021 because of the pandemic, were held in the House that Uncle Phil Built.\n\nThe original Hayward Field was built in 1919 on a pasture for the cows that provided milk to the University of Oregon dorms across the street. The first track was made up of gravel and sawdust. A six lane cinder track was built in 1921.\n\nA century later Hayward Field is a $270 million state of the art stadium largely funded by the Nike co-founder, not a cow in sight. The stadium is anchored by a nine-story tower that resembles an Olympic torch adorned by Prefontaine's image forever looking forward.\n\nIt is a constant reminder to Reilly that he and a place that has proclaimed itself Tracktown USA now carry the torch passed down from Bowerman and Newland.\n\n\"After 2008 we ended up hosting the U.S. Championships several times, the NCAA Championships that put us on the path to have confidence in trying to bring international events here,\" Riley said. \"I think we took a similar mindset to the World Championships are going to be a spectacular event, but if we don't think about what happens after the World Championships then all it was was an extraordinarily expensive track and field meet that didn't move the needle at all.\"\n\nHe recalled the meetings nearly 20 years ago when the Oregon Track Club was trying to bring the Trials back to Eugene.\n\n\"Every meeting was, 'What is the vision for this event?' and, 'What is the vision for what comes after?'\"", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_m_reid@ocregister.com", "name": "Scott M.

If you'd like to read more of this kind of story, you can subscribe to get a print (and digital) version of SwimSwam Magazine here. This story was originally published in the 2016 Olympic issue of SwimSwam Magazine.\n\n\"The most devastating experience of my life.\"\n\nThat's how Eric Shanteau, who knows something about devastation (he's a cancer survivor, after all), has described the 2004 Olympic Trials, where he finished third in the 200 and 400 IM. He wasn't alone in his misery. While it's the dozens of qualifiers who understandably get all of the attention at every Olympic Trials, there's a smaller subset of about 25 swimmers who carry a heavy burden: they, like Shanteau, miss qualifying for an event by one spot. It's a lonely club - and not one that anybody wants to join. They know all too well why Trials is known to some as simply, \"The Meet of Tears.\"\n\nElite swimming is grueling enough as it is, but sometimes swimmers miss qualifying for the Olympics in ways that only the swim demons could design. Since 1984, there have been 31 instances of a swimmer falling short by less than one-tenth of a second. Four swimmers (Tara Kirk, Kristy Kowal, Ugur Tanner, Sarah Tolar) have missed by the slimmest margin possible: one one-hundredth of a second. And four swimmers other than Shanteau have been one spot away from qualifying for two events at the same Trials: Brendan Hansen, Hayley McGregory, Elizabeth Pelton, and Kim Small. McGregory is a special case. She just missed making the team in the 100 and 200 back in 2004, and then came back in 2008 and swam the same events, with the exact same outcome.\n\nPerhaps cruelest of all, in 2008 both Kirk and Lara Jackson finished third - Kirk in the 100 breast and Jackson in the 50 free. A few days later, Jessica Hardy, who qualified in both events, was removed from the team after testing positive for a banned substance. But rather than elevate Kirk and Jackson to the team, USA Swimming officials filled the slot with swimmers who had already made the team in other events.\n\nAs these examples show, even the most accomplished swimmers can fall one spot short. Consider the collection of water wonders who came oh so close at the 2012 Trials: Nathan Adrian (50 free), Natalie Coughlin (100 back), Jessica Hardy (100 breast), Katie Ledecky (400 free), and Dana Vollmer (100 free). Others who have missed by one place over the years include icons like Janet Evans, Cullen Jones, Ryan Lochte, Pablo Morales, and SWIMSWAM's own Mel Stewart. He entered the 1996 Trials with the fastest qualifying time in the 200 fly, and possessed the American record, as well as a gold medal in the event from the Barcelona Olympics four years earlier. But in the finals, a Stanford swimmer named Ray Carey finished .23 ahead of him to snag second place and a trip to Atlanta. \"Getting third at Olympic Trials hurts,\" says Stewart. \"It was crushing then, and still stings a bit today. I appreciate the experience, and making sense of the loss was character-building, but it doesn't change the fact that I fought to make the Olympic Team and fell short.\"\n\nWhile every swimmer has a different way of dealing with the disappointment, the unifying theme is agony. Finishing one place out can lead to solitude - sometimes voluntary and sometimes not, as friends and family can offer moral support but they struggle with what condolences to offer. \"Better luck next time\" simply doesn't cut it when \"next time\" is four years away - and may never come. Even more toxic, some swimmers don't want to be in the presence of those who have narrowly fallen short, fearing that the bad karma associated with such a finish could be contagious.\n\nThe reality is that life goes on whether one makes the Olympic team or not. And SWIMSWAM caught up with two celebrated swimmers who are all-too-familiar with Olympic Trials letdowns.\n\nMichelle Griglione is the most decorated American swimmer never to have made an Olympic team. It was not for a lack of trying.\n\nIn 1984, at the tender age of 15, she narrowly missed making the team, finishing third in the 200 IM and fourth in the 400 IM. \"It was a shock\" to come so close, she says, but given her youth and her modest expectations entering Trials, \"missing the team was not a major disappointment.\" And she had every reason to believe that with more experience would come faster times and Olympic team slots. Indeed, later that summer she swam an IM time that would have won her a silver medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. (Fun fact: Griglione's coach was the fabled John Flanagan, SWIMSWAM's 2013 Club Coach of the Year and one-time coach of current UC-Berkeley phenom Andrew Seliskar.)\n\nFour years later, Griglione had accumulated that experience, both domestically (she was swimming for Stanford) and internationally (she won a silver medal at the 1986 world championship meet in Madrid). Naturally, she had very high hopes entering Olympic Trials. And she had an acute understanding of what was at stake, telling the Washington Post, \"You're either first or second in the next minute or else everything you worked the last five years for goes down the tubes. I can't think of anything worse.\"\n\nAlas, the outcome was no better than four years earlier - and in some ways worse. She finished third twice - in the 200 fly (by .25) and the 400 IM (by 2.84 seconds). And she finished fourth in the 100 fly and 200 IM. She uses the same word as Shanteau to describe the feeling of not making the team: \"devastating.\"\n\nShe returned home to Alexandria, Virginia and laid low - \"very low,\" she says. \"I basically didn't want to go anywhere. I just wanted to stay in my house and avoid any kind of reality.\" Intensifying the pain, she says, was the amount of media attention devoted to the Olympics. \"It was really hard to get away from it.\" She was, of course, rooting for the American swimmers, but she confesses that she didn't have the stomach to watch the swimming events on TV. (And to this day, she still hasn't watched any of the video clips.)\n\nFollowing Trials, she assumed her quest for the Olympics was over, but she returned to Stanford and immediately resumed swimming under the school's new head coach, Richard Quick. Stanford promptly won the women's NCAA title and Griglione won the 400 IM. \"That took a lot of the sting out of not making the team,\" she says today, \"but not all of it.\" While she says she did not distinguish herself in the pool during her two final years at Stanford, she decided upon graduating in 1991 to move home and train with the premier team in the Washington, DC area, Curl-Burke. Two of her friends from the training group - Roque Santos and Sergio Lopez - made the team (Lopez for Spain), as did four Stanford swimmers. Griglione did not - finishing fourth in both the 200 fly and 200 IM. \"There's no sugarcoating it - I was absolutely disappointed.\"\n\nHer only plan after that was graduate school at the University of Florida, to study chemical engineering. She wasn't expecting to continue swimming, but she found that she was still fast and so she began working out with the team. She entered meets, and ultimately made the national team. \"I was having a really good time,\" she recalls. She was taking her swimming year-by-year, and when she found herself back in the Washington area for a job at the Goddard Space Center, she had quality pool time, and ultimately qualified for the 1996 Olympic Trials. She won U.S. nationals in the 200 fly, and had the fastest qualifying time entering Trials. But she swam two seconds slower and placed fifth. She recalls going to the warm-down pool and taking a moment to ask herself, \"Why? What am I doing?\" Having just swum her last race, she realized there was no need for her to warm down. So she didn't.\n\nIt was a small show of defiance for the highly-disciplined Griglione, who today shows remarkable equanimity when asked to reflect on her career. She says that while it was a \"very painful\" never to make an Olympic team, the hardest part of all of was that failing to ever qualify \"became the focus of my career for other people. . . . But I didn't want the Olympics to define my entire set of accomplishments. I knew that what I had accomplished was pretty special and that I was in rarefied air. Once I got out of it, I realized that the world I was in was uncommon, and that helped me get a better perspective what I had accomplished - and not focus on what I hadn't.\"\n\nAsked if she would give any advice to swimmers who just miss making the team, she says, \"you do need to keep it in perspective. I've often thought that I am very fortunate that that is the worst thing that's happened to me. If that's the hardest thing I've had to go through, I'm pretty lucky.\"\n\nIf William Shakespeare ever wrote a play about swimming, one thing is certain: there would be a tragic character christened \"Tarwater.\" In the Bard's telling, Tarwater would train alongside many of the world's most accomplished swimmers. He would strive for years to make an Olympic team, only to miss by mere tenths of a second. And so his career - distinguished in so many other ways - would be tarred by what he didn't do in the water: qualify for the Olympic team.\n\nThat's (almost) the story of Davis Tarwater. As an upstart 20-year-old in at the 2004 Olympic Trials, he surprised many by finishing fourth in the 200 fly - just .45 behind his friend and University of Michigan training partner, Tom Malchow. The loss was \"very hard,\" Tarwater has said, adding that he didn't respond the right way. \"The lesson I learned was that I needed to be even more focused on the goal. I have to be even more singularly focused on the Olympics. And I think that kind of drove me a little bit crazy. It just didn't make the journey very pleasant, very fun, or the process very thrilling.\"\n\nOver the next four years, qualifying for the Olympic team became Tarwater's overarching obsession. He made the national team, he finished fourth at Worlds in 2005 and seemed likely to be a lock for Beijing. Once again swimming the 200 fly, his finals time was more than three seconds faster than it had been four years earlier. But it wasn't fast enough, as Gil Stovall swam a lifetime best to snag second.\n\nFailing to qualify, Tarwater said later, left him with \"the most empty feeling in the world. . . . It felt like my life was over.\" Eric Wunderlich, who finished third in the 100 breast at Trials in both 1992 and 1996, contacted him. \"He told me, 'do what you want to do and do what feels right, whether that's travel or just decompressing. There's no right answer.' That helped me.\"\n\nThe following year Tarwater enrolled in a graduate program at Oxford University and figured his swimming career was finished (though he did win the British version of NCAA's in the 100 back). But as he was finishing his coursework the following year, he began re-thinking retirement and concluded, \"I need to finish this story.\" He was determined to change the script and change his motives. He contacted David Marsh of SwimMAC in the fall of 2010 and said he wanted to make a comeback. Marsh gave him a spot on the elite team, but knowing what had happened in 2008, he told Tarwater, \"I want to make sure you're not trying to exorcise demons from the past. You should be coming back because you want to and because you believe in the process and the sport.\"\n\nAt Trials, Tarwater, in consultation with Marsh, was heavily focused on the 200 free - an event where six swimmers would qualify for the Olympic team (the additional swimmers would be used for the 4 x 200 relay). He advanced to the finals, only to finish . . . seventh, by a razor-thin margin of .14. Immediately afterwards, he said the feeling of disappointment was completely different than it had been four years earlier. \"I knew I'd done everything I could do. And I understood that I had a future in life outside the sport.\" He recalls walking out of the swim venue after his final race in the 100 fly and saying, \"Thank you God for the opportunity to chase this dream.\" And he posted a message on Facebook that made clear his swimming career was over: \"I have finished the race. . . . On to the next dream.\"\n\nAt dinner with his parents, he decided didn't want to stick around for the end of the meet, so he changed his flight and flew back to Charlotte the next morning. With his swimming career finished, he figured he could let loose and while driving to his apartment in Charlotte he stopped at a Wendy's, where he splurged on a double hamburger and cheese fries.\n\nSitting on his couch, chewing on his chow, Marsh called him and shared something unforgettable: Michael Phelps, who had finished first in the 200, had decided he wasn't going to swim the event at the London Olympics. (While Phelps and Tarwater are friends and trained together for four years at the University of Michigan, the withdrawal was a total surprise.) It meant Tarwater was in the top six. He immediately started receiving calls and texts from people in Omaha - but he didn't have confirmation that he was on the team. Twenty minutes later, Marsh called him back: \"Davis, you're an Olympian. You need to get to Omaha and accept this in person.\" Tarwater immediately called his mom, who broke into tears upon hearing the news. He then booked the next available flight back to Omaha - this time, fittingly, in first class.\n\nThe next four weeks were a whirlwind of activity, which culminated with his Olympic swim in a preliminary heat of the 800 free relay. He and his teammates secured a top seed, and in the finals the USA team won by more than three seconds - which meant a gold medal for Tarwater. He loved being a part of the team and participating in the pomp and circumstance that accompanies the Olympics. But most fulfilling of all, he says today, \"was the pursuit and the opportunity to chase an Olympic dream.\" With the benefit of hindsight, he recognizes that, \"If it's only about the goal, there's an emptiness. There's so much more to offer than the ultimate goal. There's so much more this sport has to offer than a single ultimate goal. It's about relationships, personal growth and the process of chasing a dream. That is what is exhilarating about this sport and it took my whole career to realize that.\"\n\nThat's a useful life lesson for everyone to remember, but particularly for the cluster of swimmers who find themselves one spot away from Rio, with an acute understanding of just why Trials can be \"The Meet of Tears.\"", "source": {"uri": "swimswam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SwimSwam"},

Here's who they are", "body": "Cole Hocker is looking for trip back to the Summer Games.\n\nCooper Teare is looking to make his first Olympic team.\n\nBoth are giving themselves two shots to compete in Paris.\n\nThe former Oregon stars are entered in the men's 1,500 and 5,000 meters during the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials taking place at Hayward Field Friday through June 30.\n\nThey will see plenty of familiar faces.\n\nHocker and Teare are among 27 Ducks entered in 34 events at the Olympic Trials, including five others entered in the 1,500, which contests its opening heats beginning at 5:22 p.m. Friday.\n\nJoining Hocker and Teare are three-time Olympian and 2016 gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz, who is attempting to make one last team before retiring.\n\nAlso entered is Oregon junior Elliott Cook, the Pac-12 champion and NCAA runner-up, Sam Prakel, John Gregorek and Matt Wisner. Prakel is also entered in the 5,000, and Wisner is also entered in the 800.\n\nHocker was the 2021 Olympic Trials winner and went on to place sixth in the Olympic final in Tokyo.\n\nHe comes in with a personal-record time of 3 minutes, 30.70 seconds. He also ran 3:48.95 in the mile on May 25 during the Pre Classic and set his 5K PR a month ago when he ran 12:58.82 -- fourth fastest by an American this year.\n\n\"I'm feeling extremely confident,\" Hocker said after his Pre Classic performance. \"I think the 5K has given me a lot more confidence, more than anything else in my training because in my mind, I've always had that speed and lacked a bit of that strength and I think we're seeing the 1,500 move to more of a strength event. As opposed to more 800-1,500 guys it's more 1,500-5K guys now. I think working that top end is really, really helping me.\"\n\nTeare was fourth in the 5,000 during the 2021 Olympic Trials and went on to win the U.S. title in the 1,500 in 2022.\n\nHe'll come into the meet as the U.S. leader in the 1,500 with a season-best of 3:32.16, and the U.S. No. 2 in the 5,000 with a season-best of 12:54.72.\n\nBoth are also PRs.\n\n\"I want to give myself a shot to make both teams and I think that's definitely in the cards,\" Teare said during the Pre Classic. \"Why not? Racing is the fun part of the season. I've made a 1,500 team before and I was one spot off the 5K team in 2021 so I know I can do it.\"\n\nAfter Teare spent some time with the Bowerman Track Club under coach Jerry Schumacher, he rejoined Hocker this year to train under former Oregon distance coach Ben Thomas, who is now the coach at Virginia Tech.\n\nDespite being former collegiate teammates and roommates and current training partners, both will return to Hayward Field with similar goals -- goals that might mean sending the other home unhappy.\n\n\"I think that's kinda the limit of where our teammates and friendship kind of goes,\" Teare said with a laugh. \"Realistically, we train together, we race together, we're basically living together, and I think we both know each other's strengths and weaknesses. We're definitely not out to get each other, but a race is a race and you always want to win.\"\n\nOregon Ducks in US Olympic Track and Field Trials", "source": {"uri": "eu.registerguard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Register-Guard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_trials_(track_and_field)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic trials (track and field)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Hocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Hocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Teare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Teare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5K run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefontaine_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prefontaine Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Centrowitz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Centrowitz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hayward Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5000 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gregorek_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Gregorek Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Prakel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Prakel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowerman_Track_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowerman Track Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Schumacher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Schumacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/09/16/NREG/70879556007-bb-3-i-6840-copy.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4336,2450,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663384", "eventUri": "eng-9663384", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 339, "textEnd": 346}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 1138, "textEnd": 1144}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

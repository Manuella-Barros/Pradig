His wife, Dr Clare Bailey, is also scouring the island for her husband with friends, according to the island's mayor. The TV doctor, known for appearances on This Morning, was reported missing on Wednesday after he left a beach without his phone. The mayor of the Greek island Symi, Eleftherios Papakaloudoukas, has vowed that the search will continue until the TV star is found. A team of firefighters resumed the search for the doctor at 6am this morning, scouring a 6.5km (four-mile) radius over a mountainous area that is surrounded by sea. Manolis Tsimpoukas, who organises searches for missing people on the Dodecanese Islands, said there had been no sign of the star in the 'very dangerous' area.

It is understood Mosley, 67, was last seen by CCTV at a grey-stoned house beside a harbour on the island. He may have headed towards a steep uphill concrete road that leads into rocky landscape. Mayor Papakaloudoukas said the area where Mosley is believed to have travelled through is \"difficult to pass\" and is \"only rocks\". It is also populated by \"loads\" of snakes. He also questioned how anyone could survive in the heat that topped 40C in the area on the day Mosley disappeared. He pointed to a search dog being used in the operation only being able to work for an hour on Saturday morning to highlight the intense temperatures the area is facing. The search to find Mosley was described as a \"race against time\" by one of the rescuers on Friday. Mr Papakaloudoukas said he hoped Mosley would be found \"safe and alive\", adding: \"All the community is so sad about this, (it has) never happened before.\"", "summary": "Michael Mosley has been missing since Wednesday afternoon and a search has so far no found trace of the TV doctor", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/dr-michael-mosleys-four-children-29319003", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29318387.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michael-Mosley-missing.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:39:56", "author": "Katy Hallam", "authors": ["Katy Hallam"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.13}

They were trying to comfort them and make sure that their heads were out of the water so they could breathe. And then after an hour or so, all of a sudden the ones that were in the water that were still alive left and went out to sea,\" Wiese said.\n\n\"They may well decide to come back to shore somewhere on another beach nearby or something -- that often happens, but we're hopeful that they won't,\" Wiese added.\n\nThe Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions has yet to confirm the rescues.\n\nA team of wildlife officers, marine scientists and veterinarians had earlier reached the scene and reported 26 dead among up to 160 stranded.\n\nAt that time, an additional 20 whales were in a pod about 1.5 kilometers (almost a mile) offshore and 110 whales formed a pod closer to the beach, the department said.\n\nRegional wildlife officer Pia Courtis said the pod of 110 whales was \"sticking together offshore\" and was likely to come toward the beach.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the outcome for our pilot whales once they strand on the beach is generally not good. We have high numbers of animals that end up dying,\" Courtis said.\n\nIn July, almost 100 long-finned pilot whales died or were euthanized after a two-day rescue attempt in a mass stranding on Cheynes Beach near the former whaling station of Albany, 355 kilometers (220 miles) southeast of Dunsborough.\n\nDunsborough is 285 kilometers (177 miles) by road south of Perth, Western Australia state's capital and largest city.\n\nBased on previous strandings, including the 2023 Cheynes Beach event, euthanizing the beached whales is usually the most humane outcome, the department said in a statement.\n\n\"We always hope for the best outcome,\" the statement said.\n\nWiese said Thursday was the third mass stranding he had responded to and the result was by far the best.\n\n\"It's been a very good story today because normally with these sorts of strandings, you wind up with 100 whales beaching and five or six being saved,\" Wiese said.\n\nCourtis said the whales were believed to have become stranded early Thursday.\n\nThe dead whales were dragged from the water so that their carcasses didn't attract sharks.\n\nDunsborough was the scene of a mass stranding of 320 long-finned pilot whales in 1996.

They haven't made it back to shore but we will keep monitoring them.\n\n'They haven't been reported coming in closer than that, so hopefully they are out there in deeper water.'\n\nAuthorities are collecting morphmetric measurements to determine the sex and age of the whales that are dead, then will conduct post mortem tests\n\nMs Courtis said it was important to remove the dead whales from the water to stop encouraging other whales that were in the water to strand back again and they were using vessels to keep the pilot whales that were in deeper water offshore.\n\n'Every whale stranding is different and there are different situations, so it is hard to say, but we have learnt some things from Cheynes Beach (Albany),' she said.\n\n'We put those into play here but it is hard to tell it is a different location, but we will try to take as many samples as we can to see if there is anything happening in the population.\n\n'Obviously, when you have large groups of whales you do attract other species in like sharks, so people need to be mindful of other species that are around.\n\n'What we want to do is keep people safe and want to stabilise our animals quickly, and think about the health and welfare of those animals that are beached.'\n\nDBCA senior research scientist of marine fauna Holly Raudino said there were a variety of reasons why whales might beach themselves and it could be that one member of the pod was ill and the others followed it.\n\n'Sometimes it might be some kind of noise disturbance, or disease could be a factor so it is very varied,' she said.\n\n'We are taking a number of samples, particularly the priority is to exclude infectious diseases.'\n\nAuthorities are collecting morphmetric measurements to determine the sex and age of the whales that are dead, then will conduct post mortem tests.\n\n'I have only seen some of the animals, but it looks like most of them are adult females with a few young ones, but no initial ideas as to what's caused the stranding,' she said.\n\n'There was an anecdotal report that one of the individuals was visibly ill and it is one of the whales still free swimming out there.\n\nThe whales stranded themselves at Toby's Inlet, near Dunsborough\n\nA Parks and Wildlife spokesperson said they were making every effort to safely respond and keep volunteers and staff safe, while also acting interests of the whales.\n\n'Our team is assessing the conditions of the whales that have stranded on the beach,' a spokesperson said.\n\n'Our teams on the water are trying to keep the animals together and away from the beach.\n\n'Based on previous strandings involving this species of whale, such as at Cheynes Beach near Albany last year, these events usually resulted in beached animals having to be euthanised as the most humane outcome.\n\n'We always hope for the best outcome.'\n\nEarlier, police and authorities asked people to keep away from the rescue effort as cars lined nearby roads with people who wanted to help and see the huge rescue effort that was underway.\n\n'While we appreciate the strong desire to help, the area has become overcrowded with volunteers who are impacting on authorities attempting to mobilise a response,' a police spokesperson said.\n\n'If your vehicle is parked on Caves Road, please considering moving it to allow for the access of resources.\n\n'Your co-operation is very much appreciated.'\n\nA Parks and Wildlife spokesperson said they knew people wanted to help but asked that people did not attempt to rescue the whales without direction from DBCA staff, because it could cause further injury and distress to the animals and hinder a co-ordinated rescue effort\n\nA Parks and Wildlife spokesperson said they knew people wanted to help but asked that people did not attempt to rescue the whales without direction from DBCA staff, because it could cause further injury and distress to the animals and hinder a co-ordinated rescue effort.\n\n'The highest priority at mass whale stranding events is always human safety followed by animal welfare.'\n\n'We want all staff and volunteers to go home safe.\n\n'We ask that people please follow instructions of DBCA staff to ensure the highest human safety and animal welfare outcomes are achieved.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Human-made undersea noise could also interfere with their navigation.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsborough,_Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Biodiversity,_Conservation_and_Attractions_(Western_Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-finned_pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long-finned pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albany, Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Beach_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Beach Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/04/25/08/wire-84068749-1714029051-641_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510843", "eventUri": "eng-9510843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The agency planned to take biological samples and measurements from the dead whales for research.\n\nAfter marine officials and volunteers had helped the other whales back out to sea, boats were on the water and a spotter plane was monitoring the area to ensure they did not return to shore.\n\nThe four pods of 160 pilot whales were spread across about 1,640 feet of beach at the Toby Inlet, near the town of Dunsborough, in Western Australia on Thursday morning, local wildlife officials said, in a statement on social media.\n\nPhotos shared by the wildlife service on Facebook showed rows of whales lying on the shore as crowds gathered to see the mass stranding.\n\nThe rescued whales had moved farther offshore on Thursday and were last seen traveling north, the wildlife department said.\n\n\"So far, so good -- they haven't made it back to shore, but we will keep monitoring them,\" Ms. Courtis said.\n\nOfficials said they did not know what had caused the stranding, which included mostly adult females and a few calves. In general, experts have theorized that the causes for such strandings may include pods of whales following a sick, or stuck, whale and getting stuck themselves; the confusion brought about by undersea noise caused by humans; or an attempt to avoid predators.\n\nSeveral mass strandings have unfolded in Australia in recent years.\n\nIn July, a pod of almost 100 long-finned pilot whales was stranded in the shallow waters off a remote beach in Western Australia. More than 50 died, and the rest were later euthanized.\n\nOne of Australia's deadliest strandings took place in 2020, when 470 whales were beached on a coastline in Tasmania. Most of them died.\n\nPilot whales can grow to 24 feet in length and weigh up to 6,600 pounds. When pilot whales are stranded, rescuers are often in a race against time because once the whales are out of the water the weight of their bodies can crush their organs.\n\nPilot whales, which can be short or long-finned, are known for being social animals, and tend to live in large schools of hundreds of whales separated into close-knit pods of 10 to 20 individuals, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nExperts said the mass strandings on beaches pointed to the whales' strong social ties.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsborough,_Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-finned_pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long-finned pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tasmania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surf_Life_Saving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surf Life Saving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/25/multimedia/25xp-whales-02-kmpb/25xp-whales-02-kmpb-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510843", "eventUri": "eng-9510843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

A little further from the coast, another herd of around 110 whales was also found in deeper water.\n\nAnimal rights activists and local residents rushed to the beach to douse the 160 pilot whales with water to keep them alive. However, local authorities urged the public to only approach the whales under the guidance of experts.\n\n\"We know people want to help but we asked that people please do not attempt to rescue the animals without direction of DBCA staff as this may cause further injury, and distress to the animals and hinder a coordinated rescue effort,\" the authority said in a statement.\n\n\"The highest priority at mass whale stranding events is always human safety followed by animal welfare. We want all staff and volunteers to go home safe.\"\n\nMarine expert Ian Wiese, who was at the scene, told Radio ABC Perth that several whales had already died.\n\n\"The others are just thrashing around and we'll have many deaths in the next few hours,\" Wiese said. \"It's terrible... there's lots of theories around the world but nobody's really been able to find a cause.\"\n\nThe largest mass stranding in Australia was in the same area in 1996, when 320 long-finned pilot whales were beached.

Conservation and Attractions said 29 whales had died.\n\n\"We're in the stage of removing them off the beach and taking measurements and samples,\" Regional Wildlife Officer Pia Courtis said.\n\nThe remaining whales that were spread across 500 metres of the beach were helped back out into the ocean where another two pods of about 130 animals were sticking together offshore.\n\nMost of the whales appeared to be adult females with a few calves, Senior Research Scientist Marine Fauna Holly Raudino said.\n\nWhale researcher Ian Wiese was at the \"terrible\" scene where he saw many of the dead creatures but said considering the sheer number that were on the beach, it was a good outcome.\n\n\"When you consider what could have happened here, it has been a really good result,\" the Geographe Marine Research chair told ABC.\n\nHe said it was the biggest stranding event he had ever seen in the area.\n\nBut concerns remain that the whales will strand themselves on another beach nearby despite being hauled back into the ocean.\n\n\"That often happens but we are hopeful that they will not,\" he said.\n\nBoats are in the water trying to prevent the pod from stranding again.\n\n\"We've got vessels and a spotter plane up in the air doing searches every couple hours to see where they are,\" Ms. Courtis said.\n\n\"So far so good they haven't made it back to shore but we will keep monitoring them.\"\n\nMany volunteers helped to turn the whales so they could breathe and splashed water on their backs while they were beached.\n\n\"There were a couple of hundred people who were with the whales, they were trying to comfort and make sure that their heads were out of the water so they could breathe,\" Mr. Wiese said.\n\n\"After an hour or so, the ones that were in the water that were still alive went out to sea.\"\n\nThe last mass stranding of whales in WA was at Cheynes Beach in Albany in July 2023 where at least 90 of the mammals died.\n\nIn light of the Cheynes Beach stranding and the behaviour of pilot whales, Parks and Wildlife were concerned many of the whales at the Toby's Inlet incident would have to be euthanised but thankfully rescue efforts were successful.\n\nIt remains unclear why whales strand themselves.\n\n\"No one really understands, the world is puzzled by these sorts of events and I do not think we are very much closer to

We have high numbers of animals that end up dying,\" Ms Courtis said.\n\nIn July, almost 100 long-finned pilot whales died or were euthanised after a two-day rescue attempt in a mass stranding on Cheynes Beach near the former whaling station of Albany, 220 miles south east of Dunsborough.\n\nDunsborough is 177 miles by road south of Perth, Western Australia state's capital and largest city.\n\nBased on previous strandings, including the 2023 Cheynes Beach event, euthanising the beached whales is usually the most humane outcome, the department said in a statement.\n\n\"We always hope for the best outcome,\" the statement said.\n\nMr Wiese said Thursday was the third mass stranding he had responded to and the result was by far the best.\n\n\"It's been a very good story today because normally with these sorts of strandings, you wind up with a 100 whales beaching and five or six being saved,\" Mr Wiese said.\n\nMs Courtis said the whales were believed to have become stranded early on Thursday.\n\nThe dead whales were dragged from the water so that their carcasses did not attract sharks.\n\nDunsborough was the scene of a mass stranding of 320 long-finned pilot whales in 1996. Only 20 died on that occasion, with rescuers returning the rest to sea.\n\nScientists do not know what causes whales to strand, although it appears their location systems can be confused by gently sloping, sandy beaches.\n\nTheories include that they are avoiding predators such as killer whales, or following a sick leader ashore.

The region is less than 250km (155 miles) south of state capital Perth.\n\nFootage from the area showed wildlife preservation teams and local authorities joined by many volunteers to help them get back to deeper waters.\n\nPia Courtis, a spokesperson for the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, said samples would be taken from the deceased whales before removing them from the shores.\n\nMore than 100 whales were moved offshore, but Courtis said they may return.\n\n\"We've got vessels out on the water and we've also got a spotter plane up in the air that's doing searches over every couple of hours to see where they are,\" she said.\n\n\"So far so good, they haven't made it back to shore.\"\n\nThe department said that once fully beached, whales usually had to be euthanised as that would be \"the most humane outcome\".\n\nMass strandings of pilot whales are not uncommon in Australia and New Zealand. But after decades of such events, scientists do not fully understand why they occur. Some researchers think pods go off track after feeding too close to shore.\n\nPilot whales - which can grow to more than 6 metres (20 feet) long - are highly sociable, so they may follow podmates who stray into danger.\n\nSome stranding incidents have been linked to underwater noise pollution caused by humans, which could affect the animals' sensitive hearing.\n\nWildlife experts have said the whales' unusual behaviour could also indicate stress or illness within a pod. Pilot whales often maintain close relationships with their pods throughout their lives.\n\nAbout 500 pilot whales died when they beached on New Zealand's remote Chatham Islands in 2022.\n\nThe latest mass stranding event in Western Australia occurred at Cheynes Beach in Albany in July 2023, where at least 90 of the mammals died.\n\nThe largest beaching of whales in Western Australia took place in Dunsborough in 1996 and involved 320 long-finned pilot whales.

However at least 28 whales died.\n\nWhale pods can beach themselves again even after being saved. As a result spotter planes in the area are continuing to watch and see if the released animals will return to shore. \"So far, they have remained off the beach,\" Weise said.\n\n\"My initial reaction seeing hundreds of whales all bunched (together) on the beach was just completely and utterly overwhelming.

Another 100 or so of the whales were rescued and redirected out to sea from Toby's Inlet, which is at the lower tip of Western Australia, about 150 miles from Perth, the state capital.\n\nImages released Thursday by Western Australia's Parks and Wildlife Service showed a large group of pilot whales crowded together at the edge of the Toby's Inlet shoreline, where the ocean meets the land. Although many were still submerged in the very shallow water, several of the whales were fully beached.\n\nWildlife officers, marine scientists and veterinarians were deployed to the site. Just before noon, the parks and wildlife service reported that four pods of as many as 160 pilot whales were stranded in the water and spread across an area of roughly 1,600 feet, with 26 whales stranded on the beach itself.\n\n\"Our team is making every effort to safely respond and keep volunteers and staff safe, while also acting in the best interests of the whales,\" the wildlife service said as they worked to manage the situation. \"Our team is assessing the conditions of the whales that have stranded on the beach. Our teams on the water are trying to keep the animals together and away from the beach.\"\n\nOfficials said originally that the beached whales would likely need to be euthanized, based on previous similar incidents. Last July, dozens of whales belonging to the same species died on a different beach in Western Australia after becoming stranded. In the end, the wildlife service said that 51 whales had died of the 96 that were stranded.\n\nIan Wiese, a whale researcher, was one of hundreds of volunteers that helped wildlife officials carry out their rescue operation, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"When I first arrived, there was, I think, 160 in the water -- almost out of the water -- and there were a couple of hundred people who were with the whales, they were trying to comfort them and make sure that their heads were out of the water so they could breathe. And then after an hour or so, all of a sudden the ones that were in the water that were still alive left and went out to sea,\" Weise told the AP.\n\n\"They may well decide to come back to shore somewhere on another beach nearby or something -- that often happens, but we're hopeful that they won't,\" he said.\n\nIn the wildlife service's final update Thursday, Pia Courtis, a regional wildlife officer, confirmed that the larger group of rescued whales had been routed out to sea. A \"spotter plane\" surveyed the area but did not see those pods during the flight, which Courtis suggested could be a promising sign.\n\n\"There has been no further sightings of the pod this afternoon, which is good news,\" Courtis said. \"The spotter plane will continue to monitor the area during daylight hours, but we are hopeful that the pod will not return to the shallower water.\"\n\nThe dead pilot whales were being removed from the beach when Courtis gave that last update. The wildlife officer said they would collect measurements and some samples to biopsy from the animals before moving them to a landfill. Courtis said the hope is that information taken from carcasses will help scientists understand this species better, and the pod specifically, to hopefully gain insight into why they were stranded.\n\nLong-finned pilot whales are a large species of dolphin, with individuals usually measuring between 19 and 25 feet in length and weighing between 2,900 and 5,000 pounds, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A pilot whale's typical lifespan is anywhere from 35 to 60 years, although their survival is threatened by several factors including chemical contaminants, disease, entanglement in fishing gear and ocean noise. They tend to travel in dense pods, and much of what is known about the species and their behaviors has come out of other mass strandings.\n\nReasons behind whales and dolphins becoming stranded or beaching themselves are not always clear. Depending on the scenario, scientists and experts have posited in the past that injury or illness of one or more animals in a given pod could contribute to the phenomenon, as well as unusual weather and attempts to escape underwater dangers like entanglements.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-finned_pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long-finned pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bycatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bycatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contamination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cetacea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/25/4c0c3748-de99-469e-b6a8-1f94624ebf7b/thumbnail/1200x630/b737f3fd257a640b00790ea616a9ac7a/ap24116094762350.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510843", "eventUri": "eng-9510843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In 2023 close to 100 long-finned pilot whales died after they stranded themselves at Cheynes Beach, near Albany in WA.

I've managed (whale strandings) before but nothing ever of this size,\" Wiese told CNN.\n\nIn total, 130 whales were returned to sea after a total of 160 were beached, according to the department of Parks and Wildlife Service Western Australia (DPAW).

Ships and a spotter plane were monitoring the rescued whales in case they returned to shore, said wildlife officer Pia Courtis. \"So far so good, they haven't made it back to shore, but we will keep monitoring them,\" Courtis said. Local whale researcher Ian Wiese joined hundreds of volunteers who helped rescue the whales at Toby's Inlet near the tourist town of Dunsborough.\n\n\"When I first arrived, there was, I think, 160 in the water -- almost out of the water -- and there were a couple of hundred people who were with the whales, they were trying to comfort them and make sure that their heads were out of the water so they could breathe. And then after an hour or so, all of a sudden the ones that were in the water that were still alive left and went out to sea,\" Wiese said. In July, almost 100 long-finned pilot whales died or were euthanized after a two-day rescue attempt in a mass stranding on Cheynes Beach. Wiese said Thursday was the third mass stranding he had responded to and the result was by far the best. \"It's been a very good story today because normally with these sorts of strandings, you wind up with a 100 whales beaching and five or six being saved,\" Wiese said.\n\nMarine scientist Holly Raudino said tissue samples had been taken from the dead whales to exclude potential causes of the stranding, in particular infectious disease. Scientists don't know what causes whales to strand, although it appears their location systems can be confused by gently sloping, sandy beaches. Theories include that they are avoiding predators such as killer whales, or following a sick leader ashore. Human-made undersea noise could also interfere with their navigation.

The state experienced its largest whale stranding at Dunsborough in 1996 when 320 pilot whales beached themselves.\n\nPilot whales are known for their tight-knit social bonds, so when one gets into difficulty and strands, the rest often follow, according to the University of Western Australia. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_barreiro_jr@rappler.com", "name": "Victor Barreiro Jr.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Biodiversity,_Conservation_and_Attractions_(Western_Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographe_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geographe Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsborough,_Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Western Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Places", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Places", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surf_Life_Saving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surf Life Saving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/04/australia-beached-whales-toby-inlet-april-25-2024-reuters.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510843", "eventUri": "eng-9510843", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 130}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

I've managed (whale strandings) before but nothing ever of this size,\" Wiese told CNN.\n\nIn total, 130 whales were returned to sea after a total of 160 were beached, according to the department of Parks and Wildlife Service Western Australia (DPAW). However at least 28 whales died.\n\nWhale pods can beach themselves again even after being saved. As a result spotter planes in the area are continuing to watch and see if the released animals will return to shore. \"So far, they have remained off the beach,\" Weise said.\n\n\"My initial reaction seeing hundreds of whales all bunched (together) on the beach was just completely and utterly overwhelming. It was really, really chaotic,\" he added.\n\n\"However, the final result was good news - as often with these events, it is only possible to save a few.\"\n\nThe mystery behind whale strandings\n\nAnimal behaviorists and marine scientists have previously said that survival rates for beached whales is low, and the animals \"can only survive for around six hours on land before they start to deteriorate.\"\n\nGroups of locals and wildlife officials worked together to hold the animals upright and \"keep their blowholes clear,\" Wiese said.\n\nAlso present were wildlife officials from the DPAW, as well as experienced veterinarians, trying to save as many whales as possible.\n\nLike other whale species, pilot whales are highly sociable often looking out for each other especially if a member of the pod falls sick or is injured.\n\n\"The remaining whales will play this amazing supportive role,\" Wiese said.\n\n\"When they're out at sea, in deep waters, there's nothing that can disturb that care process but if an injured whale ends up near shore, there will be a lot of hazards (for the pod) that come along and will get in the way... echolocation doesn't work properly and before you know it, you've got a whole family (stranded).\"\n\nHe pointed to a \"newly-born calf\" he had spotted among the stranded group.\n\n\"It was this little baby that still had creases down its body and its umbilical attached,\" Wiese said. \"That may or may not have been a factor of why these animals got to the point of stranding.\"\n\nLast year more than 50 pilot whales died in a mass stranding event in Scotland. The same month wildlife officials in Western Australia said they had to make a heart-breaking decision to euthanize dozens of stranded long-finned pilot whales after a frantic rescue effort to refloat them failed to yield results.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Parks_and_Wildlife_(Western_Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographe_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geographe Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsborough,_Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(animal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calf (animal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-finned_pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long-finned pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowhole_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blowhole (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal echolocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Zoology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/85d282d19298df28d1a389bce03f6a60", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510843", "eventUri": "eng-9510843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

I've managed (whale strandings) before but nothing ever of this size,\" Wiese told CNN.\n\nIn total, 130 whales were returned to sea after a total of 160 were beached, according to the department of Parks and Wildlife Service Western Australia (DPAW). However at least 28 whales died.\n\nWhale pods can beach themselves again even after being saved. As a result spotter planes in the area are continuing to watch and see if the released animals will return to shore. \"So far, they have remained off the beach,\" Weise said.\n\n\"My initial reaction seeing hundreds of whales all bunched (together) on the beach was just completely and utterly overwhelming. It was really, really chaotic,\" he added.\n\n\"However, the final result was good news - as often with these events, it is only possible to save a few.\"\n\nAnimal behaviorists and marine scientists have previously said that survival rates for beached whales is low, and the animals \"can only survive for around six hours on land before they start to deteriorate.\"\n\nGroups of locals and wildlife officials worked together to hold the animals upright and \"keep their blowholes clear,\" Wiese said.\n\nAlso present were wildlife officials from the DPAW, as well as experienced veterinarians, trying to save as many whales as possible.\n\nLike other whale species, pilot whales are highly sociable often looking out for each other especially if a member of the pod falls sick or is injured.\n\n\"The remaining whales will play this amazing supportive role,\" Wiese said.\n\n\"When they're out at sea, in deep waters, there's nothing that can disturb that care process but if an injured whale ends up near shore, there will be a lot of hazards (for the pod) that come along and will get in the way... echolocation doesn't work properly and before you know it, you've got a whole family (stranded).\"\n\nHe pointed to a \"newly-born calf\" he had spotted among the stranded group.\n\n\"It was this little baby that still had creases down its body and its umbilical attached,\" Wiese said. \"That may or may not have been a factor of why these animals got to the point of stranding.\"\n\nLast year more than 50 pilot whales died in a mass stranding event in Scotland. The same month wildlife officials in Western Australia said they had to make a heart-breaking decision to euthanize dozens of stranded long-finned pilot whales after a frantic rescue effort to refloat them failed to yield results.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Ian Wiese, from whale conservation group Geographe Marine Research, said more than 100 volunteers were at the scene.\n\n\"They were trying to comfort them and make sure that their heads were out of the water so they could breathe,\" Wiese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television from the estuary. In July last year, more than 50 pilot whales died after stranding on a remote Western Australia beach. The state experienced its largest whale stranding at Dunsborough in 1996 when 320 pilot whales beached themselves.\n\nPilot whales are known for their tight-knit social bonds, so when one gets into difficulty and strands, the rest often follow, according to the University of Western Australia.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pilot whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Biodiversity,_Conservation_and_Attractions_(Western_Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (Western Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographe_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geographe Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Estuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cetacean stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsborough,_Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunsborough, Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Western Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Places", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Places", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surf_Life_Saving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surf Life Saving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_29_44_9544197.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510843", "eventUri": "eng-9510843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

they try to rescue the whales.\n\nThey have also issued a shark advice for the area, saying it was possible that dead and injured animals could attract leading sharks close to shore.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development said Parks and Wildlife Service officers were leading the response and managing the mass stranding incident.\n\n\"While it is not uncommon for sharks to be present off the Western Australian coast throughout the year, people should exercise additional caution,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Take additional caution in the Toby's Inlet area.\"\n\nPolice are assisting authorities and wildlife rescuers with the response to the large number of whales stranded at Toby's Inlet.\n\nOfficers have urged people to keep clear of the area unless they have been in contact with Parks and Wildlife in relation to providing assistance.\n\n\"While we appreciate the strong desire to help, the area has become overcrowded with volunteers who are impacting on authorities attempting to mobilise a response,\" a police spokesperson said.\n\n\"If your vehicle is parked on Caves Road, please considering moving it to allow for the access of resources.\n\n\"Your cooperation is very much appreciated.\"\n\nA Parks and Wildlife spokesperson said they knew people wanted to help but asked that people did not attempt to rescue the whales without direction from DBCA staff, because it could cause further injury and distress to the animals and hinder a coordinated rescue effort.\n\n\"If you would like to help, please contact the Parks and Wildlife Service Busselton office on 9752 5555,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The highest priority at mass whale stranding events is always human safety followed by animal welfare.\n\n\"We want all staff and volunteers to go home safe.\n\n\"We ask that people please follow instructions of DBCA staff to ensure the highest human safety and animal welfare outcomes are achieved.\"\n\nDunsborough & Busselton Wildlife Care Inc said on social media that they were at the scene with DBCA, rangers and others to help rescue the whales and asked people to stay away.\n\n\"The public are now hindering procedures and lots dogs and kids (are) causing more problems, please stay away and do not call us, we are here,\" they said.\n\nA person commented that it was \"absolutely disgusting that people would take their dogs down their stressing (the) animals further and even further horrifying to think that people are letting their child climb on the dead whales... so disrespectful.\"", "source":

Many animal rights activists and residents rushed to the beach to drown the animals in water and thus keep them alive. However, the authorities asked residents not to approach the whales except under the supervision of experts.\n\n\"We know people want to help, but we have asked them not to attempt to rescue the animals without guidance from DBCA staff, as this may cause further injury and stress to the animals and hinder a coordinated rescue,\" Western Australia State Parks said.

At that time almost all the animals survived. In 2018, 100 ocean giants died after a mass stranding in Hamelin Bay, Western Australia. Last year, nearly 100 pilot whales stranded on Chains Beach, east of Albany, in Western Australia. Despite all the efforts of emergency services and volunteers, none of the animals survived.

Rescuers told Yahoo News their efforts to save the animals were being hampered by the presence of children who are reportedly riding the bodies of dead whales, roaming dogs, and rubberneckers who have clogged the car park.\n\nEarlier, over 100 whales were reported beached on Toby's Inlet, near Dunsborough, 250 km south of Perth. The Department of Conservation (DBCA) immediately took to social media to remind those wishing to help that the whales were likely stressed and to stay away unless they had registered as a volunteer.\n\n\"The highest priority at mass whale stranding events is always human safety followed by animal welfare. We want all staff and volunteers to go home safe,\" it said on social media on Thursday.\n\nUnfortunately many people in the area did not listen, and many are reportedly inadvertently hampering rescue efforts. Yahoo does not suggest these accusations relate to anyone pictured in this story.\n\nAn exhausted Sasha Boundy from Dunsborough and Busselton Wildlife Care was losing her voice as she spoke to Yahoo News late Thursday morning (local time) after several hours volunteering to help the whales. Over 25 whales have been pushed out sea by the volunteers and efforts were ongoing to save more. Sadly at least 23 have died.\n\nBut what's frustrating volunteers as they work alongside experienced staff from DBCA and vets from Perth Zoo, is the conduct of many of the onlookers. And they've issued a warning on social media for people to \"please stay away\".\n\n\"It's actually pretty disgusting down there. You've got kids sitting on the dead whales and riding them like ponies and people are taking photos. Which to me is like the ultimate disrespect,\" Boundy told Yahoo.\n\n\"Would you let your kids climb on a gravesite or memorial? No, probably not. So why are you letting your kids climb on dead whales? It's just disgusting.\n\n\"There's kids down there crying and getting lost. It's very traumatic down there. There's a lot of death. There are lots of upset people. There's dogs running around all over the place causing a nuisance. There's cars parked all over the place causing traffic chaos.\"\n\nBoundy said with so many people at the beach taking photos, it's difficult for rescuers to communicate with one another to actually help the whales. \"You can't see through the crowds of people,\" she added.\n\nA visitor to the beach described the situation as a \"horrible sight\". \"There are masses and masses of volunteers there, and they would have saved probably 20 so far. They've pulled them out to sea as far as they can,\" she told WA Today.\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence about what causes whale strandings, but they have been linked to human activity and environmental changes. In 2023 close to 100 long-finned pilot whales died after they stranded themselves at Cheynes Beach, near Albany in WA. That year, dozens were also found dead on a remote Tasmanian beach.\n\nWA authorities advised anyone wishing to help respond to Thursday's incident should register as a volunteer. Otherwise, despite their best intentions, they risked harming the animals.\n\nThe situation is continuing to evolve and information about the whales remains limited.

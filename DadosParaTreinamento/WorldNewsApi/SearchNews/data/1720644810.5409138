The change will come into effect from midnight on Sunday and will affect passengers travelling from London City, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Leeds/Bradford, Southend and Teesside airports. All of the airports have next generation security checkpoints (NGSC) in operation, which create a 3D image of what is inside passengers\u2019 bags and had allowed them to scrap the rule. The 100ml rule was introduced in 2006 following a foiled terror plot to blow up planes flying from London to the US with home-made liquid bombs. Mark Harper said airline passengers should \u201ccheck with their airport what the rules are\u201d on carrying liquids over 100ml amid some confusion over the restrictions. He told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \u201cThe announcement we\u2019ve made, which comes into force from midnight tonight, actually only affects six regional airports and about 6% of those travelling. \u201cFor most passengers, actually, the rules haven\u2019t changed at all yet and won\u2019t therefore change tonight. People should just check with their airport what the rules are or the processes are at a particular airport. \u201cWe\u2019ve reintroduced that rule while updates and changes are made to the scanning equipment at airports to make sure we can continue delivering our world-leading levels of aviation security. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary measure and we\u2019ll set out when that can be reversed in due course.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Mark Harper said airline passengers should \u2018check with their airport what the rules are\u2019 on carrying liquids over 100ml.</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/mark-harper-london-city-people-leeds-southend-b1163036.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/09/89a81dbd140f9bb954adfc411340f5f7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTIwNzUy-2.76074705.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9EeUO3BD-p4CFAsif.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:27:11", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "authors": ["Sophie Wingate"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.365}

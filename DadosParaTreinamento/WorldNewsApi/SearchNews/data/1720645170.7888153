{"id": 231368920, "title": "US OPEN '24: Payne Stewart indelibly linked to Pinehurst", "text": "Pinehurst No. 2 in the sandhills region of North Carolina has 117 years of golf history behind it. That includes a PGA Championship not many remember, a Ryder Cup before anyone cared and one U.S. Open champion no one can forget. No trip to Pinehurst No. 2 is complete without posing with the statue of Payne Stewart striking as famous a pose as any in U.S. Open history \u2014 left leg planted, right arm thrust forward after he holed a 15-foot par putt on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory over Phil Mickelson. It\u2019s hard to go to Pinehurst without thinking about Payne. Any trip would be emotional for his children, especially the 25-year anniversary of his 1999 U.S. Open title, which came four months before Stewart, three associates and both pilots perished in a freak plane crash. Chelsea Stewart O\u2019Brien was 13 when her father died and now is a mother of two working in strategic partnerships for AT&T. She once wrote that milestone events were the hardest \u2014 the anniversary of his U.S. Open win, the plane crash on Oct. 25, 1999, weddings, births. This week feels different. \u201cHe had such a flair and a joy for life that it\u2019s easy to celebrate him,\u201d she said. \u201cI think as we\u2019ve grown, and our families have grown, we\u2019re trying to remember and instill in our children all he stood for. Now it\u2019s quite an honor to celebrate all he accomplished and the man he was.\u201d She has been back to Pinehurst, most recently when Stewart was posthumously given the Bob Jones Award. So has Aaron Stewart, who was 10 when his father died. He played Pinehurst No. 2 in the fabled North & South Amateur in 2009, even using his dad\u2019s former caddie (Mike Hicks) and the yardage book from that 1999 U.S. Open. \u201cObviously, next week being the 25th anniversary of Dad\u2019s win at Pinehurst has special significance,\u201d said Stewart, who has two young sons and is vice president of sports marketing for Hilton Grand Vacations. Among other things, he runs the LPGA season opener. \u201cPinehurst has been different over the years for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were a few summers I played in the North & South Amateur and competed on the course. Overall, Pinehurst is a special place and a special village. It just means more. \u201cAll the stuff they\u2019re doing to honor Dad and his win is just icing on top of a special place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an emotional week, for sure.\u201d Their mother, Tracey, will be joining them. None of them was there in 1999 when Stewart won his third major, and by far his most famous. He had his trademark knickers and tam o\u2019shanter cap. It was raining, and he ripped out the sleeves of his rain jacket for more freedom in his sweet, fluid swing. Tiger Woods was charging. Mickelson was leading. Stewart, chomping away on his gum, made a 25-foot par putt on the 16th to tie for the lead, a 3-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th to take the lead and that 15-foot par putt on the 18th to win it. His reaction \u2014 now captured by the statue \u2014 still rates among the most memorable in the U.S. Open with Tom Watson\u2019s running toward the 17th hole at Pebble Beach when he chipped in, Hale Irwin racing around the 18th green high-fiving fans at Medinah, Woods pumping his arms after his tying birdie putt at Torrey Pines. \u201cPayne was one of those dramatic individuals,\u201d longtime friend Peter Jacobsen said. \u201cHe made such an impression on the course and off the course. He had a distinctive style, he was a flamboyant dresser. He was recognizable everywhere.\u201d The statue is being moved for the U.S. Open, and that\u2019s a good thing. The USGA wanted better access to it, so it will be relocated from the back of the 18th green to near the entrance, giving spectators a chance to see it and pose with it. \u201cThey been incredible partners to our family,\u201d Ms. Stewart O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s really neat what they\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve been honored to have them think so highly of our dad and have him remembered in that way.\u201d There are ceremonies and other functions planned early in the week \u2014 Jacobsen will be the emcee for one of them \u2014 and Monday marks the launch of a new Payne Stewart Collection clothing line. Yes, it will include a rain vest as part of his wardrobe from that Sunday in 1999. \u201cNo scissors needed,\u201d Aaron Stewart said. They were producing a catalog for the clothing \u2014 knickers and the cap are among the items, but also shorts and sweaters and pants \u2014 and they needed a cover. Aaron Stewart agreed to be the model, going to Pinehurst recently to dress in slacks and an argyle sweater. He struck a familiar pose. Very familiar. \u201cIt was kind of eerie how much he looked like Dad in a couple of pictures,\u201d his sister said. \u201cIt was quite the spectacle to see,\u201d Aaron Stewart said. \u201cThat was on a normal day at Pinehurst. People were walking by and there were a lot of eyeballs.\u201d Stewart died at age 42, just four months after that U.S. Open title that remains so memorable, and a month after the U.S rallied to win the Ryder Cup at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. That was another big moment. \u201cEverything he did was in a big way,\u201d Jacobsen said. The cup was decided and Stewart was on the verge of earning a halve against Colin Montgomerie. The heckling, already ruthless and relentless, reached a point that Stewart walked over and picked up the Scot\u2019s marker to concede the match. Perhaps it\u2019s no wonder Stewart lives as large in death. The Payne Stewart Family Foundation includes golf camps for lower income families. The PGA Tour began the Payne Stewart Award, which has become the most prestigious of all for players. Mrs. Stewart and her children attend in Atlanta each year during the Tour Championship in what always is an emotional night. Scottie Scheffler has been the last few years. He was asked this week for the first thing to come to mind when he hears Stewart\u2019s name. \u201cEither his putt at Pinehurst, and then the Payne Stewart Award is something I always try to go to at East Lake,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cHis legacy and seeing his family there is always really special. He did a lot for the communities that we play in across the country, and he was really an inspirational guy that I look up to as a player just because of the impact he was able to have off the golf course as well.\u201d ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VzLW9wZW4tcGluZWh1cnN0LXBheW5lLXN0ZXdhcnQtMGZmYjA1ZDA1ZTA5NDIzYmI2ODllOWM3NTQ2MDgzODnSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">US OPEN '24: Payne Stewart indelibly linked to Pinehurst</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/us-open-pinehurst-payne-stewart-0ffb05d05e09423bb689e9c754608389", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/71d0c75/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x888+0+552/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F3b%2Fc5%2Fb131c85deaec982138eb2f0a823d%2F35b855822f6c4cc88702b45e1d12362c", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:15:00", "author": "Doug Ferguson", "authors": ["Doug Ferguson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.269}

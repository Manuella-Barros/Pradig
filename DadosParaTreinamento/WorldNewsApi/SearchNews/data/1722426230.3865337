{"id": 243426706, "title": "3 notable streaks end for Dodgers in walk-off loss to Giants", "text": "Three Dodgers streaks came to a crashing halt with one sweet swing of the bat from Brett Wisely on Friday night, the San Francisco second baseman blasting a two-run home run to right field off reliever Blake Treinen in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Giants a 5-3 walk-off win in Oracle Park. The third homer of Wisely\u2019s rookie season snapped a four-game win streak for the Dodgers, who had won 14 of 18 games against their division rivals in Oracle Park since 2022. Dodgers slugger Shohei Ohtani\u2019s franchise-record streak of 10 consecutive games with an RBI came to an end. And so did the peculiar and much-discussed streak of the Dodgers winning 24 straight games in which Miguel Rojas got a hit. They fell to 24-1 in such games after Rojas hit a fifth-inning single to spark a two-run rally. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d a dejected Rojas said afterward. \u201cI just want to thank all the Dodgers fans out there and the people who have been watching. The support has been amazing. I've seen all the posts on social media. It was overwhelming. \u2026 But at the end of the day, this is part of the game. I enjoyed it. Hopefully we start another streak tomorrow.\u201d The Giants took a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the sixth on Matt Chapman\u2019s two-run home run off Daniel Hudson, but the Dodgers rallied to tie the score off hard-throwing San Francisco closer Camilo Doval in the top of the ninth, buoying the spirits of Rojas and the Dodgers. Andy Pages, after avoiding a 99.5-mph first-pitch cut-fastball at his head, smacked Doval\u2019s second pitch, another 99.5-mph cutter, to center field, where Heliot Ramos raced to his right and got his glove on the ball with a lunge but couldn\u2019t hold on. The ball rolled to the wall for a leadoff triple, and Jason Heyward\u2019s sacrifice fly to left tied the score 3-3. \u201cAs soon as Pages hit the ball and it dropped and he got to third base, I knew we had a chance to win,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cAll we needed to do was get back in the dugout, and with the ghost runner at second base [in extra innings], we\u2019d have a good chance to score. Then we have Evan [Phillips] in the 10th \u2026 but it was a tough one there for Blake.\u201d Treinen walked Luis Matos on four pitches, only one of which was close to the strike zone, to open the bottom of the ninth. He threw four pitches, one cutter and three sliders, down and in to the left-handed-hitting Wisely, but the last one, on a 1-and-2 pitch, caught too much of the plate. Wisely stroked a 401-foot homer over the tall wall in right to give the Giants their 31st walk-off win over the Dodgers since the teams moved west from New York City in 1958. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even know where the pitch ended up that he hit,\u201d Treinen said. \u201cI threw two good sliders before that. Swung and missed on one. Seemed like the right pitch at that time. \u2026 It\u2019s all about execution, and sometimes they execute better than we do.\u201d Treinen wasn\u2019t the only reliever to get roughed up in a bullpen that entered with a 13-inning scoreless streak. Hudson, who was 4-1 with a 1.71 ERA, three saves and 12 holds in his first 32 games, entered in the sixth with a 2-1 lead, but he left a 95-mph fastball middle-in to Chapman, who crushed a 414-foot homer to left-center. Ramos reached on first baseman Freddie Freeman\u2019s error to open the inning. \u201cThe leadoff walk by Blake wasn\u2019t ideal,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cThen he had count leverage [on Wisely] and left a pitch out over [the plate]. Huddy tried to go down and away to Chapman and just made a mistake with the heater. He made us pay. They can\u2019t be perfect. It\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d Landon Knack gave the Dodgers 4 \u2154 solid innings in which the rookie right-hander allowed one run and five hits, struck out seven and walked none to lower his ERA to 2.08 in 30 \u2153 innings over six starts this season. With injured starters Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Walker Buehler and Clayton Kershaw all weeks away from potential returns, Knack, who made three starts after a mid-April promotion to the big leagues and one spot start for the Dodgers in May, will get an extended look in the rotation. \u201cI\u2019m continuing to keep the same mindset,\u201d Knack said. \u201cI mean, you never know when your last outing is going to be up here. You just continue to take it day by day and continue to work on your craft.\u201d The Giants could fill a rotation with the five starters they have on their injured list \u2014 Blake Snell, Robbie Ray, Alex Cobb, Kyle Harrison and Keaton Winn \u2014 and their starting staff is so thin they will go with bullpen games on Saturday and Sunday. One of the few quality starters still standing, Logan Webb, gave his team a quality start, limiting the Dodgers to two earned runs and five hits in seven innings, striking out six and walking three to lower his ERA to 3.12. Webb also started double plays on comebackers in the fifth and seventh innings. \u201cHis ball just moves all over the place, and it\u2019s hard to square up,\u201d Roberts said of Webb. \u201cHe was in a good rhythm \u2026 he\u2019s one of the better pitchers in the game.\u201d The Dodgers managed only two infield singles in the first four innings before scoring twice in the fifth, a rally that began with a Rojas single to right field and a Gavin Lux RBI double to the wall in left-center. Lux took third on a wild pitch, Cavan Biggio struck out looking. The hot-hitting Ohtani was intentionally walked ahead of struggling catcher Will Smith, who was mired in a two-for-36 slump (.056) before lining an RBI single to center. The Giants got one run back in the bottom of the fifth when Matos hit a one-out solo homer to left-center off Knack. Wisely singled to right and took third on Jorge Soler\u2019s two-out single to right. Left-hander Anthony Banda replaced Knack and got LaMonte Wade Jr. to ground to second, ending the inning, but two of the Dodgers\u2019 best right-handers, Hudson and Treinen, gave up two-run homers, each one electrifying a sellout crowd of 40,052. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of in and out as far as how they're playing, but they bring their best against us,\u201d Roberts said of the Giants (39-42). \u201cYou can just see the emotion with Webb and some of the plays they made, some of the at-bats. We somehow bring out the best in every team, but that's what we signed up for.\u201d Third baseman Max Muncy, out since May 15 because of an oblique strain, joined the team in San Francisco and has begun swinging the bat, hitting soft-toss and balls off a tee. Muncy was moved to the 60-day injured list last week and won\u2019t be eligible to return until after the All-Star break, but he at least appears to be making progress. \u201cGuys on the IL typically don't travel with us, but in this particular case, it's three days, and our hitting guys can put some eyes on him,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe next step is hitting on the field. He\u2019s taking grounders, throwing, running, so at some point in time, he'll take live batting practice, do a simulated game and from there, go on a rehab [assignment].\u201d Muncy aggravated the injury when he started hitting in the cage two weeks after going on the IL and did not swing a bat for almost a month, so the Dodgers are not about to rush him back. \u201cIt\u2019s open-ended,\u201d Roberts said, when asked if Muncy will be ready to return when his 60-day IL stint is up. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he progresses. We\u2019ve already had one setback, we don\u2019t need another.\u201d Muncy started to ramp up his activity two weeks after the injury but had a setback and had to shut down his attempts to swing a bat. He has started that process again this past week, hitting off a tee and \"flips\" from coaches.", "summary": "Brett Wisely hits a walk-off home run in the ninth for San Francisco, and notable streaks end for Shohei Ohtani and Miguel Rojas in the Dodgers' 5-3 loss.", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2024-06-28/blake-treinen-walk-off-home-run-brett-wisely-dodgers-giants", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10dca9b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8271x4342+1+906/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff8%2F1c%2F2799289d4dacab078190def999f9%2Fdodgers-giants-baseb", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:43:05", "author": "Mike Digiovanna", "authors": ["Mike Digiovanna"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.202}

The first sight is the synthetic turf field used by players rehabilitating from injuries. Players like Talanoa Hufanga, who is five months removed from surgery on his right knee. Hufanga, a 2022 All-Pro safety, looks on track to become the 49ers\u2019 latest to conquer a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Nick Bosa did so in 2021, and Jimmy Garoppolo in 2019; both sustained their ACL tears in Week 3 of the previous season, and both were back by the next season opener. Hufanga\u2019s injury came last Nov. 19 against Tampa Bay. The 49ers open this season Sept. 9 (hosting the New York Jets on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d). That is a shorter window to recover. Presently, Hufanga is attacking his strength program with familiar, upbeat determination. That gives the 49ers hope for a smooth, rapid transition back to their defense \u2014 while they sort through contingency plans. \u201cMain thing with him is he\u2019s got experience and he is a heck of a player,\u201d defensive coordinator Nick Sorensen said. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s really, really good at communicating. He\u2019s smart, he sees things, has a full understanding of our system, and when he gets back we\u2019re going to be excited. I know he is excited.\u201d The 49ers have paired veteran George Odum and second-year starter Ji\u2019Ayir Brown on the first string in spring workouts. Then it\u2019s Erik Harris and Tayler Hawkins, followed by rookies Malik Mustapha (fourth round) and Jaylen Mahoney (undrafted). Tashaun Gipson remains a free agent after two seasons with the 49ers, and a slew of other veterans could be had if the 49ers like their system fit. The free agent backlog includes Quandre Diggs (Seahawks), Justin Simmons (Broncos), Eddie Jackson (Bears), Micah Hyde (Bills), Marcus Maye (Saints), Jamal Adams (Seahawks), Jayron Kearse (Cowboys) and Ryan Neal (Bucs). Brown looks locked into a starting role, so the pressing question is whether the 49ers will have Hufanga available Week 1 or whether others must bridge that role until he is. It\u2019s not out of the question a free-agent veteran could seize a starting job on a Super Bowl-caliber roster. Safeties coach Daniel Bullocks believes Brown\u2019s experience as a rookie could help him big time in Year 2. \u201cMost guys do make their biggest jump the next year. Look at Talanoa Hufanga who started five or six games his rookie year and was All-Pro the second year,\u201d Bullocks said. \u201cJust having that year, understanding the scheme from a mental standpoint, the game has slowed down for him and that allows him to play faster,\u201d Bullocks added. \u201c\u2026 Now he knows his role, he understands the scheme, understands his job, what happens presnap he can take it all in. When the ball is snapped it allows him to play faster.\u201d Contact is not allowed in spring workouts, so all safeties have restrained themselves from delivering hits. Odum looked especially hungry and active; he has been one of the NFL\u2019s top players on special teams for years and he rushed back last season from biceps surgery to play in the postseason. When Wednesday\u2019s 7-on-7 session opened, Deebo Samuel was floored when he ran into Odum after catching a Brock Purdy pass. Mustapha (5-foot-10, 206 pounds) may have the most upside of all those players. Mentoring him on the sideline during organized team activities was Bullocks, who is recovering himself from a torn Achilles in the Super Bowl. Bullocks adores the well-built Mustapha\u2019s tackling ability, \u201cfluid hips,\u201d and versatility to play near the line of scrimmage. \u201cHe can come down in a box, he can bang, he can blitz. He\u2019s one of the best-tackling DBs in the draft,\u201d Bullocks said. \u201cAs a defense, you want guys that can tackle because when I tell guys, \u2018What\u2019s your number one stat? Your number one stat is gonna be tackles. You\u2019re gonna be making more tackles than anything else.\u2019 So you need a guy that can tackle and have the right mindset and the mentality.\u201d", "summary": "The 49ers spent this spring sorting though their in-house options at safety while Talanoa Hufanga recovers from knee reconstruction as big-name veterans sit on the free agent market.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/06/02/talanoa-hufangas-acl-comeback-clouds-49ers-safety-situation/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BNG-L-49ERS-0922-42.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:30:59", "author": "Cam Inman", "authors": ["Cam Inman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.07}
